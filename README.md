# topic-modeling-tool

A GUI for MALLET's implementation of LDA Topic modeling.

From the [original version](http://code.google.com/p/topic-modeling-tool
) by [David Newman](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~newman/) and [Arun Balagopalan](https://github.com/arunbg).

This verison implements basic metadata integration as well as basic support for MALLET's advanced alpha and beta optimization routines. Regex token parsing coming soon!
