# topic-modeling-tool

A GUI for MALLET's implementation of LDA Topic modeling.

From the [original version](http://code.google.com/p/topic-modeling-tool
) by [David Newman](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~newman/) and [Arun Balagopalan](https://github.com/arunbg).

This verison implements basic metadata integration as well as basic support for MALLET's advanced alpha and beta optimization routines. Regex token parsing coming soon!

Caveat emptor! Individual file (a.k.a. CSV) input is disabled, and lots of little things still need fixing. If something bugs you, feel free to submit an issue.
