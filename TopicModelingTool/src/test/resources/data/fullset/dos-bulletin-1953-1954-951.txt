Travel Talks With Foreign Olﬂclals
The Department of State has established new
procedures to insure that the question of inter-
national travel will be discussed wherever appro-
priate with visiting foreign oﬁicials, as was done
in the case of the recent visit of high-level Spanish
oilicials. Steps are now bein taken by the Depart-
ment of State to see that t e basic standing in-
struction to all our foreign service personnel will
take speciﬁc account of the em hasis placed on
international travel by the President. This will
further insure that the subject will be given ade-
quate attention in future discussions with other
nations.
One special aspect of our international discus-
sion on the question of international travel per-
tains to the visa which some nations, including this
one, require for entr by nonresidents of the coun-
try. T 1e necessity or a visa is often a burden to
the traveler, particularly if he intends to visit sev-
eral countries, each of which requires a visa. The
State Department has been successful in securing
the mitigation of certain onerous regulations con-
nected with the visa or the outright discontinu-
ance of the visa requirement for American travel-
ers to a number of countries, including all of the
countries of Western Europe.
Another way in which this Government can hel
other countries stimulate tourist travel is throng 1
givin these other governments, when they request
it, too nical advice on travel and tourist accommo-
dations. The Department of Commerce is the
agency which rovides this technical assistance.
With the use 0 funds of the Foreign O erations
Administration the Department of ommerce
within the ast ear has sent two travel techni-
cians abroa , an two persons have been brought
to this country from abroad, to study our methods
of accommodating tourists, publicit , statistics,
and other technical aspects of the ﬁeld].
No doubt you are aware that the Department of
Commerce has recently established a travel advis-
ory board composed of 20 high-level representa-
tives of the travel and tourist industr . This com-
mittee was organized too recently to ave had any
signiﬁcant impact on the Government as yet, but
there is good reason to hope that it will prove very
beneﬁcial.
Another step taken by the executive branch
which indirectly should assist international travel
concerns the President’s recommendations for re-
visions in the tax laws, now embodied in H. R.
8300. This bill would provide certain tax in-
centives to American corporations for investing
overseas. These incentives would tend to make it
more attractive for American hotel corporations
to build hotels abroad. Lack of hotel facilities or
inadequate hotels is, as you know, one of the fac-
tors frequently cited as a deterrent to greater
travel abroad.
One further area where the efforts of this coun-
try, combined with those of other free nations,
may have a very marked effect on international
travel is that of currency convertibility. At the
present time, the inability of travelers to convert
foreign currencies readily from one to another is
an inconvenience, particularly if the are going to
visit two or more countries. One 0 the basic ob-
jectives of this administration as enunciated in
the President’s messa e on foreign economic pol-
ic is the creation of t lose conditions in the world
which will ermit major currencies to become con-
vertible. nternational travel will be greatly
facilitated thereby.
In concluding this, may I mention that the issu-
ance of passports, as an indication of the prospec-
tive level of international travel by Americans, is
alread very high. Whereas in previous years, the
rate 0 50,000 or more ass orts issued in 1 month
was not attained until Kpri or even May, in prepa-
ration for this summer’s travel, over 50,000 pass-
ports were issued this year in the month of March,
and it seems possible that we might reach an all-
time eak of over 60,000 passports issued in the
month) of May. This is a hopeful sign for a very
big tourist year.
I agree fully that the promotion of tourist travel
is of at signiﬁcance to this Nation and to all
other ree nations. I shall be glad to do anything
that I can to be of assistance.
Please let me know if I can be of any further
service to you.
Sincerely yours,
CLARENCE B. RANDALL,
Special Consultant to the President.
