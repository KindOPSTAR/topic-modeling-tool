immediately with the necessary surveys and siting
for the pro osed new early warnin radar system.
This work is already well advancetf.
There are many difﬁcult problems to be solved
in establishing this additional early warnin sys-
tem in the Canadian North. The system W] 1 ex-
tend over thousands of miles and its survey will
involve the examination of a great number of
possible sites. Much of the round is inaccessible
except by tractor train and elicopter. In many
areas extreme temperatures are confronted for
several months of the year. Many technical prob-
lems, including the interference of the Auroral
Belt with electronic devices, have had to be over-
come. In overcoming the various technical prob-
lems involved the United States Air Force is work-
ing closely with the Royal Canadian Air Force.
It is obviously just as important to have early
warnin of aircraft approaching target areas in
North erica from over the sea as from over
Northern Canada. For this reason, the United
States Government is extending the early warn-
ing barrier across the northeastern and northwest-
ern seaward approaches to North America. The
Alaska radar system is coordinated with those in
Canada and the continental United States, and
the development of airborne radar is well ad-
vanced.
In addition to these measures of common con-
cern, both countries are working continuously to
improve the air defense installations in the vicinity
of the ma'or target areas. Here too, cooperation
between t e United States and Canadian air de-
fense commanders is close, and unidentiﬁed air-
craft are investigated by the most immediately
available interceptor force, whether Canadian or
American.
The defense of North America is part of the
defense of the North Atlantic Region to which
both Canada and the United States are pledged
as signatories of the North Atlantic Treaty. Thus.
the cooperative arrangements for the defense of
this continent and for the participation of Cana-
dian and United States Forces in the defense of
Europe are simply two sides of the same coin, two
parts of a worldwide objective, to preserve peace
and to defend freedom.
