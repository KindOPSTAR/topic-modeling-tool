abuses of freedom. Doubtless it will do so a ain.
Nevertheless, we are convinced that no socia sys-
tem has ever been invented which is better than
that which puts its trust in human freedom, guided
by education and by religion.
The Soviet delegation, in multiple ways, has
made manifest its fear of freedom and its de-
termination, through its occupation forces and its
control of election processes, to try to make cer-
tain that freedom cannot be exercised in a way
which might be prejudicial to it.
That is why, it seems, the Soviet Forei Min-
ister found it impossible to agree to the uniﬁcation
of Germany through genuinely free all-German
elections, as we proposed, and why he has insisted
that Soviet troops must remain indeﬁnitely in
Austria.
Our discussion of European security has re-
vealed that the Soviet Union believes that its
security depends upon maintaining such a huge
preEonderance of power that every other country
of urope will in fact be subject to its coercion.
The Soviet Union opposes any integration of the
Western European countries, or any association
with the United States, which would create suf-
ﬁcient defensive stren th so that the peoples of
\Vestern Europe would in fact feel that they are
masters within their own homes and can develop
their own distinctive ways of life.
"Fear of Freedom"
The Atlantic Charter, to which we all sub-
scribed, called for “freedom from fear.” Today,
unha ily, the dominant note in much of the
worl is “fear of freedom.” It is the conﬂict be-
tween those two concepts which has made it
impossible here to achieve any large measure of
agreement.
‘Ve are conﬁdent that the impasse which we
reached here will not be ermanent. We do not
believe that the peoples of, Germany and Austria,
or for that matter of other neighboring nations,
need to bury their hopes. The Soviet leaders will
surely come to see that freedom is not so greatly
to be feared. It develops in men a basic respect
for the rights of others, a sense of human dignity,
a longing for fellowship and community we fare,
which are the most solid props of eace.
I am conﬁdent that if these basic realities be-
come better understood by the Soviet Union, it
will become possible to achieve the free and inde-
pendent Austria which we promised in 1943, and
the uniﬁed Germany which, we said in 1945, was
a purpose of our occupation.
Progress Made by Conference
Despite our conﬂicts of basic principle, we have
made some provress here.
The four ofD us have reached an a reement,
which we hope will be acceptable to t e others
March 1, I954
concerned, which will ermit the holding of a
Korean political con erence. The possibility
emerges of effecting the uniﬁcation of Korea, in
freedom, as had been promised.
There is also provided the chance, if Communist
China wants it, of restoring eace and order in
Indochina and thus enabling t e three Associated
States of Indochina to have freedom and enjoy
it in security.
\Ve have agreed to pursue the four-power
search for agreement on reduction of armaments,
as recommended by the United Nations.
We shall ursue means to alleviate the plight
of eoples 0 Germany and of Austria.
11 addition to what we have done here, we have
learned much. That has a value which is not
to be i ored. It makes it less likely that any
of us siould by inadvertence and miscalculation
do what would risk another war.
This does not mean that the Western nations
will suspend the doing of what strengthens free-
dom and makes apparent its glorious potentials.
If this Conference were to result in a paralysis
of freedom, then indeed it would be a tragic
failure.
The three Western Ministers, each acting freely
for his sovereign and independent nation, have
found agreement on ever aspect of our work.
Thus we have exempliﬁe a society of consent.
If, in that spirit, our nations go on with others
of like mind, to build the strength of freedom,
then we shall win, everywhere, respect. It will
be shared by all who look to us for leadership,
for we shall be guarding and serving their free-
dom, with our own.
Let me, in conclusion, say a personal word. I
thank each of m three colleagues for the clarity
and candor of t eir participations in this Con-
ference and for the uniform courtesy and con-
sideration which each has shown me.
