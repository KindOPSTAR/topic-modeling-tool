American Vice President Nixon has been touring Asian
and Far Eastern countries for the past 6 weeks. . . .
The press considers Nixon's trip as yet another attempt
of U. S. ruling circles to establish a widespread Paciﬁc
military bloc in Asia which would become a supplement
of the aggressive North Atlantic bloc. . The Amer-
ican imperialists are consciously fanning the expansionist
appetite of the Japanese monopolists and mllltarists with
whom they have conspired in their desire to suppress the
resistance of the Japanese people and to transform Japan
into a tool of their policy of aggression against the people
of Asia.
This is the sort of thing with which the Commu-
nists ﬁll the air and the bookstalls of Asia. It is a
good thing for us to be reminded of it. Any illu-
sions we ma have that the Communists would
genuinely li e to reestablish peace and relieve
sources of friction on any terms other than the
progressive destruction of our world should be
dispelled by a knowledge of the viliﬁcation and
abuse that the Communists are constantly ouring
upon us. The Communists tell us every ay that
the only wa in which we can placate them is to
etl'ace ourse ves from the earth. There is no ex-
cuse for our ever being in any doubt on this point.
The Neutrallst Polnt of Vlow
I think it is important also for us to bear in
mind that the Asmns are continuously exposed
to a barrage of anti-American propaganda. The
objective of this ropaganda is to picture the
United States as t e arch enemy of everything
the Asians are struggling for. Actually, the
United States emerges from Communist propa-
nda as havin all the essential features of the
oviet Union. gI‘he chief effect is probably not
so much to win friends for communism as to
stren hen the view of some Asians that the two
sides in the cold war are equally overbearin and
ually wrong and that therefore they, t em-
se ves, can stand aside from the conﬂict. This
is a comforting notion, bringing release from
responsibility. The so-called “neutralist” point
of view was put neatly by a Burmese oﬁicial speak-
ing on the most recent anniversary of his coun-
try’s independence. Listing the problems faced
by the nations of Southeast Asia, he concluded
b stating: “Over and above these there is also
tlile important problem of striving for our aims
contemporary with the circumstances of world
tensions caused mainly by two powerful camps
armed with deadly atomic weapons in the pursuit
of extremist aims and monopolistic philosophies
directly op d to each other. To the misery
of the wor d these tensions are felt outside the
United Nations as well as inside it.”
Here is another typical expression of the neu-
tralist int of view, taken from a criticism of
a possi le United States pro am of military
asmstance to Pakistan in the ndonesian news-
paper Merdeka (meaning freedom) : “Observers
of international roblems here consider American
aid as great as ' as a dangerous threat to the
welfare of the Asian countries located around the
Indian Ocean, including also Indonesia.”
I always have two reactions to neutralist views.
First, I wonder how we can make clearer the
origins of the cold war and the reasons for r0-
ams of American foreign aid. It is so c ear
to us that the United States has come into conﬂict
with the Soviet Union not because we have any
desire to extend our inﬂuence beyond our borders,
not because we have been immediately and di-
rectly threatened by Soviet imperialism, but be-
cause we have responded to requests for assistance
from those nations which, neighborin on the
Communist world, have been immediate y threat-
ened—it is hard to see how the facts could be
made plainer. My second feeling is one of curi-
osity as to whether the neutralists ever stop to
wonder what would hap )en to them if we fol-
lowed their example an also stood back from
the conflict between Communist imperialism and
the rest of the free world and allowed nature to
take its course.
I think it is a mistake, however, to be discour-
aged byeneutralist sentiment in Asia. We must
rem_em r what our objective is. It is not to
achieve popularity or win admirers. Our pur se
is to see that the independence of the Asian natlons
is preserved and that they are able to stand on
their own feet. So long as the Indonesian press
speaks with a genuinely Indonesian voice, so lon
as Burmese foreign service ofﬁcers speak with
gznuinely Burmese voices, our primary purpose is
ing realized—whatever those voices may say.
Moreover, it would not be very becoming to us to
be too shocked by the phenomenon of neutralism.
For the ﬁrst century and a half after our own
achievement of independence, our foreign policy
was devoted to keeping out of the affairs of the
Old World and keepin the Old World out of the
aﬁairs of the New. ortunately for us, during
our ﬁrst century, we were geogra hically remote
from the theaters of ma'or con ict, unlike the
Asians today, and mercifu ly were threatened with
no such worldwide conspiracy as the Communist
International. Moreover, the security of the
Western Hemisphere had an eﬁ'ective defender in
the form of the British Navy. Nevertheless, we
were too long in discovering that in the 20th cen-
tury no nation is geogra hically remote. We
learned in 1917 and 1941 t at, for nations today,
the cost of escaping involvement in a world at
peace is apt to be involvement in a world at war
from which they cannot escape.
It is to avoid a repetition of two world wars
that we are now striving to help develop in the
free world, East and West, a strength sufﬁcient to
stay the aggressor’s hand. It is to avoid having
once again to ﬁght to the death for our survival
in circumstances of the aggressor’s choosing—in a
war that this time we could not see the end of.
It is our responsibility to contribute all we can
to the creation of that strength because without us
