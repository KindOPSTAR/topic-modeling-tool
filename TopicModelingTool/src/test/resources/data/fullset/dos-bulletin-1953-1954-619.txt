number of college presidents, both men and
women, and certain government ofﬁcials serving
in their private capacity. Its director is a Dean
of Yvomen in one of our great American uni-
verSities.
The Commission has issued a statement on its
proposed study. It recognizes that the primary
responsibilities of American women relate to the
family and the home. It also recognizes that
more and more women are assuming expanded
roles in other vocations and in community inter-
ests. The Commission is not interested in securin
special privileges for women. It is concerne
with the welfare of the United States and with
the contribution every person can make to our
society. The proposed study therefore includes
research on the special aptitudes of women, on the
inﬂuence of education, culture patterns, and social
attitudes upon women and on their contribution
as distinct from those of men. It does not look
forward to a plan of education for women which
will be different from that of men, but rather
that the curricula for all students can be enlarged
to provide an understanding of the role which
women play, and should be prepared to play, in
our society.
Turning back to the Umsoo report, I would like
to comment on the emphasis in some countries on
special curricula for irls. It is natural and
healthy that girls shou (1 wish to study domestic
science and home economics and all the aspects of
family life. Without such interests few women
will feel that their lives have been satisfying.
Courses in cookin , sewing, home nursing, and
child care are usuaIl oﬁered in our schools on an
elective basis, so that a girl choosing these courses
is not able to take others scheduled at the same
time. The same problem appears in vocational
training, where it is often eXpected that the girls
will elect home economics while the boys study
agriculture. I speak with some feeling on this,
because I live in a farm area and know that a
farmer needs a Wife who understands his work.
It is therefore not just a matter of providin
the same choices for girls and boys, but also 0
presenting these courses in ways which will not
make it necessary for a girl who chooses domestic
zcileéice to lose out on opportunities to study other
e s.
FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION
The discussion of fundamental education be-
gins with a description of objectives which will
help us clarify our recommendations. While fun-
damental education is intended for adults, men
and women alike, who have not had an oppor-
tunity to go to school, its aim is to raise the stand-
ard of living of people, improve their health con-
ditions, and help them become informed citizens.
The discussion includes a sentence which applies
in many aspects of our work: “No fundamental
education project is really successful in changing
the conditions of a community if it is limited to
men.” A country can achieve full development
only when women are able to carry resgionmbili-
ties as partners in all phases of ciV1c 11 e. From
this point of view the success of theemergency
program for Arab refugees in attracting girls to
school promises well for their future.
The same view is expressed in the report of the
Education of Girls in N on-Self-Governing Terri-
tories. The introduction to this report says,
All improvements in the homes and in the bringing up of
children will be delayed until a great drive is made to
educate women and girls. . . . If men from primary or
secondary schools marry wives who have had no school-
ing . . . the educated fathers will have the greatest dtﬂl-
culty in passing on the beneﬁts of their schooling to the
children.
The rogress apparent in this report is astonish-
ing; w ile there are still ga 8, there are areas in
which the proportion of gir s in the total enroll-
ment approaches the expected 50 percent.
More Teachers and More Women In Teachlng
A universal problem in these days seems to be a
shorta e of teachers. In some countries the short-
age re ects inadequate pay scales; in others it_ is
due to a lack of training facilities and recruits.
The countries where fewer girls attend school, and
for shorter periods, are for the most part in this
second roup, and until more teachers can be
found, t ere will not be enough schools to 0
around. In the United States, most of our teac -
ers have been women. This is true especiall in
our primary grades, ossiny because we thin of
primary schools as a rst transition from the home.
In countries where women have not been a large
part of the teaching force, it would seem easy for
them to be accepted ﬁrst in the primary grades.
However, I would not wish this comment to be
taken in any way as a limitation, for in the United
States some of our greatest university professors
and secondary school teachers are women who are
recognized everywhere for ability and capacity.
Fellowshlps and Scholarshlps
A ﬁnal section of the Umsco report deals with
scholarships and other opportunities for study in
foreign countries. As we expected, fewer women
than men have received grants, and in some cases
the disproportion seems unduly great. We should
not expect that young women Will undertake ad-
vanced study to the same extent as young men, for
it is just at this oint that girls tend to ma
and need to be at Ihome with their children. e
should therefore feel encouragement that in al-
most all categories listed, some girls and women
are included. This proportion should increase,
for choices seem to be made in terms of qualiﬁca-
tions without regard to sex. However, this is a
