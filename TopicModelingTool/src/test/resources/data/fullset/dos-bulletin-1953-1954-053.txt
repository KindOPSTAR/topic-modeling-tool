Let us think of that labor—or rather that Latin
American laborer employed b a U. S. company.
He is probably not well e ucated, and he is
desperately poor. He may well have imbibed with
his mother’s milk a sense of oppression and ex-
ploitation—and a consequent suspicion of for-
eigners. He can see that the foreign company
em loying him has great resources, else how could
it 0 what it does? Why should the foreign man-
agers live so much better than he?
Now, you and I of course know the answers.
The great resources are the pooled savings of
thousands of investors. Foreign capital will in
its own interest employ natives of the country
to the full extent they are available, but it wi 1
wish to employ its own representatives in key jobs,
and it will have to bring in trained employees for
specialized 'obs it cannot for the moment ﬁll
locall —an those people will obviously have to
be paid at United States, not local, rates. As for
labor or anization, United States companies in-
creasing y recognize that responsible organized
labor is a stabilizing force with which it is to their
self-interest to cooperate, and many American
managers are likely to remember instinctively in
Latin America the more advanced labor relations
practices they learned in the United States. It is
not, however, the role of American companies to
reform foreign lands; it is their elementary duty
to respect the laws and authorities in countries in
which they 0 erate.
Let us think equally of the Latin American
intellectual who is troubled by the economic in-
ﬂuence of the United States in his country. He
sees irre laceable natural resources—oil, copper,
zinc, leag, iron ore—being extracted by foreign
companies. The companies doing this often are
more important proportionately in his country
than our greatest corporations are in the United
States. As the internal economy of his country
may depend in important measure on United
States companies, so its economic prosperity may
depend on the market for its exports in the United
States. He naturally resents the booms and busts
of his national economy which arise from rela-
tively small economic ﬂuctuations in the United
States, and be deeply resents the occasions on
which we try, by protecting domestic producers,
to export our misery and thereby add to his.
Everywhere he turns in seeking to raise living
standards—and remember, per capita income in
Latin America is but one-eighth of ours—he en-
counters some economic interest of ours, and it is
not surprising if he mistakenly thinks it is block-
ing his way.
It does not occur to him that natural resources
are worth nothing till developed, that, for exam-
ple, the Guayra Falls, probably the greatest poten-
tial source of hydraulic power in the world, beside
which Niagara is only a leaky faucet, will be of
value only when capital is used to develop it—
and they are so remote that we may be using atomic
ower plants ﬁrst. He may equally for et what
iving standards in his country would be i foreign
capital had not come to it, or how much higher
they would be if his government’s policies had
been wiser. He forgets that Henr Ford made
good proﬁts and certainly did the nited States
no harm.
Need for Reciprocal Understandlng
In short, our problems in our inter-American
relations are largely economic, and they largely
boil down to the question of how we are going to
cooperate in the economic sphere to our mutual
beneﬁt. The ﬁrst requisite of such cooperation is
reciprocal understanding. \Ve must understand
what our trade policy, our loan policy, our other
economic policies mean to them, and that what is a
triﬂe to us may spell disaster to them. In turn,
our sister republics should appreciate the immense
burdens which world leadership has placed on our
shoulders and should realize that the treatment
they give to foreign capital is far more important
to them than it is to the United States. We have
learned in the United States that capital and labor
can work together to their mutual proﬁt; we must
not be deterred either by selﬁshness or misguided
agitation from working together with our sister
republics in the economic ﬁeld for our mutual
beneﬁt. Our sister republics will follow our
leadership in world affairs only if they think it to
their national advanta e. As to the possibilities
of going it alone, I thin of Secretar Dulles’ wise
words in this regard. I trust that t rough SliOI't—
sightedness we shall never be compelled to defend
our national existence along our national frontiers.
That is the meaning of our relations with our
sister republics. \Ve do not believe that our con-
cerns end at the Rio Grande. \Ve know that
through our continental solidarity we were spared
throughout this hemisphere the devastation of
World War II, and we ﬁrmly believe that holds a
lesson for the future. We seek so to order our
hemispheric relations that we shall enrich our-
selves and our good neighbors, spiritually and
materially, by living with them in this hemisphere
in understanding and harmony. If we were to
heed the voices of selﬁshness, or to let Communist
agitation corrode our common sense, we could
easily destroy our future and ourselves. But I
am conﬁdent that the Americas will not follow any
such shortsighted path. The Americas are visibly
on the march toward a better, brighter future, and
we must go forward together in attaining it.
Destiny has thrust upon this new world—this
American Continent—a vital role in the future
of mankind. The future history of the world
will be increasingly written in the 21 sister repub-
lics of the Americas. May it be not only the story
of understanding and cooperation for the beneﬁt
