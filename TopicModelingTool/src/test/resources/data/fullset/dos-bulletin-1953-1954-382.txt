India. And I am conﬁrming ublicly that if our
aid to any countr , including akistan, is misused
and directed against another in aggression I will
undertake immediately, in accordance with m
constitutional authority, appropriate action botli
within and without the UN to thwart such a -
ression. I believe that the Pakistan-Turkey co -
aboration agreement which is being discussed is
sound evidence of the defensive purposes which
both countries have in mind.
I know that you and your Government are
keenly aware of the need for economic progress
as a rime requisite for stability and strength.
This overnment has extended assistance to India
in recognition of this fact, and I am recommending
to Congress a continuation of economic and tech-
nical aid for this reason. We also believe it in the
interest of the free world that India have a strong
military defense capability and have admired the
effective way your Government has administered
your military establishment. If your Govern-
ment should conclude that circumstances require
military aid of a type contemplated by our mutual
security legislation, please be assured that your
r uest would receive my most sympathetic con-
si eration.
I regret that there has been such widespread
and unfounded speculation on this subject. Now
that the facts are known, I hope that the real
import of our decision will be understood.
\Vith best wishes,
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT
On February 19th, Turkey and Pakistan an-
nounced their intention to study methods of
achieving closer collaboration on various matters
including means designed towards strengthenin
peace and security. This Government welcome
this move and called it a constructive step towards
better ensuring the security of the whole area of
the Middle East. The Government of Pakistan
has now asked the United States to grant military
assistance.
I have said repeatedly that regional groupings
to ensure security against aggression constitute the
most effective means to assure survival and prog-
ress. No nation can stand alone today. My
report to the Congress on June 30, 1953 stated
that we should strengthen efforts towards regional
political, military and economic integration. I,
therefore, under the authority granted by the Con-
gress, am glad to comply with Pakistan’s request,
subject to the negotiation of the required MDAP
agreement.
This Government has been gravely concerned
over the weakness of defensive capabilities in the
Middle East. It was for the purpose of helping
to increase the defense potential in this area that
Congress in its last session appropriated funds to
be used to assist those nations in the area which
desired such assistance, which would ledge their
willingness to promote international) eace and
security within the framework of the nited Na-
tions, and which would take effective collective
measures to prevent and remove threats to peace.
Let me make it clear that we shall be guided by
the stated purposes and requirements of the
mutual security legislation. Those include speciﬁ-
cally the provision that equipment, materials or
services provided will be used solely to maintain
the recipient country’s internal security and for
its legitimate self defense, or to permit it to par-
ticipate in the defense of the area of which it is a
part. An recipient country also must undertake
that it will not engage in an act of aggression
against any other nation. hese undertakings
aﬁ'ord adequate assurance to all nations, regard-
less of their political orientation and whatever
their international policies may be, that the arms
the United States provides for the defense of the
free world will in no way threaten their own secu-
rity. I can say that if our aid to an country,
including Pakistan, is misused an directed
against another in a gression I will undertake
immediately, in accor ance with my constitutional
authority, appropriate action both within and
without the UN to thwart such aggression. I
would also consult with the Congress on further
steps.
The United States earnestly desires that there
be increased stability and strength in the Middle
East, as it has desired this same thing in other
parts of the free world. It believes that the
aspirations of the peoples in this area for main-
taining and developing their way of life and for
realizing the social advances close to their hearts
will be best served by strength to deter aggression
and to reduce the fear of aggression. The United
States is prepared to help in this endeavor, if its
help is wanted.
