proggm which has sprayed 12,659 villages to
the neﬁt of more than 4 million people. The
rogram has reduced the disease in some areas
rom around 90 percent to 20 percent and to 10
percent in others.
In another program in Iran a cooperative
United States—Iranian farm project has carried
modern agricultural methods to 20,711 farmers
in 800 villages. Two hundred and ﬁfty-ﬁve Ira-
nian extension agents are being trained.
A rice production program in Borneo is re-
habilitating 370,650 acres of old rice ﬁelds. Rice
production in Bastar, India, has been increased
from 400 to 1,200 ounds per acre through the
work of Indian and3 United States farm experts.
Working in cooperation with the Government of
India, 33 United States technicians are helping
train Indian village workers.
United States technicians have advised and as-
sisted the Government of Jordan in the ﬁrst cen-
sus taken in the area since Bible times. “ls are
helping the Government of Saudi Arabia to re-
vamp its monetary system. lVe are advisin on
water development projects in Saudi Ara 1a,
Iran, Jordan, India, and Pakistan.
The United States, through the Foreign Opera-
tions Administration, is providing technicians to
the Afghan Government in the Helmand Valley
Development Project. The project involves an
area of nearly a million acres. Eventually it will
provide permanent homes and a livelihood for a
large number of Afghanistan’s nomadic popula-
tion.
The technical assistance programs are building
a genuine partnership between underdevelope
nations and the United States from which both
will beneﬁt. lVe do not place our reliance solely
on arms and armaments. The United States has
peculiar qualiﬁcations which not only ermit but
compel us to take leadership in the ﬁe d of tech-
nical assistance. \Ve were ourselves once a colo-
nial power winning our independence b revolu-
tion. We have no territorial ambitions. e alone
of the major countries of the free world combine
recent ex erience in self-development as an under-
develope country with ex erience in the use of
modern techniques of r0 uction and distribu-
tion, education and heallfh, to say nothing of our
interest in the culture of other peo les.
We Americans know that the bi lion and more
peoples of the Far East are the largest potential
reservoir of consumer needs in the world. As they
become more prosperous they will need more and
more consumer goods. To a country committed to
expanding production that is an opportunity we
wish to develop.
For us, helping them realize their potential is
an opportunity and an obligation. Certainly the
blessings we as a nation have enjoyed entail cer-
tain responsibilities—moral responsibilities.
That we will beneﬁt materially from the fair
discharge of those responsibilities is beside the

point. Personally I would consider our technical
assistance programs justiﬁed in any case. That
we will also proﬁt otherwise is serendipity, to use
the word coined by Walpole. To translate Wal-
pole—serendipity means unexpected beneﬁts
picked up when in search of something entirely
iﬂ'erent.
The major present threat to the realization of
our ob'ectives is the imperialist ambition of Rus-
sia. hat ambition is not new. It was old when
Ivan the Terrible reigned. That the heart of the
struggle would be Asia was long ago anticipated.
A hundred years ago, Commodore Perry pre-
dicted that the struggle between Russia and the
West would be decided in Asia. He urged then
fortiﬁcation of the ver islands of the Paciﬁc that
we fortiﬁed in World ar II and which we now
hold. Toda the United States and Asia face the
danger of w ich Perry warned us.
While we have been slow to heed the Commo-
dore’s warnin , now we certainly reco ize the
accuracy of his forecast. In the Paci c we are
dealing with a region as vital to us as it is vital to
the free world. If the issue, as Perry predicted,
is to be joined there, we must take every step to
make certain that it is resolved in our favor.
