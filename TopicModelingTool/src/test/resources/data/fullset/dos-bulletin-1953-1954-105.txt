to commit U.S. land forces to Asia to a degree
that leaves us no strategic reserves.
It is not sound economics, or good foreign policy,
to support ermanently other countries; for in the
long run, t at creates as much ill will as good will.
Also, it is not sound to become permanently com-
mitted to military ex enditures so vast that they
lead to “practical ban ruptcy.”
Change was imperative to assure the stamina
needed for permanent security. But it was
equall imperative that change should be accom-
ganie by understandin of our true purposes.
udden and spectacular c ange had to be avoided.
Otherwise, there might have been a panic among
our friends and miscalculated aggression by our
enemies. We can, I believe, make a good report in
these respects.
\Ve need allies and collective security. Our
urpose is to make these relations more effective,
ess costly. This can be done b placing more
reliance on deterrent power and ess dependence
on local defensive power.
This is accepted practice so far as local com-
munities are concerned. We kee locks on our
doors, but we do not have an arme guard in every
home. We rely principally on a community se-
curity system so well equipped to punish any who
break in and steal that, in fact, would-be aggres-
sors are generally deterred. That is the modern
way of getting maximum protection at a bearable
cost.
What the Eisenhower administration seeks is a
similar international security system. \Ve want,
for ourselves and the other free nations, a maxi-
mum deterrent at a bearable cost.
Local defense will always be important. But
there is no local defense which alone will contain
the mi hty landpower of the Communist world.
Local efenses must be reinforced by the further
deterrent of massive retaliatory ower. A poten-
tial aggressor must know that e cannot always
prescribe battle conditions that suit him. Other-
wise, for example, a potential aggressor, who is
glutted with manpower, might be tem ted to at-
tack in conﬁdence that resistance wou d be con-
ﬁned to manpower. He might be tempted to
attack in places where his superiority was de-
cisive.
The way to deter aggression is for the free com-
munity to be willing and able to respond vigor-
ously at places and with means of its own
choosing.
So long as our basic policy concepts were un-
clear, our military leaders could not be selective
in building our military power. If an enemy
could pick his time and place and method of war-
fare—and if our policy was to remain the tradi-
tional one of meeting aggression by direct and
local opposition—then we needed to be ready to
ﬁght in the Arctic and in the Tropics; in Asia, the
Near East, and in Europe; by sea, by land, and
by air; with old weapons and with new weapons.
The total cost of our security efforts, at home
and abroad, was over $50 billion per annum, and
involved for 1953, a rojected budgetary deﬁcit
of $9 billion; and $11 ilhon for 1954. This was
on to of taxes comparable to wartime taxes; and
the ollar was depreciating in effective value.
Our allies were similarly weighed down. This
could not be continued for long without grave
budgetary, economic, and social consequences.
But before military planning could be chan ed,
the President and his advisers, as representef by
the National Security Council, had to take some
basic policy decisions. This has been done. The
basic decision was to depend primarily upon a
great capacity to retaliate, instantly, b means and
at Blaces of our choosing. Now the epartment
of efense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff can shape
our military establishment to ﬁt what is our
policy instead of having to try to be ready to
meet the enemy’s many choices. That permits of
a selection of militar means instead of a multi-
plication of means. 5 a result, it is now possible
to get, and share, more basic security at less cost.
The Far East
Let us now see how this concept has been ap-
plied to forei n policy, taking ﬁrst the Far East.
In Korea t is administration eﬁ'ected a major
transformation. The ﬁ hting has been stopped
on honorable terms. T at was possible because
the a gressor already thrown back to and behind
his lace of beginning, was faced with the pos-
sibi ity that the ﬁ hting might, to his own reat
peril, soon spread ieyond the limits and met ods
which he had selected.
The cruel toll of American youth and the non-
productive expenditure of many billions have been
stopped. Also our armed forces are no longer
largely committed to the Asian mainland. \Ve
can begin to create a strategic reserve which
greatly improves our defensive posture.
This change gives added authorityIto the warn-
ing of the members of the United ations which
fought in Korea that, if the Communists renewed
the aggression, the United Nations response would
not necessaril be conﬁned to Korea.
I have said in relation to Indochina that, if there
were open Red Chinese army aggression there,
that would have “grave conse uences which might
not be conﬁned to Indochina. ’
I expressed last month the intention of the
United States to maintain its position in Okinawa.2
This is needed to insure adequate striking power
to implement the collective security concept which
I describe.
All of this is summed up in President Eisen-
hower’s important statement of December 26.a
He announced the progressive reduction of the
U.S. ground forces in Korea. He pointed out-
