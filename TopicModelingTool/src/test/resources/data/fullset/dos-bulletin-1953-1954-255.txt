eral European treaty and an auxiliary proposal
regarding Germany: 1
STATEMENT OF FEBRUARY 5
Press release 58 dated February 8
Since our meeting yesterday, I have read the
transcript of Mr. Molotov’s remarks and have
studied his proposal.2 I can still ﬁnd no en-
couraging interpretation of what we heard yes-
terday afternoon. '
The basic impression which strikes me is this:
Mr. Molotov is afraid of genuine] free elections
in the East Zone. He is afraid t at the 18 mil-
lion Germans in the East Zone, if given a chance
to speak, would overwhelmingly reJect the present
imposed re ime. Mr. Molotov has good reason
to e afrai .
Consequently, the Soviet Forei Minister has
categorically rejected the proposa s for genuinely
free elections which have been put forward by
the Western Powers. In its place he proposes his
own blueprint. In the name of eace, he r0-
poses a method for extending the so id Soviet loc
to the Rhine. In the name of what he calls de-
mocracy, he has set forth the classic Communist
pattern for extinguishing democracy as that word
as been understood for 2,000 years.
The cornerstone of the Soviet proposal is the
so-called government of the German Democratic
Republic. That government was put in ofﬁce by
Soviet power. It was conﬁrmed in ofﬁce by Soviet
ower. If it had not been for elements of 22
oviet divisions, including tanks and armored
cars, it would have been forcibly ejected from
power by the workers who in their desperation
rose up against it last J une.a
It is that regime which under the Soviet plan
would negotiate on a basis of equality with the
government of the German Federal Re ublic.
However, the scales are to be still further weighted

in favor of the Soviet pup et regime, because it
is provided by the Soviet pihn these initial nego-
tiations shall also involve “wide participation of
democratic organizations.”
In the Soviet dictionary the words “democratic
organizations” have a clear, precise meaning.
They mean those front organizations—captive
trade unions, youth organizations, women’s or-
ganizations—which promote the Communist pur-
poses without openly presenting themselves to the
people in their true guise.
It is under these auspices that there would be
pre ared the “all-German electoral law” and the
est. lishment of election conditions.
We can visualize in advance the type of elec-
tions 11 on which the East German regime would
insist, ecause we already know those conditions
from its past. I have already told of the election
conditions which were established in East Ger-
many where the voters were compelled by armed
force and penalties to go to the 011s and, when
there, were compelled to put in t e ballot box a
list of names which had been previously pre ared
for them and which was made publlc on y on
election day.
Indeed, the Soviet plan expressly stipulates in
Communist language that the election conditions
would in fact be what they were in the Soviet
Zone. The election must be so conducted as to
assure its so-called “democratic” character. It
must provide for the participation “of all demo-
cratic organizations.” It must preclude “pres-
sure upon voters by big monopolies,” and it must
exclude from voting privilege any organizations
which by Soviet standards are of a Fascist or
militaristic nature.
If we take the tragic pattern which has spread
all over Eastern Europe in the wake of the Red
armies, it does not require much wit to see what
that means. It means that anyone who dares to
express the slightest doubt concerning commu-
nism is automatically deemed a Fascist or a mili-
tarist or a monopolist.
If this system were to be applied to Western
Germany, no organization op osing the Commu-
nists or the policies of the oviet Communists,
which are the same thing, would be permitted to
take part in the elections.
It would only be the Communist Party and the
Communist-front or anizations which under Mr.
Molotov’s plan woul partici ate in the elections.
I have no doubt that the oviet Foreign Min-
