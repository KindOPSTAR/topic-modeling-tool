Bulldlng a Secure Community
by Thruston B. Morton
Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relations ‘
It is good to be here and to have this chance to
discuss with you the problems the United States
faces in this troubled world.
And no one will deny—it is a sorely troubled
world. Wherever one turns, North or South,
East or \Vest, there is difﬁculty and anxiety. The
United States itself is not exempt. \Ve are, to be
sure, prosperous as, perhaps, never before. But
we are, nevertheless, anxious, uneasy.
It is ironic that such a situation should exist.
Now, when men have at hand the tools to solve
many of their age-old problems. Now, when the
goal of a good life seems attainable. Never in
iistory have men so much right to hope. Yet, the
climate is one of fear and unease.
Hope, to be sure, persists. But, to quote Fran-
cis Bacon, “Hope is a good breakfast but an ill
sup er.” Men in many places are saying that it
is time some of these hopes were realized.
These hopes . . . what are they?
For many the primary ho e is peace—a erma-
nent peace. The world hasqiad enough ofpwar—
hot or cold. It wants freedom from war and the
fear of war. It wants a peace that will give it
the opportunity to ut to work these new tools.
Reasonable men now that we must have peace
to build this brave new world. Convemely they
know that the peace they want is possible only in
such a world.
To many men, however, the picture is not so
clear. The hungry, the homeless, and the sick—to
such men peace as little meaning. Life has little
meaning. As a U.N. delegate remarked, to his
eople four sandwiches had more meanin than
our freedoms. This man happened to e an

unity as the basis of American welfare and secu-
rity. In so doing I am sure that our Government
can depend on the National Conference of Chris-
tians and Jews and the \Vorld Brotherhood in
promoting policies which are so fundamental and
so much in harmony with the purposes of your
organization.
Asian but he spoke for hundreds of millions all
over the world.
We must therefore deal with problems such as
hunger if we wish eace. This is not altruism.
It is a matter of en ightened self-interest. Our
freedom, freedom eve where, will be secure only
in a world where hope eferred does not drive men
to desperation.
Obviously, the United States, alone cannot
settle all the roblems of the world. l‘io single
nation can. he tasks before us require the
united eil'orts of all peace-loving people. We,
therefore, must work to extend this unity of effort.
A few years ago, an eminent historian Dr.
Arthur Schlesi er, Sr.) was asked what ad
been the outstaiiging development of the ﬁrst 50
years of the 20th century. He said it was the
reluctant acce )tance by the United States of world
leadership. e emphasized the “reluctant.”
I might take exception to the emphasis, but
fundamentally he was right. Certainly United
States world leadership has tremendous historical
signiﬁcance.
And what is perhaps more signiﬁcant, we had
the maturity and the courage to face the facts.
We recognized that our preeminent strength made
our leadership historically inevitable.
Prlnclplo of Voluntary Cooperation
How we handle that responsibility is, of course,
a matter of great importance. “'e are using our
position to lead and not to dominate. Among the
non-Communist nations we have sought, and are
seeking, allies and friends—not satellites. The
master-and-slave relationship is a Communist
technique that is anathema to free peoples.
