the Soviet Government is requested to state precisely
what articles were picked up. and what has been done with
those articles, and to arrange with the United States
Government for the prompt return of the property wher-
ever it may now be situated.
B. The United States Government is aware that the
Soviet Government stated in its note of August 26, 1953,
that it had no knowledge with respect to the existence of
survivors. The United States Government must state
that its own study of the known facts leads it to believe
that it is highly likely that Soviet authorities—certainly
since August 26, 1953—may have become informed with
respect to the fate of the BB-50 crew members, either be-
cause one or more such crew members were picked up on
the sea by Soviet nationals, or picked up on the land by
Soviet nationals after being swept to the adjacent Soviet
shores by sea currents; or because, if dead, the bodies of
such crew members may have drifted to or near the
Soviet shore where they could be detected or picked up.
The United States Government requests the Soviet
Government (a) to inform it of all the relevant facts in
this regard if these facts are already in the Soviet Gov-
ernment’s possession or (b) to investigate, if it has not
already done so, the question of identification of persons
dead or alive who may have been members of the RB—50
crew and have come into the custody of Soviet authorities
or of persons subject to Soviet Jurisdiction, and to inform
the United States Government of the results of the in-
vestigation.
The foregoing request concerns facts of which the Soviet
Government must have the most direct, and therefore in a
judicial sense the best, available evidence. Should the
Soviet Government fail to favor the United States Gov-
ernment with the evidence requested, the United States
Government takes this opportunity to declare to the
Soviet Government that the United States Government
will in any future proceeding in which the evidence may
be relevant consider itself entitled to rely upon and sub-
mit other evidence in the United States Government‘s
possession, and reserves the right to consider and con-
tend wherever that may be relevant that the Soviet
Government should be estopped from relying upon or
oﬂering any of such evidence so requested by the United
States Government and not produced by the Soviet
Government.
Accept, Excellency, the renewed assurances of my high-
est consideration.
U.S. NOTE OF JANUARY 26
REGARDING IL-12 INCIDENT
EXCELLENCYZ The Embassy of the United States of
America presents its compliments to the Ministry for
Foreign Affairs of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
and, upon instructions from its Government, has the honor
to state the following:
The Government of the United States of America refers
to note No. 27/OSA of August 11, 1953, from the Govern-
ment of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in which
the Soviet Government requests the United States Govern-
ment to make payment of 7,445,800 rubles, or $1,861,450,
on account of damages alleged by the Soviet Government
to have been suffered by it in consequence of the destruc-
tion of an IL-12 airplane on July 27, 1953. As the United
States Government has indicated in related previous corre-
spondence with the Soviet Government, in a note of August
1, 1953,‘ replying to the Soviet Government note dated
July 31, 1953, the only incident in which any American
aircraft destroyed an IL-12 on July 27, 1953, occurred
entirely within North Korea, during a period of hostilities
° BULLETIN of Aug. 10, 1953, p. 179.
in which North Korea was a belligerent zone and the
aircraft destroyed was hostile.
In view, however, of the Soviet Government’s speciﬁcity
of allegations of fact in its note of August 11, 1953, and
of its request for compensation, the United States Govern-
ment has conducted a comprehensive and exhaustive in-
vestigation, not only to recheck the accuracy of the state-
ments made by the United States Government in the note
of August 1, replying to the Soviet Government's note of
July 31, to which reference has been made, but to check
so far as possible the accuracy of the various speciﬁc state
ments made in the Soviet Government's note of August 11,
1953, with respect to the Soviet Government's own ﬁndings
of fact.
The evidence derived from witnesses to Whom the
United States Government has access completely sustains
the conclusions set out in the United States Government's
note of August 1, 1953.
As the Soviet Government is well aware, investigation
of the character described as having been conducted by
Soviet authorities in Manchuria, or in North Korea, is
not as feasible for the United States Government as for
the Soviet Government. It is clear that a ﬁnal resolu-
tion of the issues of fact raised by the Soviet note of
August 11, 1953, cannot be reached, and the claim made
by the Soviet Government cannot be answered as fully
as the character of the claim would appear to merit, unless
the United States Government can obtain all evidence
relevant to the claim, and consider it as carefully and
exhaustively as it has the evidence which the United
States Government has obtained in its investigation.
The policy of the United States Government, as is well
known, is to further the settlement of international dis-
putes by the procedures of international law and order
and in accordance with the established practices of
diplomacy, and to encourage other governments to pursue
the same policy and practices in their relations with the
United States Government and among themselves. If
the applicable law and the established facts, upon the
issues raised by the exchanges of notes in this matter,
demonstrate that the United States Government is under
any obligation to the Soviet Government, the United
States Government is prepared to recognize and meet
that obligation in accordance with the established rules
of international law and the international practices com-
mon among peace-loving and law-abiding governments.
In consequence of the foregoing, the United States
Government, reserving its ﬁnal decision as to its liability,
if any, and the extent thereof, requests the Soviet Govern-
ment to supply the United States Government with the
following information which the Soviet Government has
indicated is in its possession or is available to it and
which is necessary in order that the United States Gov-
ernment may reach a determination of its own liability,
if any, to the Soviet Government in the premises.
A. With respect to the statements in the ﬁrst paragraph
of recitals of fact in each of the Soviet Government's
notes, that of July 31, 1953, and that of August 11, 1953,
the following particulars are requested:
1. The source of the statement in the note of July 31,
1953, that the number of American aircraft which at-
tacked the Soviet IL—12 was four, and the circumstances
under which the information was obtained. It is re-
quested particularly that it be stated on what date and
by what means this report was ﬁrst received by the SOViet
Government, and whether the witnesses making the
alleged identiﬁcation were ground witnesses or in the
air, and whether their observations were visual or made
by means of mechanical equipment.
2. The number of IL-12 type of aircraft of all kinds
belonging to the Soviet Government ﬂying in the area of
North Korea and the number ﬂying in the area of Man-
churia during July 27, 1953, and for seven days prior to
that date, and the circumstances of each such ﬂight. The
times included should comprise particularly the time of
the ﬁrst receipt by the Soviet Government of the news of
