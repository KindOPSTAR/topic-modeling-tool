United Nations Charter Review
Statement by Secretary Dulles 1
The United Nations Charter re resents man’s
most determined and promising e ort to save hu-
manity from the scourge of war and to establish
justice between the nations. In negotiating the
charter terms, the United States was represented
by a distinguished bipartisan delegation, largely
drawn from the Congress, and the charter was
ratiﬁed by the Senate by almost unanimous vote.
The United Nations, thus launched, carried the
ardent hopes of the American people, and indeed
the peoples of all the world. The responsible
leaders of our Nation, without regard to party,
have repeatedly said that the charter represents
the cornerstone of US. foreign policy.
It must in all frankness be recognized that the
high ho es born of the San Franclsco conference
of 1945 ave not been fully realized. This is due
to two principal causes.
In the ﬁrst place, many initial hopes were exag-
gerated. War is not abolished, and a system of
Justice inaugurated, merely by strokes of the pen.
If that were the case, we would have had inter-
national peace and justice long ago. Just and
durable peace requires sustained and well-directed
efforts com arable in dedication to the efforts
needed to Win victory in war.
However the written word continues to exert a
peculiar fascination, and there is a recurrent tend—
ency to treat as done that which, according to
a treaty, ought to be done. Hopes which had only
this basis were doomed to be disappointed.
In the second place, many provisions of the
charter depended on coo eration by the so-called
“great powers,” and in act the members of the
Soviet Communist bloc have pursued policies
which departed from the spirit, and indeed the
language, of the charter.
Nevertheless, the United Nations has a record
of cons icuous accomplishment. Among major
politica results which ﬂowed from its processes
may be mentioned:
lMade before the Charter Review Subcommittee of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Jan. 18 (press
release 19).
The withdrawal of Soviet forces from Iran;
The support of Greece while under Communist
attack;
The conclusion of a ermanent armistice be—
tween Israel and the Ara States;
The establishment of the Republic of Korea;
The disposition of the Italian colonies in Africa
and the creation of the State of Libya;
The establishment of the Republic of Indonesia;
The organization of effective resistance to the
armed aggression in Korea.
\Vhile the United States bore most of the United
Nations burden in Korea, it should not be forgot-
ten that 15 other members contributed armed
forces and 46 nations made some form of con-
tribution, either military or economic.
Thus, the United Nations became the ﬁrst inter-
national organization to organize effective collec—
tive resistance to armed aggression.
The United Nations has helped to transform
colonialism into self-government. The role
layed by the United Nations in this matter has
en controversial and it is in some respects sub-
ject to legitimate criticism. Undoubtedly, how-
ever, it has exerted a useful inﬂuence in promoting
peaceful rather than violent developments.
In addition to political achievements, the
United Nations has provided means for economic
and social developments which have beneﬁted a
large part of the human race.
In addition to its speciﬁc accomplishments, the
General Assembly has served as a world forum
for the presentation of different points of view.
It has become a place where world opinion can
register and exert a moral authority which no na-
tion, however powerful or despotic, publicly dis-
dains or wholly disregards.
The greatest weakness of the United Nations—
and this was foreseen at San Francisco—is the
Security Council’s inability to discharge its “pri-
mary responsibility for the maintenance of inter-
national peace and securit .” (article 24). It
has not proved practicable or the Security Coun-
cil to organize the armed forces, assistance, and
