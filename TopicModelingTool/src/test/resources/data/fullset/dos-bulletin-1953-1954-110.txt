GENERAL TI'IIMAYYA'S LETTER OF
JANUARY 14
I have the honor to refer to the commission’s
letter Nr N sac/Rnr/l dated 2nd January 1954‘
and your reply dated 6th January 1954.‘
1. As mentioned in the commission’s letter
dated 2nd January 1954, the NNRC has been able,
hitherto, to implement, only to a limited extent,
the procedures set out in the terms of reference.
2. The unrepatriated prisoners in the custod
of the commission include a number of PO 3
who have declined to exercise their right of re-
patriation. There are also a much larger number
who have not been able to avail themselves of the
procedures laid down in the terms of reference
and the rules made thereunder in regard to the
exercise, by the POWs, of their right of repatria-
tion.
3. The question of the disposition of POWs who
have not exercised their right to repatriation has
to be referred by the N NRC to the political con-
ference. Although such reference is mandatory,
it has not eventuated as the said political con-
ference has not materialized. Further, the ex-
planation procedures to which all prisoners are
entitled under the terms of reference and which
are enjoined on the commission have been carried
out only in res t of a small proportion of the
total of the P026; in custody.
4. These and other failures in respect of the
implementation of the terms of reference are due
to causes and factors which have not oriﬂ'inated
with the NNRC and the custodial force of India
and for which they bear no responsibility.
5. Further or fuller implementation by the com-
‘ Not printed.
mission of the rocedures and of the purposes of
the terms of re erence as from the date of the 24th
December 1953 was possible only by agreement
between or with the two commands in respect of
extension of the periods of ex lanation and
custody and with regard to such a temate or ex-
tended procedures as may have become necessary
by the failure of the political conference to
materialize.
6. The Nmrc has repeatedly made suggestions
and requests to the two commands in respect of
these matters. The facts of the situation confront-
ing the N NRC were, ﬁnally, set out at length in its
letter and annexed memorandum of 2 January.
7. In particular, the commission four
questions on matters which are basic to any fuller
implementation of the repatriation agreement by
the N NRC and requested your answers in respect
of them.
8. The NNRC has been favored with your re-
plies to each of these questions. Your answers
seek “to remove an possibility of doubt or mis-
understanding of I NC views" and have reiterated
“the ﬁrm sition” of the Use.
9. The NRC notes that the ﬁrm position of the
UNC in respect of each of the four matters is:
(a) That continuance of explanations is not
ible;
(b) That in the opinion of the Unc it is “ex-
tremely improbable that a political conference will
be in session rior to 22nd January”;
(0) That t e UNC sees no justiﬁcation for en-
tering into any discussion to consider the dispo-
sition of unrepatriate POle; and
(d) That the competence of the CFI [Custodian
Force, India] for holding POVVs in custody ceases
on the 23rd January 1954 at 0001 hours.
10. The above answer setting out the ﬁrm po-
sition of the Use places it be 'ond doubt that the
UNc is unable to a cc to the establishment of
conditions or proce( ures which are basic to and
without which the Nmzc cannot seek to implement
further procedures and purposes of the terms of
reference.
11. The NNRC has, therefore, to make its de
cision in the light of the existing situation and its
own appreciation of the terms and purposes of
the terms of reference and the responsrbilrties and
obligations arising therefrom.
