from outward celebrations on May 10th, it is cel-
. ebrated in their hearts as a symbol of their for-
titude and perseverance. It is my conviction that
this fortitude and perseverance, which has served
the Rumanian people so well during their entire
history, will continue to serve them until they can
recover their real independence of which they
were so justly proud.
U. S. Rejects Soviet Proposals for European Security
TEXT (IF U. 5. NOTE
Following is the tewt of a note delivered on
May 7 b the American Embassy at Moscow to the
Soviet Ministry of Foreign Aﬁairs in reply to
the Soviet note of March 31, 1954, concerning
European security:
Press release 236 dated May 7
The United States Government has consulted
the British and French Governments and the other
interested governments, and in articular those
of the North Atlantic Treaty rganization, on
those aspects of the problem of Euro can security
which were fully discussed by the our Foreign
Ministers at Berlin and to which the Soviet Gov-
ernment again drew attention in its note of
March 31.
The United States Government has long been
striving for the universal reduction of armaments,
to include the prohibition of atomic and other
weapons of mass destruction and the control of
atomic energy. In the United Nations Atomic
Energy Commission, the United Nations Commis-
sion on Conventional Armaments, and subse-
quently in the United Nations Disarmament Com-
mission, the United States Government has
worked to secure international agreement on dis-
armament and to put an end to the competition in
armaments which is imposing such a burden upon
the peoples of the world. Such a reement can
'only be reached b progressive and alanced dis-
armament with e ective safeguards which would
remove the dan ers of ag ession from any
quarter. The United States overnment is deter-
mined to do everything in its power to bring to
a successful conclusion the conversations started as
a result of President Eisenhower’s initiative as
well as the disarmament negotiations which will
shortly begin a ain in the United Nations. It
hopes that the oviet Government will make a
constructive contribution to the solution of these
problems.
If these negotiations are to succeed, a sense of
security and conﬁdence must ﬁrst be established.
It is in this light that the United States Govern-
ment has again carefully studied the Soviet pro-
gosals on European security ﬁrst ut forward in
erlin ‘ and now repeated 1n the oviet Govern-
ment’s note. In these the Soviet Government does
not attempt to remove the actual causes of Euro-
pean tension. Instead it proposes a new collective
security treaty which is avowedl based on the
neutralization and continued diviswn of Germany
while leavin unchanged the Soviet Government 5
close politica , economic and militar control over
the countries of Eastern Europe. This can only
prolong insecurity and division in Europe. These
proposals, even when amended to permit United
States participation, do not provide any founda-
tion for genuine security.
The addition to the United Nations of such an
organization as that re osed by the Soviet Gov-
ernment, embracing t e oviet Union, the United
States and all European countries would con-
tribute nothing to what is already a world-wide
security organization. It would not onl be use-
less but also dangerous because it would inevi-
tably tend to destroy the authority of the United
Nations. The United States Government can-
not therefore accept the Soviet proposal. Col-
lective security would best be safeguarded if the
Soviet Government would permit the United Na-
tions to function as the Charter intended.
The Soviet Government has also suggested that
its proposed Collective Security Pact should be
accompanied by an extension of the Atlantic Pact
through the adherence of the Soviet Union to the
North Atlantic Treaty. It is unnecessary to em-
phasize the completely unreal character of such
a suggestion. It is contrary to the very prin-
ciples on which the defense system and the security
of the Western Nations depend. These nations
have bound themselves by close ties of mutual
conﬁdence. The North Atlantic Treaty Organ-
ization, which is much more than a purely mili-
tary arrangement, is founded on the principle of
