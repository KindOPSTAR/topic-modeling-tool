come—our men returned to their homes in Idaho
and California and Texas and Massachusetts, some
no doubt to Norfolk, Va., and Norwich, Conn.
They returned with a deep admiration and a sin-
cere fondness for Great Britain and its peo 1e, and
garticularly for their hosts and friends Iiere in
orfolk.
Incidentally, I should like to take this oppor-
tunity to state that I have had a message from
Percy Young, current president of the Second Air
Division Association, who has asked me on behalf
of the Association to extend the most cordial and
continuing best wishes to all the members of this
community.
All of us had lived for the day of peace, and
many had died to help achieve it. When it came,
you and we went about our business, thinking that
never again could the world let itself be engulfed
in such cataclysmic events. But we did not reckon
with the surge of Communist imperialism. New
and ugly phrases became commonplace: Iron Cur-
tain, Berlin Blockade, Cold War, Slave Labor,
“People’s Democracies.” The Allies who had
given to the utmost to destroy the evils of fascism
now heard themselves branded as “Fascist aggres-
sors,” “imperialistic warmongers,” and other stock
phrases from the Communist collection of epithets.
U.S. Servleelnen Return
Not content with words, the Soviets became
daily more aggressive and more a deadly threat
to the peace of the world. In 1948 at the time of
the Berlin blockade, tension heightened. After
the closest consultation between our two Govern-
ments, American servicemen returned to the
United Kin dom at the invitation of your Gov-
ernment. irst, the great transports and cargo
carriers appeared at British bases. Then, as the
crisis seemed to mount, B-29 Superfortresses set
down at Marham Lakenheath, and Mildenhall—
combat ready. Later B—29s appeared at Scul-
thorpe, and the United States Air Force men re-
turned to Norwich, this time in Air Force blue but
still the same men or their younger brothers.
Royal Air Force stations were lent to theUnit/ed
States Air Force, and Strategic Air Command
began a rotational training program—an eco-
nomic scheme designed to provide top combat
proﬁciency tests to the heavy bomber crews, and
at the same time to make plain to the Communist
world that the United States and United King-
dom were united once again to resist a gression
and to do all in their power to reserve t e peace.
With the birth of the Nort Atlantic Treaty
Organization, the greatest coalition for peace the
world has ever seen, the relationships of our men
here changed. Britain extended its land facili-
ties to the U.S. Air Force, and in addition to the
bases lent for combat crew training, additional
bases were set aside for NATO-assigned aircraft.
Today, approximately one-ﬁfth of the 38,000
Americans stationed in Great Britain are assigned
to bases in or near East Anglia. Probably some-
times you must think all 38,000 are assigned ri ht
here in Norwich. It is entirely understanda le
that while we may be profoundly aware of the fact
that the international situation requires the main-
tenance of powerful United States air forces here
in Great Britain, at the same time the presence of
alien troops may occasionally become somewhat
irritating.
That is why earlier in this talk I spoke at some
length about the importance of the exchange-of-
persons principles. I realize fully that with so
many of our troops stationed here there are bound
to be some un leasant incidents, though in all fair-
ness I think 518113 have been remarkably few, and
those due more to unfamiliarity with the ways of
your country than to malice or evil intent. Yet,
if you can look on our boys as comrades engaged
in a common effort and realize that you and they
can most roﬁtably exchange knowledge, skills,
and outloo , I believe that you and they will ﬁnd
that their presence here has been rewarding in
many ways in addition to our common purpose
of defending the peace.
I realize that to a large degree I am preaching
to the converted, for in my conversations with
General Griswold,z Commander of our Third Air
Force, and with Brigadier General Stevenson,“
and other ofﬁcers here, I have learned that the
American personnel stationed in the United King-
dom—and it goes without saying those stationed
in East Anglia—have no more community-rela-
tions problems here than they would at our bases
at home. That, I believe, constitutes a highly
satisfactory measure of the strength of the British-
American alliance. If I may say so, I am very
proud of this record of ours.
Brltlsh Hospltallty
On behalf of my country I would like to thank
you for the splendid effort you of Norwich have
made toward extending hospitality and wholesome
recreation for our young airmen. For example,
I understand that the Women’s Voluntary Service
operates an Anglo-American Club in Colegate
which only recently celebrated its second birth-
day. Nothing could be more helpful than a wide
extension of this sort of voluntary effort.
A scheme of greater scope, led by Air Chief
Marshal Sir George Pirie, is one in which I have
a very deep interest, for it ties in closely with my
remarks on the values of the exchange program.
Brieﬂy, Sir George and his associates are working
with local groups interested in bringing together
America-n service people and British of like back-
