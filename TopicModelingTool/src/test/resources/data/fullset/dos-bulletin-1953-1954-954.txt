LETTER FROM SECRETARY DULLES T0
DR. WRISTONl
Press release 322 dated June 15
JUNE 15, 1954
DEAR DR. Warsrorv: I have received and care-
fully studied the report of the Public Committee
on Personnel transmitted by your letter of May 18.
At my instruction, the report has been printed
and is being released today.2
I should like to commend the Committee for
the thorough and penetrating manner in which
its public-spirited members, under your able
chairmanship, have dealt with the very difﬁcult
personnel and administrative roblems of the De-
partment of State. It was t e complexity and
vital importance of these problems, most of which
have been recognized—but left unsolved—for some
years, that persuaded me to seek appropriate cor-
rective recommendations from this group of out-
standing private citizens.
I felt that this study could not be attempted
while the Department and Foreign Service were
undergoing the dislocations of the reduction-in-
force necessitated by budgetary restrictions. TVith
that obstacle passed, we could proceed. Accord-
ingly, I share the view of the Committee that now
is the time for action.
I have been particularly concerned that the pro-
fessional service, which bears the responsibility
for carrying out the vastly intricate business of

the Department and Foreign Service concerning the

foreign affairs, has not expanded and broadened
to meet the growing demands of today in the
manner envisioned by the Congress when it passed
the Foreign Service Act of 1946. I am, therefore,
particularly pleased that the Committee’s recom-
mendations not only embody an immediate pro-
gram for strengthening this service, but also
provide a long-range method of maintaining that
essential strength.
As a ﬁrst and fundamental step, I have today
recommended, and the President has agreed to,
the nomination of Mr. Charles E. Saltzman as
Under Secretary of State for Administration.
Mr. Saltzman, who served as one of the members
of the Public Committee, is also a former Assist-
ant Secretary of State. He will have the duty
of initiating and directing the execution of this
new program. Under my supervision he will also
be in complete charge of the administrative of-
ﬁces and o erations of the Department, and will,
of course, ave my full support in carrying out
his mission.
Mr. Thruston Morton, with exceptional ability
and devotion to public service, has been carrying
the additional job of Acting Deputy Under Sec-
retary for Administration. Mr. Saltzman’s ap-
pointment will enable Mr. Morton once again to
devote full time to his duties as Assistant Secre-
ta for Congressional Relations. I am grateful
torhim for the administrative leadership he has
provided during the interim period while the
Committee was formulating its recommendations.
Mr. Saltzman believes, and I concur, that this
new program can be fully launched and well un-
derway by December 31, 1954, at which time the
statutory authority for the osition of Under
Secretary of State for Admmistration expires,
and at which time Mr. Saltzman intends to return
to his business, from which he is taking a leave of
absence.
I heartily endorse the two key recommendations
made by the Committee:
A. Integration of the personnel of the Depart-
mental home service and the Foreign Service
where their functions and responsibilities con-
verge.
B. The bold and imaginative recruitment and
scholarship program whereby the Foreign Service
