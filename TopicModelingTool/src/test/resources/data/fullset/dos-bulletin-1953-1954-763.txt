General Strike in Honduras
Press release 242 dated May 11
At his news conference on Ma 11, Secretary
Dulles was asked for comment on t e general strike
in Honduras and any relation it had to Guatemala.
M r. Dulles made the following reply:
The indications are that the so-called strike in
Honduras is not entirely a domestic phenomenon.
There is at least an interesting coincidence in the
fact that the strikes have occurred principally in
an area to which the Guatemalan Government re-
cently sent three consuls who have subsequently
been declared persona non grata by the Govern-
ment of Honduras because of their activities.
Bipartisan Foreign Policy
Press release 243 dated May 11
At his news con erencc on May 11, Secretary
Dulles was asked w ther in his opinion bipartisan
foreign policy had deteriorated over the past year
and whether he felt that any Democrat had been
given anything like the authority that he was given
as a representative of the ogposition party in the
Truman administration. r. Dulles replied as
follows:
I myself am not conscious of any deterioration
of bipartisanship in foreign policy. I have had
the most frequent and intimate talks with both
Re ublican and Democratic members of Congress,
bot in the Senate and the House. I have always
been received and listened to with the eatest
courtesy by Democrats as well as Republicans.
I have nothing but satisfaction in my own mind
for the degree in which there has up to the present
time been a nonpartisan approach to this question
of forei policy, and I hope it will continue that
way. ertainly, I shall do everything within my
power to make it continue that way.
There is no point in disguising the fact that we
have been and are and for a long time will be faced
by the greatest danger, I think, that has ever con-
fronted our Nation, and I think it is indispensable
that there should be bipartisanship. I showed
that myself when the Democrats were in charge
of the executive department of the Government
and did all that I could to contribute toward it,
working principally, of course, with Senator Van-
denberg and Governor Dewey, and in that we
we had a united front with which to face the worl .
I am doin all that I can to contribute to making
that possi 1e at the present time, and so far I
have received, and I expect to continue to receive,
cooperation on the part of the Democrats.
It is often, I think, forgotten that David
Bruce, who was the Under Secretary of State when
we came in, continues on in the same capacity in
relation to this administration that I had in re-
lation to the Truman administration. He is a
trusted adviser in relation to many of the most
important aspects of our foreign policy.
