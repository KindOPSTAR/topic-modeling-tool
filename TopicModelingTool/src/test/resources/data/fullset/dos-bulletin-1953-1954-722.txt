maintenance of world peace, to obtain such agreements.
As far as the Soviet Union is concerned it will continue
to insist that a substantial reduction in the arms and
armed forces of the countries is necessary and that an
agreement must be reached to rule out the employment of
atomic energy for destruction and the wholesale annihila-
tion of human beings.
The signiﬁcance of such efforts on the part of the coun-
tries is growing ever greater, especially since the destruc-
tive power of atomic weapons is constantly increasing and,
more than that, there have appeared hydrogen weapons
which are many times more powerful than atomic weapons.
There can be no doubt that the employment of atomic
and hydrogen weapons in a war would bring the peoples
untold suitering.
It would mean the wholesale annihilation of civilians
and the destruction of big cities, the centers of present-day
industry, culture, and science, including such old centers
of civilization as the leading capitals of the world.
In observing corresponding efforts to make it easier to
reach agreement on these major problems, the Soviet Gov-
ernment also is acting on the belief that there are other,
as yet unutilized, opportunities for building up peace.
First of all, the signiﬁcance of strengthening security
in Europe should be noted, inasmuch as the maintenance
of peace in Europe is decisively important if general peace
is to be maintained and a new world war prevented.
With this in view, the Soviet Government put a pro-
posal to guarantee security in Europe before the Berlin
meeting of French, British, United States, and Soviet
foreign ministers and, in this connection, submitted a
draft of the fundamentals of a general European treaty
for collective security in Europe.
The draft provides for a general European system of
security based on the collective efforts of all the countries
of Europe.
All the European countries, irrespective of social sys-
tems, can be participants. This includes Germany.
Moreover, pending the integration of Germany, the
German Democratic Republic and the German Federal
Republic could be signatories to the treaty.
In the case of an armed attack on any one of the signa-
tories, the treaty stipulates that the attacked country
shall be assisted by every possible means, including the
use of armed force, to restore and maintain international
peace and security in Europe.
Consequently, the draft proposals for a general Euro-
pean treaty are intended to establish an effective system
of collective security in Europe in accordance with the
principles of the United Nations Charter.
The creation of a general European system of collective
security would put an end to the formation in Europe of
antagonistic military groups of countries.
The establishment of such groups invariably tends to
aggravate relations between countries and increase hostil-
ity and distrust, to say nothing of the fact that it is at-
tended by an arms drive with all the resulting conse-
quences for the people.
It should also be borne in mind that the creation of
one military group of countries invariably precipitates
corresponding action on the part of other countries to
guarantee their security.
As a result, there arises a situation in which relations
between countries are based not on a desire for mutual
cooperation in the interests of keeping peace, but on such
an elf-setting of each other as inevitably increases the
strain in relations between countries and thereby height-
ens the menace of another war.
It must not be overlooked that both the First and Sec-
ond World Wars were preceded by the establishment of
antagonistic military groups of countries and the split-
ting of Europe into two hostile camps.
Nor must we forget the particularly dangerous role of
German militarism in such military groups and in pro-
voking the First and Second World Wars.
All this underscores how important it is to offset the
policy of forming antagonistic military groups of coun-
tries with a policy of effective cooperation on the part of
all the European countries for the sake of maintaining
and promoting peace.
Such cooperation between all the EurOpean countries,
large and small, irrespective of social systems, would
make it possible to avoid a situation in which Europe
is periodically embroiled in devastating wars as the his-
tory of the European countries for the last 100 years
shows.
It is for this reason that the Soviet Government time
and time again has called the attention of the United
States Government as well as the British and French
Governments to the danger inherent in the formation
of military groups of countries.
For one, the Soviet Government has drawn attention
to this in view of the plans to form what is called the
European Defense Community, plans that lead to the
restoration of German militarism with all the resulting
dangerous consequences for peace in Europe, especially
for the security of West Germany’s neighbors.
The plans to form a European Defense Community, it
is known, stipulate the establishment of a closed military
group of six European countries behind the screen of
which a so-called European army, comprising the armed
forces of France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxem-
bourg, and West Germany, too, would be organized.
The main role in this European army is assigned to
the armed forces of West Germany with Nazi generals
at the head. This conﬂicts with the commitments as-
sumed by France, Britain, and the United States together
with the Soviet Union not to permit a resurgence of
German militarism.
What is more, there are already plans on foot to es-
tablish several dozen West German divisions.
It is also well-known that in view of the plans to
organize a European army, the ruling quarters of West
Germany are openly working to speed the remilitarization
of West Germany and to form regular armed forces of
all kinds and no longer ﬁnd it necessary to conceal their
aggressive aims with respect to neighboring countries.
For this reason the peace-minded nations of Europe,
especially West Germany‘s neighbors, cannot but feel
a legitimate anxiety for their security, in view of the
danger stemming from a reviving German militarism
and the incorporation of West Germany in a European
Defense Community.
Reviving German militarism and forming military
groups in Europe, far from promoting peace, means pav-
ing the way for another war.
Yet today, more than ever before, all the peace-minded
countries, and above all the big powers, should direct
their efforts to preventing a new war and to seeing that
the peoples of Europe—including the Germans—are not
involved in another war, which in present conditions is
particularly dangerous for the nations.
This can be successfully achieved if instead of antag-
onistic military groups of European countries, there is
created a system of security based on the common efforts
of all the European countries.
At the same time the establishment of such a system
of collective security in Europe would promote a general
peace. This is the very reason why the idea of collective
security in Europe, especially since the Berlin meeting,
commands the energetic support of a number of countries,
as well as of large international forces.
When the Soviet proposal to conclude a general Euro-
pean treaty was examined at the Berlin meeting, there
proved to be divergencies which made it impossible to
reach agreement.
However, in view of the importance of reaching the
proper agreement on this major issue the Soviet Govern-
ment feels it would be expedient to continue discussion
of the proposal.
In connection with the examination of the Soviet pro-
posal to guarantee collective security in Eur0pe, the
opinion has been voiced that it is undesirable that the
