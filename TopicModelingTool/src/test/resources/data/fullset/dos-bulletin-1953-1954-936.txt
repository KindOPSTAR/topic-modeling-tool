di utes between Israel and the Arab States in
Pa estine. While there certainly is no ﬁnal peace
agreed upon as yet in this area, the armistice is
still honored in large measure.
The Kashmir dispute between India and Paki-
stan also has not been ﬁnally settled. However
Security Council efforts, in which the Uni
States has played a major role, have brought about
a cease-ﬁre and agreement between the parties on
many elements of this dispute. I mi ht also men-
tion the Berlin blockade, an extreme y dangerous
situation involving the Great Powers and the pres-
tige of both the Soviet Union and the United
States, which was settled by peaceful negotiations
begun through United Nations channels after the
Western Powers had demonstrated their ﬁrm in-
tent to maintain their commitments to the free
people of Berlin.
Not least in the evidence of our devotion to the
concept of peaceful settlement is the long history
of the efforts to settle the Korean problem peace-
fully. We Americans are often accused of being
an impatient e0 le. Yet, I believe that history
will record With avor our patient negotiation on
the Korean problem in the face of Communist
delay, viliﬁcation, and false accusation.
Striking at the Root Causes of War
The second major element in our foreign policy
has been to support action striking at the root
causes of world unrest. Through our own direct
aid and through our support of United Nations
efforts we are helping to save people, to save mate—
rial resources, to develop skills, to alleviate the so-
cial and economic ills which provide a fertile
breeding ground for world unrest and for com-
munism and other similar reactionary doctrines.
Between mid-1945 and December 31, 1953, for non-
milita purposes the United States actually
grante approximately $26 billion and loaned
about $13 billion for foreign aid in man parts of
the world. This money was used to re uild war
devastated areas, to restore and raise industrial
and agricultural levels, to arrest the spread of dis-
ease, to develop skills, to bring foreign leaders and
students to this country and send our own experts
abroad for mutual beneﬁt. This expenditure does
not include our support of the ﬁnancially inexpen-
sive but amazin ly successful programs conducted
by the United ations in the economic and social
ﬁeld on a cooperative basis, through the United
Nations Technical Assistance programs and the
efforts of the specialized agencies, to which the
United States is the chief contributor.
These efforts are in our self-interest. They are
helping to create worldwide stability. Wide-
spread disease, serious economic ills, and major
social unrest in any part of the world inevitably
affect our own peace, security, and well-being. We
cannot be an oasis of prosperity in a world of mis-
ery. We must strive to remove conditions which
984
permit the Communists to exploit misery and
want. Our security involves not only military
ower but also the good will and res ect, the con-
dence, and the moral support of ecent people
anywhere in the world. As we help to improve the
general welfare of people, we are givmg them
something to ﬁght with and ﬁght for.
Collective Security
When most people talk about collective securit
they think in terms of military pacts. While
have indicated earlier that in fact security is com-
pounded of many elements, the military element
is a fundamental in maintaining our freedom.
Let me remind you of how Secretary Dulles re-
cently stated the importance of collective security
to the United States:
The cornerstone of security for the free nations must be
a collective system of defense. They clearly cannot achieve
security separately. No single nation can develop for it-
self defensive power of adequate scope and ﬂexibility. In
seeking to do so, each would become a garrison state and
none would achieve security.‘
The United States participates in two types of
collective security arrangements. The ﬁrst t e
is the United Nations s stem. The United a-
tions Charter contemp ated that the Security
Council would have primary responsibility for the
maintenance of international eace and security.
The attitude of the Soviet nion soon demon-
strated that the collective security function could
not be based on continuing cooperation by the
Five Great Powers. Soviet intransigence on the
problem of making forces available to the U.N.
in accordance with article 43 of the charter and
the specter of Soviet use of its veto power to pre-
vent any eifective collective security action brought
about the “Unitin for Peace” resolution of No-
vember 3, 1950. his resolution provides that
the General Assembly can meet in emergency ses-
sion within 24 hours if the Security Council, be-
cause of lack of unanimity of the ﬁve permanent
members, fails to act when the peace is threatened
or broken. The General Assembly can then make
recommendations to members of the United Na-
tions to take necessary action, including the use
of armed force.
The Uniting for Peace resolution also estab-
lished a Peace Observation Commission to observe
and report on the situation in any area in which
international conﬂict threatens, upon the invita-
tion or with the consent of the state in whose terri-
tory the Commission would go. The Thai Gov-
ernment on June 3 requested just such a Peace
Observation group for its area.
Article 51 of the charter recognizes the right of
individual or collective self-defense to meet armed
attack. It requires only that the measures taken
in the exercise of this right of self-defense be im-
