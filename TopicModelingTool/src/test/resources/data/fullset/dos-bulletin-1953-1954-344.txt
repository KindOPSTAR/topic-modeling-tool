Our Forelgn Pollcy In Today’s World
by Thruston B. Morton
Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relationsl
When Mr. Elicker ’ asked me to be resent this
evening, he said that it was the deswe of our
ﬁoup to know more about the policies 0 the
partment of State . . . “So that they can give
every possible cooperation to you and to the
ofﬁcials of our Government.”
That was an invitation I could not refuse. We,
the ofﬁcials of your Government, need your co-
operation. The success of the policies we are
pursuing depends upon the support given us by
the American people.
We cannot ex t support, however, unless those
policies are un erstood. In a democracy we see
support without understanding as worthless. The
two must 0 together.
From t is roup, understanding can be taken
for granted. ut you can be of inestimable serv-
ice to us, and to your country, if you would spread
that understanding. Especially at this time.
I say “at this time” because today the foreign
policies of our country are undergoin certain
changes. The are, to use a phrase em 0 ed b
Secretary Dul es, being 'ven a “new 00k.” l’t:
is important that these ciglnges be understood.
Perhaps “chan ” isn’t exactly the right word.
This “new look’ is, rather, a development—an
evolution. There have been developments in the
world situation, and we are adjusting to them.
The basic objective of our policies, of course,
remains the same. It is, as it has always been
throughout our histo , the security and welfare
of the people of the nited States.
The promotion of that objective is the duty of
all Government departments and of all Govern-
ment ofﬁcials It is the duty of all Americans.
Consistently, over the years, the attainment of
that objective has called, from time to time, for
a reexamination of our policies and the programs
designed to put them into effect. Both have had
to be adjusted continually to meet changing
conditions.
‘Address made before the National Association of Sec-
ondary School Principals at Milwaukee, Wis, Feb. 20
(press release 79 dated Feb. 19).
'Paul E. Elicker, EXPcntive Secretary, National Asso-
ciation of Secondary School Principals.
The “new look” given U. S. foreign policies to-
ga)? tailors them to meet conditions as they are
ay.
By and large, these new policies have been made
possible by t ose that have preceded them. The
world situation that we face today is the result of
what steps we have taken in the past.
Let me mention a few such steps brieﬂy: (1)
aid to Greece and Turkeg, which checked the Com-
munist drive to the Iediterranean; (2) the
European recovery program, which ut our
friends and allies of “'estern Europe ack on
their feet after World War II; (3) the buildup
of free-world defenses under NATO and the other
defense programs; and (4) the action taken in
Korea.
The im
rtance of these policies can be best
estimated if we try to
icture where we, and the
world, would be today ad thev not been ado ted.
If, in other words, (11‘9608 and Turkey had an
permitted to slip behind the Iron Curtain, lost
to the free world and added to slave-world
strength. If the free nations of Europe had been
left to ﬂounder unaided in the political and eco-
nomic morass that followed World “'ar II. If
we had permitted our own, and free world, mili-
tary strength to further deteriorate until we had
been helpless before the massed might of the
Communists. If the aggression against Korea
had gone unchecked.
None of these thin happened. We took steps
to prevent them, an the policies and programs
we adopted worked. The overall danger that in-
voked those licies, however, remains today
unchanged. he threat of Soviet imperialism is
still the 'm menace that it has been since the
end of orld War II. And, as far as we can
see, there is no early prospect of change.
The problem confrontin us now is handling
this danger on a long-term asis.
Ila-Illustmcnts for the Long Pull
That problem calls for readjustments in our
policies. It calls for new programs to ﬁt those
policies.
This “new look” is the answer.
