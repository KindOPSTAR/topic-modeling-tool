SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL POINTS
The notes exchanged between the United States
and Mexican Governments in Mexico City on
March 10 renewed the Migrant Labor Agreement
of 1951 until December 31, 1955. They also clari-
ﬁed the agreement and brought about certain
changes which were mutually deemed necessary to
improve the operation of the agreement and to
reduce the ﬂow of illegal workers into the United
States. Principal provisions of the new under-
standing are as follows:
1. Wages paid to Mexican workers in the United
States under the agreement may not be less than
the prevailing wages for domestic laborers per-
forming the same activity in the same area of
employment as determined by the United States
Secretary of Labor. Provision is made for the
Mexican Government to protest and present evi-
dence where it believes the wage determination to
be inaccurate.
2. The contracting of workers will not be in-
terrupted during investigation and solution of
differences which might arise in connection with
the operation of the program.
3. Subsistence allowances for Mexican workers
are to be established at rates adequate to meet the
cost in the area of employment of diets which
the United States Department of Agriculture con-
?icllgrs necessary for persons performing arduous
a r.
4. Oﬁ-the-job insurance at the workers’ expense
is provided to cover workers suffering injuries,
illnesses or death. Standard form policies will be
established which may be underwritten b any
properly licensed insurance company 0 ering
competitive rates. The Mexican Government re-
serves the right to institute a plan for oil-the-job
insurance to be managed by a. Mexican Govern-
ment authorized organization.
5. Entire counties will no longer be included in
the list of areas which are unacceptable for the
employment of Mexican labor because of discrimi-
nation in a articular community. Individual
employers wi 1 be placed on ineligible lists only
as a result of joint determination by both Gov-
ernments.
6. Workers who do not complete their contracts
will receive return transportation and subsistence
costs from the em loyer in the same proportion
as the period worged compares with the length
of the contract. Emplo ers may postpone from
one pay day to the imme iater following pay day
a total of three days earnings of a worker.
7. A new mi tory station for the recruitment
of workers wil be opened at Mexicali, Baja Cali-
fornia, and the stations at Monterrey and Chi-
huahua are to be reactivated. The other migratory
stations provided in the agreement are at Durango,
Irapuato, and Guadalajara. A U. S. reception
center at Hidalgo is lanned to replace that for-
merly at Harlingen, exas.
8. lVorkers who were contracted in the United
States during the period from January 16, 1954,
to February 8, 1954, may, if they desire, be covered
at the ex iration of their contracts by new con-
tracts un er the renewed a cement.
9. A Joint Migratory La or Commission com-
posed of re resentatives of the interested Depart-
ments of the two Governments has been estab-
lished to function until October 31, 1954. This
commission will observe the migrant labor move-
ment between Mexico and the United States in
both its legal and illegal aspects and make recom-
mendations to the two Governments for possible
improvement in the operation of the agreement
and for methods of deterring the illegal trafﬁc.
The Commission will also study the advisability of
reducing the minimum contracting period for
Mexican workers from six to four weeks and make
appropriate recommendations within thirty days.
The Commission will also study and make recom-
mendations concerning other problems which are
referred to it by the Governments.
10. New negotiations may be entered into with-
in 30 days after the ﬁnal recommendations of the
Joint Commission in order that the Governments
may consider applying these recommendations to
the operation of the program.
