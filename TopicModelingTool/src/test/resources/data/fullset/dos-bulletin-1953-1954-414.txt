struggling to establish the basis of our Union, and
that struggle with its intercolony rivalries, jeal-
ousies and purely local tenacity to retain cherished
prerogatives had much in common with your own
istory of the stirring time of William the Silent.
The energies of our new Nation were devoted to
consolidating the principles which brou ht it into
being. Throughout the 19th century tie young
Republic was occupied with the opening of a vast
continent, expanSion westward, develo ment of
natural resources and adjustment to t e many
changes of our industrial era. But during this
period it would be unjust to say we abdicated our
responsibilities as a member of the international
community or that we sheltered behind a Chinese
wall of isolation. We did not keep traders from
acros the seas conﬁned to a tiny mud island as
happened to that hardy handful of merchants
from your country in their patient, successful siege
to keep open commerce With Japan for over 200
gears, from 1641 to 1858. Indeed we drew from
urope in those years thousands who aided and
shared in our growth as a nation.
Growth and Responsibility
During the First World War the United States
had become sufﬁciently stron , suiliciently sure of
itself, to share the responsibi ities of membership
in a rapidly chan in world order. Obviously,
however, a change in t ie thinking of a democratic
nation cannot be accomplished overnight. After
that war, carried alon by the nostalgic u surge
of the popular deman “to return to norma cy”—
as the slogan went—opponents of the Lea e of
Nations were able to prevent our members ip in
it. But realization and reco ition of our multi-
lateral interests gradually awned on our con-
sciousness during the next decade. When the
Nazis began their tragic and devastating onslaught
the American people had no doubt where its in-
terests lay or of the direction its Government must
take. The human desire to avoid involvement in
a bloody and distant struggle slowly gave way to
the knowledge that all that we cherished was at
stake, and Pearl Harbor crystallized our united
stand to make war till victory was complete. The
history of that period and of our efforts jointly
with our Allies to establish that great institution,
the United Nations, is familiar to you all.
Basic to an understanding of why we believe
that mutual respect and conﬁdence between na-
tions is so vital, is an understanding of the Amer-
ican character. A vivid description of an Amer-
ican was written in 1782 by that keen observer of
American life, Hector St. John Crevecoeur. Let
me read it:
What then is the American, this new man? He is
either an European, or the descendant of an European,
hence that strange mixture of blood, which you find in
no other country. . I could point out to you a fam-
ily whose grandfather was an Englishman, whose wife
was Dutch, whose son married a French woman and
whose present four sons have now tour wives of different
nations. He is an American, who, leaving behind him
all his ancient prejudices and manners, receives new ones
from the new mode of life he has embraced, the new
government he obeys, and the new rank he holds.
Thus, b reason of our diverse origins, as early
as 17 82 a istinctive American character was being
formed. It is well to recall in this connection the
prominent part that religion and things of the
s )irit have played in the formation of our na-
tional character and our Nation. With few excep~
tions the original Thirteen Colonies were founded
by individuals seeking freedom of worship. To
my knowledge no other country has had such a
basic spiritual compulsion for its foundation. To
this religious inﬂuence was added the stirring
precepts of 18th century enlightenment—the con-
cept of the free individual, the inherent dignity
of man—as a basis for our society and govern-
ment. These two inﬂuences are as fundamental
to the American character today as the were in
1776. They account, I think, in no smal measure,
for the “idealism” which has been characteristic
of our country. We do believe that the world
can be made better; we do believe that the God-
given rights of freedom, justice, and equality of
opportunity are truths against which the actions
0 a nation must be judged.
This moral and idealistic approach to our own
problems has direct bearing and inﬂuence upon
our relations with other governments. Though
sometimes our motivations are blurred by what
must seem to Europeans as excessive im atience,
naiveté, or disregard for history, and wiliile our
actions sometimes may appear overly moralistic,
they are usually based to a greater or lesser de-
ee on our beliefs in the spiritual character and
ignity of the human being and his relationshi
to the State. It is, therefore, a logical outgrowth
of our whole philosophy of life to recognize the
hopes and deSires, the rights and voices of other
nations when we embark on any great venture.
Today we have embarked on the greatest venture
of our history—the world struggle to maintain
freedom.
We are fortunate in havinv ﬁrm friends, you
among them, who share those Ibeliefs.

It is an interesting paradox that by its actions
the Soviet regime has strengthened the moral and
spiritual ties we have with other countries. Those
actions have brought us closer to other nations,
who, with ourselves, cannot, could never, agree
with the main tenets of communism or the ruth-
less methods of their enforcement.
