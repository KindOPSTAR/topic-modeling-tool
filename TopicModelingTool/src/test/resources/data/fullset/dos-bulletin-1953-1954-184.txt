abroad—by means of a rate reduction, a foreign
tax credit, or some other device—preferential tax
treatment comparable to that already recom-
mended for corporate investors.
(2) Removal of Certain Henri/tions on Foreign
T aw Credits.
The Commission recommends that the Congress
remove several restrictions which now prevent a
peison who invests abroad from offsetting in full
against his domestic tax the appropriate foreign
taxes.
(a) Under present law a United States corpora-
tion owning 10 percent or more of the voting stock
of a foreign corporation may credit against its
United States tax on the dividends received from
the foreign corporation a proportionate share of
the foreign income taxes aid by the foreign cor-
ration on the earnings rom which the dividend
was distributed. This 10 (percent ownership re-
guirement should be reduce or eliminated if satis-
actory administrative standards can be devised
for dealing with smaller holdings. Provision
should be made for the investment trusts, not only
to receive, but to pass on to the individual share-
holder the credit for foreign taxes available to
individual investors.
(b) The foreign tax credits are also limited to
income taxes and to taxes in lieu of a tax on in-
come. This requirement that the foreign country
have a general income tax to which the investor
would be subject in the absence of a special pro-
vision applicable to him has clearly been too re-
strictive. The interpretation of what taxes are in
lieu of income taxes should be liberalized in this
and other respects.
(0) The Commission recommends further that
the ‘ over-all” limitation on foreign tax credits be
eliminated.
(J) The Choice of Farm of Investment Abroad.
In the view of the Commission, United States
tax law should not penalize investors for adopting
the form of or nization dictated by local laws or
business conditions abroad. In order to reduce the
possibility of such penalties the Commission rec-
ommends that a United States corporation be al-
lowed the option of treating any direct foreign
investment either as a branch or a subsidiary for
United States tax purposes, regardless of which of
the two forms of organization is actually chosen
for operations abroad. The choice of treatment
for tax pu es should be binding, however, un-
til for g cause the United States Treasury
allows a change.
GOVERNMENT GUARANTY OF PRIVATE
INVBTMENT AIROAD
The Commission therefore recommends that the
n-ogram of guaranties against expropriation or
inconvertibility of exchange be given a further
period of trial and that during this period guar-
ant coverage on a discretiona basis he author-
12H for the risks of war, revo ution, and wear-
rection on new investments abroad.
Problems ot Agriculture and Raw Materials
CONFLICT IETWEEN FARM POLICIB ANO
ENLARGE-INT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE
In the opinion of the Commission, it is necessary
to harmonize our agricultural and foreign eco-
nomic policies without sacriﬁcing the sound 0b-
jectives of either.
STEPS TOWARD RECONCILIATION OF PAR.
AND TRADE POLICIES
The Commission recommends that during the
life of the 1953 International Wheat Agreement
its operation be kept under critical review, that
efforts be made to make the organization contribute
its maximum to solving ressing problems, and
that its termination in 195gbe given consideration.
In the application of import. restrictions on farm
products, the level of those restrictions should be
set with full regard for the effects on overseas
buying power and the ibility that such restric-
tions may lead to rate iation and may be self-de-
feating.
The Commission believes that a. dynamic foreign
economic poli as it relates to agriculture cannot
be built out o a maze of restrictive devices such
as inﬂexible price-support programs which result
in ﬁxed prices, 0 n or concealed export subsidies,
import quotas at ome and abroad, excessive use of
tariffs here and abroad, exchange restrictions, and
state trading. If we are to have a foreign eco-
nomic policy which will make its best contribution
to the strengthening of our long-term develop-
ment of foreign markets for farmers, we must
move as rapidly as feasible toward the elimination
of such devices as a art of, or supplement to, our
own agricultural p0 icy.
“STAIle OF RAW IATIRIALS PRICES
The Commission does not believe that extensive
resort to commodity a cements will solve the
problem of price instability; and it believes that
such agreements introduce rigidities and restraints
that impair the elasticit of economic adjustment
and the freedom of in ividual initiative, which
are fundamental to economic pro
The Commission ﬁnds the same objections to
the ro is for unilateral buﬂ'er stock action by
the nited States to stabilize world prices of raw
materials and foodstuffs.
The Commission believes that the constructive
contributions that the U. S. Government can make
toward greater stability of world prices are:
(1) measures tending to relax or remove imped-
iments to United States foreign trade and to en-
courage other countries to move in the same
direction;
