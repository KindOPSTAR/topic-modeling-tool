That United States position was made clear at
the recent Berlin conference. There, by standing
ﬁrm, I ﬁnally obtained the reluctant agreement
by Mr. Molotov that the Geneva conference would
not be a “Big Five Conference” and that the invi-
tation to Geneva would itself speci that neither
the invitation to, nor the holdin o , that confer-
ence should be deemed to impl diplomatic recog-
nition where it had not alrea y been accorded.
The Chinese Communist re ime has been invited
only to discuss Korea and In ochina, where it is in
fact a force of aggression which we cannot ignore.
It gets no diplomatic recognition from us by the
fact of its presence at Geneva. I said at Berlin:
“It is . . . one thing to recognize evil as a fact.
It is another thing to take evil to one’s breast and
call it good.” That we shall not do.
The Dangers Ahead
The United States delegation will go to Geneva
in an effort to bring about a united and independ-
ent Korea, from which Communist China will
have withdrawn its army of invasion. Also, we
hope that any Indochina discussion will serve to
bring the Chinese Communists to see the danger
of their apparent design for the conquest of South-
east Asia, so that they will cease and desist. We
shall not, however, be disposed to give Communist
China what it wants from us, merely to buy its
promises of future good behavior.
Some, perhaps, would have it otherwise. But
we dare not forget that during the period when
we accepted Communist promises _at their face
value, and took for granted their peaceful inten-
tions, the danger steadily rew.
IVe can, I think take a esson from Dien-Bien-
Phu. For some days there has seemed to be a.
lull. But in fact the danger has steadily mounted
The enemy sappers have never ceased their work.
They have burrowed and tunneled to gain forward
ositions so that the inner citadels can be sub
]ected to mass assault from close positions.
Today the free world also feels a sense of lull.
The danger of general war seems to have receded.
I hope that that is so. If it is so, it is because the
free nations saw the danger and moved unitedly,
with courage and decision, to meet it.
There is, however, no reason for assuming that
the danger has ermanently passed. There is
nothing to prove t at the Soviet Communist rulers
acce t peace as permanent, if ermanent peace
would block their ambitions. ey continue un-
ceasingly to burrow and tunnel to advance their
positions against the citadels of freedom.
In Europe, Soviet Russia holds its grip on
Eastern Germany and Austria and maneuvers
recklessly to prevent reconciliation between
France and German . In Asia, the whole area
from Ja an and orea to Southeast Asia is
troubled y Communist efforts at penetration.
As against such efforts, there is only one do-
fense—eternal vigilance, sound policies, and high
courage.
The United States is a member of a goodly com-
any who in the ast have stood together in the
ace of great peri and have overcome it. If we
are true to that past, we can face the future with
hope and conﬁdence.
Tribute to Commander and Men
of DIen-Blen-Phu Garrison
President Eisenhower on March 28 sent the fol-
lowing message to Rene Uoty, President of France:

lions of my countrymen, I salute the gallantry and
