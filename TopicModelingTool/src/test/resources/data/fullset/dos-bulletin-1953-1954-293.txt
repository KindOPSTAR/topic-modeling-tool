data” can be removed from the statutory “re-
stricted data” category only by declassiﬁcation,
upon a determination by the Atomic Energy Com-
mission that the publication of such data would not
adverselyl affect the common defense and security.
Declassi cation obviously is not the remedy. The
remedy lies in reliance upon the standard security
measures of the user, the Department of Defense.
I recommend, therefore, that the statutory deﬁni-
tion of “restricted data” be amended to exclude
information concernin the utilization of atomic
weapons, as distinguis ed from information on
their theory, design, and manufacture.
(2) In addition to information which falls
wholly within the utilization category, there is
information which concerns primarily the utiliza-
tion of weapons but which pertains also to their
design and manufacture. In order to avoid diﬂi-
culties in this marginal zone, I recommend legisla-
tion which also would authorize removal of such
information from the “restricted data” category.
This would be done onl when the Commission and
the Department of Defense jointly determine that
it relates primarily to military utilization of
atomic weapons and that it can be adequately safe~
arded as classiﬁed defense information under
t e Espionage Act and other applicable law.
(3) Consistent with these changes, I recommend
that the Department of Defense join with the
Atomic Energy Commission in any declassiﬁca-
tion of “restricted data” which relate primarily to
military utilization of atomic weapons and which
can be published without endangermg the national
security. Thus, the Department of Defense will
have an appropriate voice in the protection and
declassiﬁcation of such “restricted data” and the
responsibilities of the Commission will be clariﬁed
with respect to all other “restricted data.”
Domestlc Development of Atomlc Energy
What was only a hope and a distant oal in
1946, the beneﬁcent use of atomic energy in uman
service, can soon be a reality. Before our scientists
and engineers lie rich possibilities in the har-
nessing of atomic power. The Federal Govern-
ment can pioneer in its development. But, in this
undertaking, the enterprise, 1nitiative, and com-
petitive spirit of individuals and groups within
our_free economy are needed to assure the greatest
efﬁciency and progress at the least cost to the
public.
Industry’s interest in this ﬁeld is already evi-
dent. In collaboration with the Atomic Energy
Commission, a number of private corporations are
now conducting studies, largely at their own ex-
ense, of the various reactor types which might
e developed to produce economic power. There
are indications that they would increase their
efforts signiﬁcantly if the way were open for ri-
vate investment in such reactors. In amen ing
the law to permit such investment, care must be
taken to encourage the development of this new
industry in a manner as nearly normal as poss1ble
with careful regulation to protect the nationa
security and the public health and safet . It is
essential that this rogram so proceed t at this
new industry will Seve op self-reliance and self-
sufﬁciency.
The creation of opportunities for broadened in-
dustrial participation may permit the Government
to reduce its own reactor research and develo ment
after private industrial activity is well estab ished.
For the present, in addition to contributing
toward the advancement of ower reactor tech-
nology, the Government will) continue to speed
progress in the related technology of military
propulsion reactors. The present com lementary
efforts of industry and Government wi 1 therefore
continue, and industry should be encouraged by
the enactment of appropriate legislation to assume
a substantially more signiﬁcant role. To this end,
I recommend amendments to the Atomic Energy
Act which would:
1. Relax statutory restrictions against owner-
ship or lease of ﬁssionable material and of facili-
ties capable of roducing ﬁssionable material.
2. Permit private manufacture, ownership, and
operation of atomic reactors and related activi-
ties, subject to necessary safe ards and under
licensing systems administered.u by the Atomic
Energy Commission.
3. Authorize the Commission to establish mini-
mum safety and security regulations to govern the
use and possession of ﬁssionable material.
4. Permit the Commission to su ply licensees
special materials and services needed) 1n the initial
stages of the new industry at prices estimated to
compensate the Government adequately for the
value of the materials and services and the expense
to the Government in making them available.
5. Liberalize the patent provisions of the Atomic
Energy Act, principally by expanding the area in
which private patents can be obtained to include
the production as well as utilization of ﬁssionable
material, while continuing for a limited period the
authority to require a patent owner to license
others to use an invention essential to the peace-
time applications of atomic energy.
Until industrial participation in the utilization
of atomic ener acquires a broader base, con-
siderations of falrness require some mechanism to
assure that the limited number of companies,
which as government contractors now have access
to the program, cannot build a patent monopoly
which would exclude others desiring to enter the
ﬁeld. I hope that participation in the develop-
ment of atomic power will have broadened sufﬁ-
ciently in the next 5 years to remove the need for
such provisions.
In order to encourage the greatest possible prog-
ress in domestic application of atomic energy,
ﬂexibility is necessary in licensing and regulatory
