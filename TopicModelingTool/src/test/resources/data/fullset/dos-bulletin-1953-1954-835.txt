ducers, manufacturers, transporters, or marketers.
Our own incursions in these ﬁelds have not always
been too successful, while we have by no means lost
si ht of the somewhat unhappy experiences of cer-
taln highly developed and industrialized democ-
racies which have experimented with socialism.
And certainly Iron Curtain countries have given
the best poss1ble example of how collectivism can
result in sub-standard levels of living. It would
appear that state enterprise, by its nature, is in-
herently vulnerable to pressures which, while
often admirable in aim and purpose, are not con-
ducive t0 proﬁtable, efﬁcient, and competitive 0 -
erations. Thus it is understandable that the U. .
is reluctant to participate in rograms abroad
under which overnments would engage directly
or indirectly in industries into which private en-
terprise—either domestic, foreign, or mixed—is
willing to venture.
Placing, as we do, our main reliance on private
capital as the primary source of foreign assistance
in the economic development process, the basic
conditions favorable to its attraction are of great
importance. Some of these conditions rely upon
the control of government while others are subject
to the beneﬁcent inﬂuence of sound policy.
The more important of these conditions include
guarantees of property and contract rights.
IVhile the opportunity to earn a reasonable return
on investment is, of course, the prize for which
private enterprise strives at home and abroad, it
generally requires no government guarantee of a
reasonable return except in the case of public utili-
ties or other regulated enterprise, but it does de-
mand assurances that governments will not take
actions which will make a reasonable return
impossible.
\Vhat I have just said should not be interpreted
as indicating that Latin America is against private
enterprise. The proponents of private initiative
are a growing and powerful force in all the major
countries of the continent and in some the develop-
ment process is passing through a period not un-
like that to which we refer in our own country
as the Era of Manifest Destiny. What I do wish
to convey is that in all but a very few of our sister
Republics, there is a tendency to be highly selec-
tive as concerns foreign private capital invest-
ment; to impose burdensome or prohibitory re-
strictions on certain ﬁelds of investment; and
under popular pressure to promote the economic
development processes or because of nationalistic
complexes to engage directly in a number of ﬁelds
of economic activity in which private initiative
has a proven record of accomplishment.
Need for Greater Economlc Understandlng
There is thus an urgent need for greater eco-
nomic understanding between us. If we are to
achieve that greater understanding, all of us will
have carefully to reexamine our positions and our
policies. Many of our sister Republics can proﬁt-
ably re-assess their attitudes toward the part
that foreign capital and initiative could lay in
their economic development, while the .S. can
just as proﬁtably reexamine and more clearly de-
ﬁne certain of its olicies in the foreign economic
ﬁeld. This reeva uation can be of distinct bene-
ﬁt to all concerned, for resent trade and invest-
ment ﬁgures will be 100 ed back upon as unim-
pressive if economic expansion in Latin America
continues at the present rate. For the progress of
this area in the postwar period has been little short
of phenomena] ; total production at constant rices
has doubled in the last two decades; populhtion
has increased by 42 percent; and output per ca ita
has grown at an annual rate of 214 percent. he
value of manufacturin has gone up 70 percent
in the last 7 years, an today industrial centers
such as Siio Paulo and Mexico City make the classi-
ﬁcation of several of our neighbors as “underde-
veloped” a constantly greater misnomer.
U.S. private investment has ﬂowed into Latin
America since the end of the Second World \Var
at an average rate of around $250 millions per
year, and in addition, American companies have
reinvested earnings at the average rate of approxi-
mately $190 millions per year.
The U.S. Government has sup lemented this
ﬂow of private capital. During tlie period since
the Second World War the Latin American coun-
tries have been receiving loans through the Inter-
national Bank, of which we are a member, and
our own Export-1m ort Bank on a net basis (loans
less repayment) at t e rate of $93 million per year,
of which the Export-Import Bank has provided
about 75 ercent.
All of t is foreign assistance, while essential for
the ﬁnancing of the foreign currency component
of the economic development process, is, after all,
only a small part of the total investment being
made today in Latin America, since it is estimated
that Latin America is ﬁnancing between 90 and 95
percent of its economic development from domes-
tic resources.
This is the bright side of the coin. The other
side is that inﬂation has taken too great a toll of
living standard gains and there is a crying need for
sounder monetary and ﬁscal policy; population is
increasing at a rate higher than the food supply
and there are urgent needs in the ﬁelds of ex-
port industries, health and educational facilities,
and other measures which will lead to the estab-
lishment in each of the Latin American countries
of strong, self-reliant, and durable national econ-
omies.
We can and will play an important role in the
years to come, but I am sure that we all agree
with the words expressed recently by Assistant
Secretary Holland, when he said:
