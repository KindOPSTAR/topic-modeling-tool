ganda was false and that Soviet policies had
always been the prime deterrent to a large and
peaceful commerce, felt that some increase in
East-West trade would be beneﬁcial as a supple-
ment to their much greater trade in the free world.
They recognized the limitations of the Soviet bloc
as a stable, long-term trading partner, yet saw no
reason why an expansion should not be sought.
This attitude was stimulated by the Korean
truce of July 27, 1953. It was also stimulated by
the gestures that the Soviet Union began making
in the direction of livelier East-West trade.
Governments in the free world tended increas-
ingly to the view that some revisions in Western
controls might be made without sacriﬁce of se-
curity interests.
Basic Pelley Reelﬂrmed
The new administration in Washington, taking
account of such considerations as those, and wish-
ing to be sure that United States policy was the
most effective that could be devised, began a thor-
ough review of the economic defense policy of the
United States in the spring of 1953.
This policy review was completed around the
beginning of Au st. The third semiannual Bat-
tle Act re ort, w ich was published last Septem-
ber 28 an which covered the ﬁrst half of 1953,
stated that the conclusions of the review “will be
reﬂected in the economic defense actions of this
Government during the months to come.” In the
present report, which covers the second half of
1953, it is ssible to give more information about
those conc usions.
As a result of the policy review the basic eco-
nomic defense policy of the United States was
rcaﬁi’rmed. There were, however, some shifts of
emphasis—with respect to trade with the Soviet
bloc in Europe—designed to make the basic policy
more effective. We shall discuss those shifts pres-
ently, but ﬁrst let’s summarize the basic policy as
it has existed throughout the 6 months covered
by this report.
This basic policy of the United States on East-
West trade rested on the following principles:
1. Mutual security can best be advanced by
continued increase in the political, economic, and
military strength and cohesion of the free na-
tions relative to that of the Soviet bloc.
2. The free nations should not furnish a po—
tential a gressor with goods which directl and
material y aid its war industry and military
buildup.
3. The free world may derive a net security
advantage out of some East-West trade.
4. Security export controls should be applied
on a selective basis, except in the case of military
aggression, when a policy of complete embargo
may be in order.
In accordance with those principles the United
States has long been exercising certain controls
over its own trade. Here is a. short description of
those controls:
United States exports to Soviet bloc in Europe:
Not prohibited entirely, but limited to clearly non-
strategic goods.
United States imports from Soviet bloc in
Europe: Not prohibited, except for certain types
of furs.
United States shi ping to Soviet bloc in Europe:
Not prohibited, i carrying properly licensed
goods.
United States exports to Communist China and
North Korea: Prohibited.
United States imports from Communist China
and N orth Korea: Prohibited. (Some licenses
were issued, though not recently, for goods needed
in United States military stockpiles and in special
hardship cases.)
United States shipping to Communist China and
North Korea: Prohibited.
As for the trade of the rest of the free world
with the Soviet bloc, the policy of the United
States was set forth in the Battle Act (the text of
which is at the end of this report) 2 and in certain
executive directives. The olicy was not to pre-
vent all East-VVest trade but to cooperate with
other free-world countries in a system of selective
and ﬂexible controls. The aim was to prevent
Soviet-bloc countries from obtaining items that
would contribute signiﬁcantly to their warmaking
power and to insure that the trade which did go on
served the real economic and security interests of
the West.
Ever since the Communist aggression in Korea
in 1950. the Far East has resented a policy prob-
lem different from the proﬁlem of controlling ship-
ments to the bloc in Europe. The official position
of the United States Government—both before
and after the 1953 policy review—was that the
current levels of controls by the United States and
the free world over shipments to Communist China
and North Korea should be maintained. Later on
in this chapter we shall report on what happened
in the China trade during the last half of 1953.
The New Dlreetlen ot Polley
So much for the basic policy. Now for the shifts
in emphasis that took place in United States eco-
nomic defense policy toward the Soviet bloc in
Europe during the 6 months covered by this report.
It was determined that the system of the free-
world controls that had been developed during
the last 4 years substantially satisﬁed the objec-
tives of retarding the buildup of Soviet warmak-
ing power and strengthening the free world rela-
tive to the Soviet bloc. The effort to extend the
