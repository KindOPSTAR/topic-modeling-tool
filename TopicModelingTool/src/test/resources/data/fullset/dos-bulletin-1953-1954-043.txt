bglence the conclusion that the US. ban on trade,
shipping, and ﬁnancial relations with Communist
China must be maintained, in the absence of a
fundamental change in the posture, the composi-
tion and the essential orientation of the regime.
_/ The Peiping regime in 1949 contemptuously re-
]ected o portunitles for friendship and normal
trade re ations. Those who have hoped that a
Western policy of “keepin a foot in the door”
would have a moderating e ect on the regime, and
perhaps alienate the regime from its Moscow atlili-
ation, have seen their hopes consistently dashed.
By maintaining a policy of pressure and diplo-
matic isolation we can at east slow the rowth of
the war-making potential of Communist China
and retar the consolidation of its diplomatic
position.' A relationship of dependence on the
senior partner as complete as we can make it will
not make the embrace any more congenial for
either the Soviet senior partner or the Chinese
Communist junior partner.
It is regrettable that I cannot produce any an-
acea which would solve all the vexing prob ems
posed by Communist China and remove this added
threat to our national security with one ma 'c
stroke. I do not have an?Y such formula an I
question whether anyone e se has.
It is not pleasant to have to report that nothing
better than a prolonged period of tension and un-
certainty may be in store for us. It is cold oom-
fort to say that the prospects of checkmating any
further encroachments of the opposition in the
Far East are slowly improvinv. \Ve all long for
a quick end to this gray period which is so costly,
so anxious, and so frustrating.
But let us take comfort in the assurance that we
now know the nature of the enemy, which should
deny him an more easy victories, in the belief
that a divinein implanted inner vonce inclines all
humanity to our Side; and in the conviction that
an system so violative of all the things mankind
hol'ds most dear must veritably carry within itself
the seeds of its own ultimate dissolution.

Withdrawal of Two U. S.
Divisions From Korea
Press release 67'! dated December 29
At his press can erence on December 29, Secre-
tary Dulles was as ed whether the projected with-
drawal of two American divisions from Korea was
founded upon a general buildup of American mili-
tary power in the F or East, or whether it was to en-
courage a climate of peace in the area. He was
also asked how such a withdrawal would aﬁect the
strength 0 the United States in Japan. M r.
Dulles m e the following reply .-
The withdrawal or prospective withdrawal of
two divisions from Korea is due to a combination
of circumstances. One of those circumstances is
the fact that there was a very considerable buildup
of United States stren h in Korea in the few
weeks which immediate y preceded the armistice.
That was done as one of the many moves which we
made to try to bring the armistice about, and the
two divisions now to be withdrawn are to a large
extent the e uivalent of the buildup which was
made shortly efore the armistice.
A second point is that one of the many im or-
tant reasons or the armistice was to get away om
having a large part of the United States armed
forces permanently pinned down on the Asian
mainland, and the armistice would not have ac-
complished one of its major intended purposes if
1t did not operate to give greater mobility and
greater choice to United States military strength
1n the Asian theater.
A third point is that in fact there has been, as
the President’s statement ointed out,‘ a very sub
stantial buildup of sea an air power, and we have
emphasized on one or two occasions that if there
is a renewal of hostilities in Korea or if the Chi-
nese Communists should openly intervene in Indo-
china the reactions on our part would not neces-
sarily be conﬁned to the particular area which the
Communists chose to make the theater of their
new aggression. The implication of that is that,
instead of trying to meet any such new aggressions
merely by land power of our own in As1a, there
would be more reliance on sea and air power which
would give us a greater choice. All those things
combined make logical the action which the Presi-
dent announced.

Now when you speak about strength in relation
to our position in Japan, if you’re thinking in
terms 0 the ability to inﬂict damage upon a pos-
sible enem , that power is being increased. If
you’re thin ing of power merely in terms of actual
numbers of foot soldiers, that I would say is on a
declining basis as far as U. S. forces in Korea are
concerned. There has been no decision yet in that
respect as regards Japan.
Our power will, I believe, on net balance be
greater than it has been heretofore. And the
President’s statement made very clear, and this
should always be emphasized, this action that has
