to the re 'stered agencies in the collective value of
$76.6 mi lien or 6.8 percent of the contributions
received from all sources during the postwar years,
including: $57.5 million as the concessional value
of surplus dairy products made available by the
Department of Agriculture; $14.7 million reim-
bursement for ocean freight costs on voluntary
shipments' $2.7 million as ants for services to
the United States Escapes rogram; $1.4 million
for contractual services with the Technical Coop-
eration Administration; and $.3 million in sup rt
of the Educational Exchange Service of thque-
artment of State, including other miscellaneous
ederal assistance.
Reimbursement from Federal funds for the costs
of the ocean transport of supplies to the Marshall
E13 countries, and countries of the Near and Far
, where a cements have been negotiated, has
been an essential form of aid to the registered vol-
untary agencies. Eighty percent of the reimburse-
ments were on account of shi ments to Austria,
German ,Greece, and Italy. he Voluntary agen-
cies pai from their own resources for all the ex-
penses in the transport of both voluntary and
government-donated supplies from the points of
origin to United States seaports. The a encies
also paid for both domestic and ocean rei ht
charges to countries not included under the ar-
shall plan and to countries not eligible for eco-
nomic and technical assistance as authorized by
mutual security legislation.
The voluntary agencies also cooperated directly
with public organizations in sufiport of refugee
pro ms and special projwts. ndeed it was rec-
ognized that the help of these agencies was indis-
ensable, largely because of the personal and
amily nature of this form of social service. A
number of these agencies were accredited to the
Displaced Persons Commission by the Advisory
Committee on Volunta Foreign Aid and par-
ticipated in the operatlons of the Commission
through sponsorship of eligibles and providing for
their reception and nal settlement in communities
throughout the country.
Allocations of funds or reimbursement of ex-
penditures in the amount of $39,200,000 was pro-
vided by the International Refugee Organiza-
tion, the Intergovernmental Committee for Euro-
pean Migration, the United Nations High Com-
missioner for Refugees, the United Nations Relief
and Works A ency for Palestine Refugees, and
the United ations Korean Reconstruction
A ency.
n addition to these sources of sup ort there
should be considered the services, faci ities, and
goods provided b the governments and indige-
nous agencies 0 the participating countries.
Agreements with the United States by these gov-
ernments included the waiver of customs duties
and taxes and defrayment of port, warehouse, and
transportation costs to distribution ports. Al-
though the help provided cannot be accurately
evaluated, it is reasonable to assume that it was
no less in value than the help provided by the
United States Government to the American vol-
untary agencies.
Government sup ort, however, is not to be meas-
ured with the yardstick of subsidies; the greater
value has been in the extension of good ofﬁces and
the facilitating of agreements and cooperation
with the participating governments.
Conclusion
The number of re 'stered voluntary agencies,
and the value of the nude and oods made avail-
able to them from overnmenta and nongovern-
mental sources, an their distribution overseas
durin the 14 ears following the outbreak of
Worl War II, eptember 1939 to Jul 1953, may
be summarized in the four tables whic follow.
The relation of the number of registered agen-
cies to the time and value of contributions is
revealing. The registrations and the termination
of registrations were greatest during the time of
confusion and emotion following the outbreak of
war. In the active war years the re istration of
many agencies was terminated and ut few new
ones registered—a reﬂection of the control meas-
ures over solicitation through license, of or an-
ized cooperation in fund-raising (National ar
Fund), and of consolidation of agencies. The
measures of cooperation and consolidation estab-
lished in the war years were continued into the
postwar years; thus the total registration of 624
agencies was reduced to 56 at the time of the trans-
fer from the Department of State to the Foreign
Operations Administration on July 1, 1953.
