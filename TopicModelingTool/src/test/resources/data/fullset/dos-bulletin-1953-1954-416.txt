the ﬁrst American Minister to the Netherlands.
It is amusing to recall that, in 1792, instructions
were given John Adams’ son, John Quincy Adams
my distinguished predecessor, who 5 ant some of
his student days at the University 0 Leiden that
his principal duties at The Hague would be to
“borrow money and superintend the loan already
existing.”
The next important step after the Marshall plan
was our Jparticipation in the North Atlantic
Treaty. oining NATO was for the United States
a revolutionar step. For the ﬁrst time in our
histor we ple ged ourselves to give of our blood
and 0 our wealth, not at our own will and timing,
but whenever any member nation should be at-
tacked. Make no mistake, we shall stand by that
pledge. In evidence thereof is the fact that to date
we have expended one thousand million dollars
in equi ping the armed forces of your countr
alone. t is my ﬁrm conviction that our men wi 1
not be withdrawn, our material aid will not end
so lon as they are needed.
Wit in the framework of the United Nations,
ipeciﬁcally article 51, the North Atlantic Treaty
rganization has become a vital instrument for
collective security. The voice of each member is
heard; the nations work together in harmony and
for all-important purposes—to keep the peace and
to insure the continued strength of the area the
treaty embraces. Quite apart from its character
as an organization for our common defense, how-
ever, it is a body through which the member states
can further their collective well-being. This was
made plain b the declaration of the members of
the North At antic Council following their meet-
ing in Lisbon in February of 1952.‘ It said:
The partnership between the nations of the North
Atlantic Treaty is not for defense alone but of enduring
progress. The members of the Council look forward to
the time when the main energies of their association can
be less concentrated on defense and more fully devoted
to cooperation in other ﬁelds, for the well-being of their
peoples and for the advancement of human progress.
To be sure, at the present time, the defensive
aspects of NATO are of rimary concern to us,
and pertinent to these de ensive aspects is Lenin’s
so-called “Tidal Theory of Revolution,” so basic
to all Kremlin policies. I consider an understand-
ing of Lenin’s theory of utmost im ortance to us
all. Let me brieﬂy remind you w at it means:
Lenin reasoned that any process which is not com-
pletely planned has its ups and downs. Since
istory is not a complete] Iplanned process, the
revolutionary movement 0 olshevism (a part of
history) necessarily has an ebb and ﬂow. It fol-
lows that one should always ride with the tide
and should push one’s future to the limit when
the tide is in ﬂood. An ebb is bound to come,
however, and when it comes, one should again ride
with the tide. Then it behooves the Communist
Party to lie low, said Lenin. Take one step back-

ward in order to take two steps forward at a
later date. Parenthetically I might add that, of
all people in the world, on Dutch are most aware
pit téie importance of ikes when the tide is in
00 .
In Europe, with NATO as our major instrument,
we, to ether with our allies, have, I think, brought
the ti e to a stand and we must keep it there. At
the same time we must seize every opportunit
by peaceful means, and I stress the word peacefu ,
to induce it to recede.
The Soviet regime concedes only what is forced
upon it by strength but our strength can be effec-
tive only if we are really prepared to use it. In
Korea, the free world showed its preparedness to
stand to ether. While I would not say that the
tide has een halted throughout Asia it has been
checked in Korea and it has been retarded else-
where. And had we not acted in Korea as we did
the creeping enslavement of which I spoke would
surely have paralyzed the world. The Kremlin
took a calculated risk and lost. It would, in my
view never have set in motion the invasion of
South Korea had it believed we would react as we
did.
Next, we have thrown our full support behind
the efforts of \Vestern Europe to increase its
strength through the European Defense Commu-
nity. Important in this support is our belief that
alt ough the Soviet Union in action is highly op-
portunist, its method is consistent: it is the method
of trial and error. The less we in the West seem
ready to meet ag ession, the more the Soviet
will probe our soli arity, our strength of pur ose,
and our will to o pose its predatory moves. on
in the N etherlan s understand, of course, as fully
as do we the im ortance of the European Defense
Communit an have demonstrated that fact by
ratif in t 1e treaty at the timely moment just be-
fore er in.
The last evidence of cooperation which I shall
mention tonight is that of the peaceful use of
atomic ower. The President’s speech before the
Genera Assembly of the United Nations on De-
cember 8 was of great signiﬁcance; its importance
has been recognized. Here we have a concrete
proposal for sharing the knowledge of the world’s
scientists for the abundant welfare of all nations.
This tremendous scientiﬁc development can be-
come the greatest force for ood or the greatest
force for evil in the world’s 'story. It must be
for the good.
Borlln Conference
May I now touch on a recent political develo
ment of great im ortance to us all. At the Berlin
conference, whic has just closed, the Western
Powers sought in good faith to do their utmost
to bridge the differences between East and West.
Unfortunately the Soviet attitude deprived their
efforts of success. The Conference itself, how-
ever, has been important. It has proved con-
