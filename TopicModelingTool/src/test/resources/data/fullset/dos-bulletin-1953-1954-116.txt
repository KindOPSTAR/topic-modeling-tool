may be said to have accomplished already its primary
objective in establishing a desirable basis for worldwide
uniformity. Whether or not the Protocol is signed and
retitled by all nations as a binding international agree-
ment. its value will be recognized as a guide to national
practices.
2. The United States approves in principle the proposed
"Draft Protocol on a Uniform System of Road Signs and
Signals" but is unable to sign and ratify for the following
reasons:
(a) All of the road signs and signals in this country
are installed by the various political subdivisions—states.
counties. nuinicipaiitics. ctc. Since a substantial measure
of uniformity has been achieved through voluntary ad-
herence to the American Standard “Manual on Uniform
Traiiic Control Devices" and through the administrative
authority of the United States Bureau of Public Roads
in the Department of Commerce, it does not appear de-
sirable at present to endeavor to impose by law or treaty
a single national system.
(b) Changes in the American standard manual above
referred to are under consideration from time to time.
There is need in the United States for a certain ﬂexibility
in specifications, which would be impaired by adherence
now to an international code.
3. The above observations are based on the special
situation existing in the United States. where road mile-
ugc. vehicle usage. sign and signal installations. and the
legal authority of the individual states present a large
and complicated problem. The observations would not
appear to apply to many other nations. in which the
I'nlted Nations proposals could doubtless be adopted
promptly and with relatively little diﬂiculty, for example.
those in which road-signing is still in an early state of
development or those which have centralized national
authority in such matters.
4. The following answers are submitted to certain spe-
ciﬂc questions posed by the Secretary General of the
United Nations:
(a) The United States has no technical observations
to make on the speciﬁc contents of the “Draft Protocol
on a Uniform System of Road Signs and Signals." which
appear highly satisfactory for adoption in numerous coun-
tries. The l'nited States hopes that the Protocol will be
so adopted. that the matter will be kept under review
by the Economic and Social Council and its Transport
and Communications Commission. and that the Secretary
General will report periodically on the status of adoption
of the Protocol or of the acceptance of its provisions by
other means.
(bl The United States defers to the judgment of other
governments as to an appropriate date for the opening
of the Protocol for signature.
(0) The United States is unable to sign or ratify the
Protocol at present. but the appropriate agencies of the
Federal Government will maintain contact with state
and local authorities with a view to the eventual adoption
by them. to as large an extent as possible, of the uniform
standards set forth in the Protocol.
The Questlon of States’ nghts
With regard to the two proposals discussed
above. there may appear to be some inconsistency
in the positions taken by the U.S. Government.
In the one case, the new international agreement
would recognize foreign drivers’ licenses without
any action being taken by the States individually.
In the other case, the States will continue in their
freedom to use road signs and signals of their own
choosing.
Actually there is no real conﬂict in principle.
Both proposals lie in the ﬁeld of interstate and
foreign commerce, control of which has always
been reserved to the Federal Government, subject
to the action of Congress. Recognition of foreign-
driver permits by international treaty has im-
portant practical advantages. Aside from the
administrative diliiculties that would be involved,
the Constitution does not permit individual States
to enter into reciprocal agreements with foreign
countries. In any event, the United States, by
ratifying the Convention on Road Trailic of 1949
and the Convention on the Regulation of Inter-
American Automotive Trailic of 1943, has already
accepted recognition of foreign-driver permits as
national policy. The standardization of road
signs and signals, on the other hand, is not con-
sidered practical because the benefits of decentral-
ized administration still seem to outweigh the pos-
sible advantages of a more complete uniformity,
even on an international basis.a
Customs Formalltln on Automoblln and Tourlun
A third project which stems in part from the
basic work performed on the 1949 Convention on
Road T raﬁic relates to customs formalities for the
temporary importation of private vehicles and for
tourism. Its urpose is to standardize and sim-
plifyuhe requirements to which tourists’ automo-
iles and tourists’ effects in general are subject
when crossing international boundaries.
In June 1949 the United Nations Economic Com-
mission for Europe (Eon) completed a draft cus-
toms convention covering both automobiles and
general touring in a single document. In Sep-
tember of that year the world Conference on Road
and Motor Trans ort at Geneva gave attention to
the special prob em of customs formalities for
private automobiles and wrote into article 3 of
the Convention on Road Traffic brief provisions

'In the developing of these positions. the following
agencies and organizations, which were consulted and
given complete documentation. approved the statements to
the U.N. Secretary-General essentially as quoted above
or, in a few instances, with respect to one or the other of
the proposals. stated that they were not qualified to express
