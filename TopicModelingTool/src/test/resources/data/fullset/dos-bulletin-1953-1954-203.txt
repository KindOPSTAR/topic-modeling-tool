the old colonial interests of our allies.” Mr.
Dulles was convinced that American )olicy had
become “unnecessarily ambiguous” in this matter,
and he stressed that the Western Powers could
“gain, rather than lose, from an orderly develop-
ment of self- overnment” throughout the world.
Secondly, h r. Dulles noted the popular demand
for better standards of livin I—a demand which
could no longer be ignored. e believed that the
United States could usefully help in ﬁnding a so-
lution of this problem “by contributing advanced
technical knowledge about transport, communica-
tion, fertilization, and use of water for irrigation,”
under the mutual-security program.
Thirdly, Mr. Dulles believed that the United
States “should seek to allay the deep resentment
against it” that had “resulted from the creation
of Israel.” The Arab peoples, he said, were
“afraid that the United States would back the
new State of Israel in aggressive expansion.”
They were “more fearful of Zionism than of com-
munism,” and were afraid that the United States
would “become the backer of expansionist Zion-
ism.” Israel, on the other hand, was fearful lest
ultimately the Arabs might try to push it into the
Mediterranean Sea.
In this connection, the Secretary made it clear
that the United States still stood by the Tripartite
Declaration of May 25, 1950, as to violations of
frontiers or armistice lines. He also indicated
that leaders in Israel themselves “agreed with us
that United States policies should be impartial so
as to win not only the respect and regard of the
Israeli but also of the Arab peoples,’ and that
the United States would seek such policies. There
was a need for peace in the Middle East, achieve-
ment of which would require concessions both on
the part of Israel and on that of the Arab States,
and the Secretary declared that the United States
would not “hesitate by every appropriate means
to use its inﬂuence to promote a step-by-step re-
duction of tension in the area and the conclusion
of ultimate peace.”
Eeenemle Aid
On May 5, in his message to Congress on the
extensmn of foreign aid, President Eisenhower
had noted that technical, economic, and develop-
mental programs are of great importance. He
said,
They will be applied chieﬂy to South and Southeast Asia,
the Middle East. Latin America. and Africa. Through
these programs, the United States is proving its interest
in helping the peoples 01' these areas to work toward better
and more hopeful conditions of life, to strengthen the
foundations of opportunity and freedom. To guard
against the external military threat is not enough: we
must also move against those conditions exploited by
subversive forces from within.
The United States Congress approved the for-
eign-aid bill on August 3, 1953. major feature
of that legislation was the size of the appro ria-
tions for countries of the Near East and ia.
More than $33 million was a propriated for tech-
nical assistance to the Near lgast and Africa; $147
million was set aside for economic assistance to
the Arab States, Israel, and Iran; and some $44
million authorized to help the Arab refu ees.
In view of amendments to the Mutual ecurity
Act—particularly the introduction in the ﬁscal
year 1954 of the $147 million regional “special
economic aid” package—it is impossible to give
comparable ﬁgures for earlier years, but it can
be said that total authorizations to the Near East
and Africa for the current year are substantially
higher than in the past.
The Retugeee
On July 24 the United States Senate Foreign
Relations Subcommittee on the Near East and
Africa presented its re ort based upon extensive
hearings to determine ow American aid could
be given most eliectively to Palestinian Arab ref-
ugees. The report expressed deep sympath for
the refugees and the plight in which they ound
themselves. It added, however,
The American people are moved by strong humanitarian
motives, but they cannot be expected to bear indeﬁnitely
so large a share of the burden involved in this situation
when Israel and the Arab States show so little initiative
in helping to settle the matter among themselves. There
is a very real danger that the longer the United States
continues to supply relief money, the less desire there
will be on the part of the states in this area to make real
efforts on their own to liquidate the problem.
During the following months, much thought and
attention was given by the U.S. Government to the
problem of the Arab refugees. On November 12,
1953, the U.N. Assembly’s Special Political Com-
mittee voted to continue the United Nations Re-
lief and \Vorks A ency for Palestine Refugees.
The resolution, w iich was s onsored by the
United States, Great Britain, lg‘rance, and Tur-
key, later received full Assembly approval. It
continued UNRWA throu h June 1955; author-
ized an UNRWA relief bu get of almost $25 mil-
lion for the year ending June 30, 1954; and recom-
mended a rovisional relief budget of $18 million
for the following year. The $200 million UNRWA
fund for projects which was authorized by
the U.N. Assembly 2 years ago was maintained.
Pursuant to the Mutual Security Act of 1953,
a Special Refugee Survey Commission to the Near
East was appointed by Mr. Stassen in consultation
with the Secretary of State. An interim report of
this Commission, dated December 11, 1953,2 reads
in part:
This government has both a stake and responsibility,
together with the other members of the United Nations,
in the ﬁnal solution of the refugee problem. Arabs and
Israelis, for different reasons, recognize our concern in
