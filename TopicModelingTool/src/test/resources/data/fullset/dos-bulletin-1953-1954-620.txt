matter in which we cannot afford to be idle, and
the resolution we have proposed includes a state-
ment on scholarships, particularl in relation to
the need for more women trained, for leadership
in education.
Our resolution also suggests that ersoo pro-
vide in future reports an analysis, ﬁrst, on meth-
ods which seem to have been helpful in increasin
school attendance by girls, and second, on expan -
ing the use of women as teachers in areas where
it has not been customary to employ them. I
understand that much of this information may
already be available in the material which comes
into UNI-ECO regularly from overnments on im-
plementing Resolution 32 o the 14th Interna-
tional Conference on Public Education, which dis-
cussed compulsory education and its prolongation,
and in other reports from these conferences. In
View of the large number of countries sponsoring
this resolution, we hope it will have serious con-
Sideration.
Israel-Jordan Border Sltuatlon
Statement by Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.
U.S. Representative to the United Nations1
The present situation in Palestine is one that
must be taken very seriously. It should not be
treated in a procedural narrow way which would
obscure the necessity for measures not only to pre-
vent the continuance of the disturbances but also
to look for more far-reaching solutions. It seems
to me that anyone who has been following recent
events in Palestine, whether he is an expert on
the Security Cormcil or whether he is a private
citizen, would be immediate] aware that there
is more involved here than ﬁn ings under individ-
ual complaints of violations of the Armistice
Agreements. The complaints listed on the agenda
cannot in our opinion be separated into airtight
compartments.
Let me make clear at once that the United States
is seriously concerned when any government—
especially any member of the United Nations
bound by agreements approved by the Security
Council and by her obligations under the charter-—
presumes to take the law into her own hands in a
policy of reprisal and retaliation. We made this
perfectly clear at the time that we discussed the

‘Made in the Security Council on Apr. 8 (U.S./U.N.
press release 1899).
Qibya incident in this Council,2 and I wish to
state now that we continue to hold this view.
This re eated resort to this policy of reprisal and
retaliation must stop.
Reference has been made by several s eakers
to the ﬁnding of the Israel-Jordan Mixe Armi-
stice Commission concerning the attack on the
village of Nalilialiii which is, in our opinion, a
matter of utmost gravity of a type clearly de-
serving of condemnation. But also it is not enough
in an affair of this kind to have discussions, to
make ﬁndings and to issue condemnations. The
situation along the Israel-Jordan border since the
passage of the resolution on Qibya, on the 24th of
ovember 1953,3 has not improved. This Council
recognized at that time the obligations of both
Israel and Jordan under Security Council resolu-
tions and the General Armistice Agreement to
prevent all acts of violence on either side of the
emarcation line, and reaﬂirmed that it is essential
in order to achieve progress by peaceful means
toward a lasting settlement of the issues outstand-
ing that the parties abide by their obli ations.
It was in that connection that the Counci recog-
nized the necessity of strengtlienin the Truce
Supervision Organization and of conSidering such
additional measures as might be necessary to carry
out the objectives of the Qibya resolution.
In our opinion it has become abundantly clear
that complaints such as those included in our pro-
visional agenda are interrelated. If we are to
take constructive action which will be helpful to
the parties themselves and conducive to peace in
the area, we must treat them as interrelated in our
consideration here. This is not only a matter of
rinciple but it is really the only practical way of
ealin with the present situation if this Security
Council is to continue to play a useful role in the
maintenance of international peace and security
as regards this problem.
While we need not in our opinion be bound by
precedent in such matters as these, and while I
think we should ﬁt our procedure to the problem
before us, the course of action which I propose is
based on sound precedent. Members of the Coun-
cil will recall that at the 514th meeting of October
20, 1950, the provisional agenda headed “The
Palestine Question :” had six subitems involving
alleged violations of two diﬂ'erent armistice agree-
ments and it was decided that when the Council
began its debate it would be permissible to refer to
each of the subitems while dealing with the ﬁrst.
Mr. President, it is in that spirit that the United
States approaches this debate.
