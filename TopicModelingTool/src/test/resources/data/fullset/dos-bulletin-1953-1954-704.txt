White House press release dated May 5
With the return of the Secretary of State from
Geneva, there will of course be a series of confer-
ences on foreign affairs both within the Executive
Department and between the Secretary of State and
bipartisan groups of the Congress. Because of these
forthcoming conferences and the probability that
the Secretary of State will himself have something
to say, and because, also, of the delicate nature of
the issues now pending before the Geneva Confer-
ence, I shall limit my comments on the Indochina
situation to a brief written statement.
United States foreign policy has consistently sup-
ported the principles on which was founded the
United Nations. A basic expression of this policy
was the Vandenberg Resolution of 1948. The United
States believes in assuring the peace and integrity
of nations through collective action and, in pursu-
ance of the United Nations principle, has entered
into regional security agreements with other na-
tions. Examples are the Inter-American Agreement,
the Naro Agreement, and a whole series of pacts
in the Paciﬁc. These arrangements are invariably
to assure the peaceful security of the contracting
nations and to prevent likelihood of attack; they
are not arrangements designed primarily for waging
war.
The Geneva Conference, now 9 days old, has pro-
duced no surprises. The expressed fears of some
have proved unfounded.
It has not been a “ﬁve-power" conference as the
Soviet Union tried to make it.
It has not involved establishing express or implied
diplomatic recognition by the United States of the
Chinese Communist aggressors.
The Korean phase of the Conference has been
organized. Here the Communists came up with a
scheme for Korean uniﬁcation which was a Chinese
copy of the Soviet scheme for the uniﬁcation of Ger-
many. Under their proposal no election measures
could be taken without Communist consent, and
there could be no impartial supervision of the elec-
tion conditions or of the voting.

News Conference Statement by the President
This scheme was rejected for Germany. Secre-
tary Dulles tells me that it is equally unacceptable
to the Republic of Korea and United Nations mem-
bers which took part in the Korean War under the
United Nations Command now represented) at
Geneva.
The Indochina phase of the Conference is in proc-
ess of being organized and the issues have not yet
been clariﬁed. In this matter a large measure of
initiative rests with the Governments of France,
Viet-Nam, Laos, and Cambodia, which are the coun-
tries most directly concerned.
Meanwhile plans are proceeding for the realiza-
tion of a Southeast Asia security arrangement.
This was publicly suggested by Secretary Dulles in
his address of March 29.‘ Of course, our principal
allies were advised in advance. This proposal of the
Secretary of State was not a new one; it was merely
reaﬂirmatlon of the principles that have consistently
guided our postwar foreign policy and a reminder
to interested Asian friends that the United States
was prepared to Join with others in the application
of these principles to the threatened area. Most of
the free nations of the area and others directly con-
cerned have shown afﬁrmative interest, and conver-
sations are actively proceeding.
Obviously, it was never expected that this collec-
tive security arrangement would spring into exist-
ence overnight. There are too many important
problems to be resolved. But there is a general
sense of urgency. The fact that such an organiza-
tion is in process of formation could have an im-
portant bearing upon what happens at Geneva
during the Indochina phase of the Conference.
The countries of the area are now thinking in con-
structive terms, which include the indispensable
concept of collective security. Progress in this
matter has been considerable and I am convinced
that further progress will continue to be made.

and by the three Western Powers at Berlin. The
same scheme is equally objectionable for Korea.
I can assure you that the United States delega-
tion will do all that lies within its power to pro-
mote, by peaceful means, the independence and
freedom and unity of Korea.
More than 140,000 Americans were killed or
wounded under the United Nations Command to
keep Korea from being overrun by armed invasion.
I promise you that we shall not surrender at the
council table at Geneva the freedom for which so
many fought and died.
We are ressin the Communists to accept
honest elections w ich will be supervised by re-
sponsible outside observers, who will assure a
really free election. Whether the Communists
accept that remains to be seen. If they would, then
I think that Korea could be uniﬁed.
Let me turn now to the problem of Southeast
Asia. In that great peninsula and the islands to
the south live nearly 200 million people in 7
states—Burma; the three states of Indochina—
Laos, Cambodia, and Viet-Nam; Thailand;
Malaya; and Indonesia. Communist conquest of
this area would seriousl im eril the free world
position in the \Vestern aci c. It would, among
other things, endanger the Philip ines, Australia,
and New Zealand, with all of w ich the United
States has mutual-security treaties. It would de-
prive Japan of important foreign markets and
sources of food and raw materials.
In Viet-Nam, one of the three Indochinese states,
war has been goin on since 1946. When it began,
Indochina was a rench colony just liberated from
Japanese occu ation. The war started rimarily
as a war for in ependence. What started) as a civil
war has now been taken over by international com-
munism for its own pu oses. Ho Chi-Minh, the
Communist leader in iet-Nam, was trained in
Moscow and got his ﬁrst revolutionary experience
in China.
In the name of nationalism, the Communists aim
