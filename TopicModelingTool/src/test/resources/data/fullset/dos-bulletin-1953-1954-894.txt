U. 5. Views on Communist Proposals at Geneva
Following are the texts of two statements made
by Under Secretary Smith at the Geneva Confer-
ence, one at the thirteenth plenary session on
Korea, June 5, and the other at the sixth plenary
session on Indochina, J was .9, together with a docu-
ment relating to the Neutral Nations Supervisory
Commission in Korea to which Mr. Smith made
reference in his J tone 9 statement.
STATEMENT 0N KOREA, JUNE 5
Some of m colleagues have spoken with great
feeling this a moon, as indeed the importance of
the occasion warrants. As I am, I hope, the last
speaker, I will exercise restraint in deference to
t e important statements which have been made,
as well as to those who have made them.
In the ﬁrst lace, it is true, as Mr. Nam 11 states,
that the Nort Korean regime on A ril 27 made
certain proposals. They proposed t e establish-
ment of an all-Korean commission which would
have the power to draw up an all-Korean elec-
tion law and to establish conditions for the elec-
tions throughout Korea. Ap arently, as an after-
thought, because they wishedJ to throw over this
roposal the cloak of international participation
1n the conduct of Korean elections, they suggested
the establishment of a “neutral natlons supervisory
commission” to assist the all-Korean commission.
Mr. Molotov today has spoken of an “all-Korean
body” and recommended it to us. The composi-
tion and tasks of this body, he says, shall be the
subject of examination. He has also referred to
and recommended to us an appro riate interna-
tional commission to supervise the oldin of free
all-Korean elections. The composition 0 this su-
pervisory commission, he says, shall be examined
urther.
Most of the delegations in this room have al-
ready pointed out quite clearly the character of
such proposals. I should like to address myself
to the ﬁrst because its character will indicate the
character of the second. Our Communist col-
leagues undertake to convince us that a commis-
sion of this composition might perform an honest
and impartial duty in conducting free elections in
Korea. The regrettable fact is that the Commu—
nist proposal is designed to establish a kind of
supergovernment in which the Communists would
have the power actually to frustrate any eﬁorts
to achieve honest elections.
As has been many times pointed out, a spurious
commission of this kind would consist of equal
numbers from North and South Korea, although
the relative difference in population has also been
pointed out many times. This commission would
also, I understand, have membershi of so-called
“social organizations”—-a concept With which we
have had unfortunate ex erience in the past, when
eﬁ'orts were made to uni Korea in the early da s
after the war. This commission is also, I shou d
judge by previous proposals, to have the ower to
suppress so-called “terrorist groups,” w ich we
lmow, unfortunately, by experience is the Commu-
nist name for any group that opposes them. A
most familiar and com letely signiﬁcant feature is
that our Communist co lea es insist that the com-
mission can operate only y a cement; that is,
the commission will operate on y if the Commu-
nists want to agree, and, of course, they will only
agree on their own terms. And this is what we
have known for years as the principle of unanim—
ity, or the “built-in veto.”
It is to assist this kind of commission that Mr.
Chou En-lai has felt himself obliged to suggest a
so-called “neutral nations supervisory commis-
sion.” Mr. Chou En-lai admitted the need for in-
ternational participation, and then he made a pro-
posal for international supervision that I regret
to say seems to me to be completely fraudulent.
His proposal is fraudulent because it pretends to
establish an international body which we are to
assume would have some authority and which
could assure honest elections. As a matter of fact,
such a body could do absolutely nothing, so long
as the control of the entire election rocedure was
in the all-Korean commission, in w ich the Com-
munists have their what I have called “built-in
veto.
