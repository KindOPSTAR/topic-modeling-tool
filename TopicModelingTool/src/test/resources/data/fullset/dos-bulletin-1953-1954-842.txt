U.S. and Iceland Agree on
Implementing of Defense Agreement
Press release 286 dated May 26
The United States and Iceland on May 25
reached an understanding on changes in the meth-
ods of implementing the U.S.-Icelandic Defense
Agreement of May 5, 1951.1 In response to the
request of the Icelandic Government received last
December, representatives of the United States
and Iceland—including an advisory team from
the Departments of State and Defense—began dis—
cussions February 2. Agreement was effected by
an exchange of notes between the Icelandic For-
eign Minister and the American Minister to Ice-
land, Edward B. Lawson, who negotiated the orig-
inal agreement of 1951.
In general the understandings reached are tech-
nical in nature. They pertain chieﬂy to how de-
fense construction work in Iceland and the plan-
ning, arrangement, and operation of the military
areas in Iceland can best be effected consistent
with NATO objectives of defending Iceland and the
North Atlantic area, while also taking into ac-
count problems eculiar to Iceland.
The basic U. ‘.-Iceland Defense Agreement of
May 5, 1951 was negotiated at the request of NATO
in view of Iceland’s lack of defenses. It has not
been altered in these negotiations.
