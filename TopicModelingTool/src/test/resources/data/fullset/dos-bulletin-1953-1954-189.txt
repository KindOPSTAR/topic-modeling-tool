Some Recent Developments In International Law
of Interest to the United States
by Herman Phleger
Legal Adviser ‘
It is a great pleasure to meet with you today.
Though I have practiced for more years than I
care to admit, it has been principally 1n California
and the West and in Washington. All :11 life I
have been brought up on the le end of t e skill
and invincibility of the Philade hia law er: of
John G. Johnson, and in later ays of Syenator
Reed and Senator Pepper and Mr. Justice Roberts.
Of course the term Philadelphia lawyer alpplies
to any Pennsylvania lawyer. So I am ad of
the opportunity at last, to meet face to ace the
lawyers who in the general acceptance of the coun-
try exemplify the ﬁnest traditions of our pro-
fession.
I will speak to you brieﬂy today on some of the
current problems of the United States in the ﬁeld
of international law and some recent developments
that may be of interest.
International law has been deﬁned as those rules
for international conduct which have met general
acceptance amon the community of nations. It
reﬂects and recor s those accommodations which,
over centuries, states have found it in their interest
to make. It rests upon the common consent of
civilized communities. It is not to be found in
any code. It is made up of precedent, judicial
decisions, treaties, arbitrations, international con-
ventions the opinions of learned writers in the
ﬁeld, and a myriad of other acts and things, which
represent in the aggre ate those rules which en-
lig tened nations and t eir people accept as bein
appropriate to govern international conduct. t
is constantly changing, and expanding, as mod-
ern science shrinks the worldand brings its peoples
into ever closer contact.
Skeptics deﬁne international law as the rules
which countries obey if they feel like it. Some go
even further—they say there is no such thing as
international law.
But there is such a thing as international law.

It has had a long and honorable, though chequered,
career. I predict that it will play an even more
important part in world affairs in the future than
it has in the past. Indeed, in this rapidl shrink-
ing world, it becomes increasingly evi ent that
our survival ma de end upon our success in sub-
stituting the ru e 0 law for the rule of force.
When we speak of international law, we realize
of course that it is made up of two distinct, though
related, subjects: Public international law and
private international law. The ﬁrst is usually
referred to as the law of nations, with sovereign
states as its subjects.
Prlvate International Law
The latter, rivate international law, is com-
monly called t e conﬂict of laws. It is an aspect
of private law which involves such juridical rela-
tions between individuals as transcend the sphere
of national law and, therefore, is not international
law in the true sense.
You all have had experience with problems of
conﬂicts of laws arisin out of interests ﬂowing
across the boundaries 0 the several States of the
Union. Many of you have had cases involving
interests which transcend our national boundaries
and thus in the realm of private international law.
It seems fair to say that international conﬂicts
of laws problems are usually more diﬂicult to solve
than those arising out of differences in the laws of
the several States of the Union. For example,
consider the problems that might arise out of a
contract negotiated in New York, si ed in Mas-
sachusetts, and performed in Pennsy vania. Con-
trast this with a contract negotiated in New York,
signed in France, and to be performed in Japan.
There the divergence of legal systems, the prob-
lems of jurisdiction, and the lack of a “full faith
and credit clause” are just a few of the additional
problems that must be met.
Because of our Constitutional federal-state rela-
tionship, the partici ation of our Federal Govern-
ment in the eld 0 private international law is
