munist Party of the Soviet Union, shall take prece-
dence over every other obligation including love
of country, obligation to family, and the honor of
one’s own personal conduct.
These conclusions are not speculation; they are
established facts, well known to all who have
serious] studied the Communist apparatus.
The act that this organization exists does not
mean that all members of all Communist parties
everywhere are conscious of its existence and of
their relationshi to it. Only a small proportion
of Communist lgarty members are initiated into
complete awareness of the nature of the movement
to which they belong and the real sources of its
authority. Most national Communist parties
masquerade as normal atriotic political parties,
purportin to reﬂect in igenous political impulses
and to be ed by indigenous elements.
Actually, eve one of these parties represents
a conspiracy wit in a conspiracy; the rank-and-
ﬁle members, while servin the purpose of du ing
others, are to a considerab e extent duped by t eir
own leaders. The leaders do not reveal fully to
the rank and ﬁle either the nature of their own
allegiance or the sources of their own authority
and funds.
The overall purpose for which this organization
is maintained and operated is to act as an instru-
ment for the advancement of the worldwide polit-
ical aims of the dominant group of Moscow leaders.
This, then, is the answer to “What is inter-
national communism”?
It may next be asked whether this international
Communist apparatus actually seeks to bring this
hemisphere, or parts of it, into the Soviet orbit.
The answer must be in the afﬁrmative.
I shall not here accuse any government or any
individuals of being either plotters or the dupes
of plotters. We are not sitting here as a court to
try governments or individuals. We sit rather as
legislators. As such, we need to know what will
enable us to take appropriate action of a general
character in the common interest. Therefore, I
shall conﬁne myself to presenting well-established
facts of that character.
When the Comintern was operating openly, it
trained at Moscow, largely in the Lenin School
numerous persons from the Americas. Some 0
them are still active.
International Front Orglnlatlons
There was a special Comintern headquarters,
and there were secret ﬁeld offices which controlled
and supported Communist activities in Latin
America. The Comintern also developed a series
of international front organizations designed to
enable its agents to et popular backing from spe-
cial groups such as abor, youth, women, students,
farmers, etc. These front organizations also
served as cover for the Soviet intelligence services.
When the Soviet Communist Party went
through the form of abolishing the Comintern,
these same front organizations were carried on in
a different form, With headquarters shifted from
Moscow usually to satellite ca itals. The Com-
munist International of Yout emerged as the
World Federation of Democratic Youth, with
head uarters in Budapest, and as the Interna-
tiona Students Union, with headquarters in
Prague. There is the Women's International
J uridical Association. There is the iVorld Peace
Council, located in Pra e. There is the World
Committee A ainst ar and Fascism. Most
owerful of al is the World Federation of Trade
nions, seated under Soviet auspices in Vienna.
There is the All Union Society for Cultural Rela-
tions Abroad which channels propaganda through
its local outlets, the various Sovnet friendship
societies.
These front organizations carry on important
activities in man of the American States. Their
members in this emisphere go back and forth to
the Soviet bloc countries, using funds which are
su lied by the Soviet Communist Party.
e basic facts I outline are well known. They
could be supplemented by masses of detail, but
that is unnecessary for our present purposes. It is
enough to know that international communism
olperates strongly in this hemisphere to accomplish
t 1e political purposes of its leaders who are at the
same time the leaders of the Soviet Communist
Party and of the Soviet Union.
International communism is not liberating but
enslaving. It has been suggested that, even
though the international Communist movement
operates in this hemisphere, it may serve a liberat-
ing purpose, compatible with principles of our
American States. Few, I believe, would argue
for that openly. The thesis is advanced rather by
innuendo and insinuation.
Such suggestions lose all plausibility when we
recall what this Communist movement has done
to the nations and the peoples it has come to domi-
nate. Let us think ﬁrst in terms of nations.
Many of us knew at the United Nations Jan
Masaryk, the son of the great author of Czechoslo-
vak freedom. He was a Foreign Minister who
believed, until almost the end, that the Communist
movement in his countr was something different;
that it could be reconci ed with the national free-
dom to which his father and he were so passion-
ately dedicated. But in the end his broken corpse
was offered to the world as mute evidence of the
fact that international communism is never “dif-
ferent” and that there can be no genuine reconcili-
ation between it and national freedom.
Czechoslovakia was stripped of every vestige of
sovereignty, as we in the Americas understand
that term. It was added to the list of victims,
which already in Europe included Latvia, Estonia,
Lithuania, Poland, East Germany, Albania, Hun-
gary, Rumania, and Bulgaria. These ten Euro-
pean nations, once proud and honorable examples
