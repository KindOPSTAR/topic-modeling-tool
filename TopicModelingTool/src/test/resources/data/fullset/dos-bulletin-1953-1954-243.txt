the head of the Guatemalan Communist Party,
and both closely associated with the leadin ﬁg-
ures of the Guatemalan Government. The 0 icial
Guatemalan press and radio ofﬁces, to which Presi-
dent Arbenz has appointed a group of dedicated
propagandists of communism such as Raul Leiva,
Carlos Alvarado Jerez, Otto Raul Gonzalez, and
Medardo Mejia, have a long record of circulating
false charges, typically Communist in their tech-
nique, against the United States, the United Na-
tions, and particularly those countries which have
been actively resisting Communist aggression.
The United States views the issuance of this
false accusation immediately prior to the Tenth
Inter-American Conference as a Communist ef-
fort to disrupt the work of this conference and
the inter-American solidarit which is so vital to
all the nations of the hemisp iere.
What the United Nations Means to the United States
by Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.
U .8. Representative to the United Natiom 1
It is a great honor to be speaking in this historic
place before this important audience. Here, in
this old colonial capitol, are symbolized events
which gave birth to this country—events which are
still as fresh, as vivid, and as contagious as they
were on the day that Patrick Henr , standing on
this very place, spoke out fearless y, eloquently,
immortally against t ranny and the forces of tyr-
anny. Every day tliat goes by sees brave men
coming through the Iron Curtain at the risk of
their lives in search of freedom because, like Pat-
rick Henry, they prefer death to slavery.
Coming from Massachusetts, in whose State
House also events took lace which played a vital
part in the forming ofp this country, and as one
who has served in the Legislature of the Common-
wealth of Massachusetts, I naturally have a deep
appreciation of what it means to address the Leg-
islature of Virginia. You are the authentic voice
of the sovereign people, and anyone occupying the
ofﬁce which I now hold must count it a privilege
to be able to report to you.
Today, I ask you to look at the United Nations,
to scrutinize its purposes, its achievements, its
shortcomings, its utility, and its future promise—
all with the utmost frankness. The times are far
too serious for self-delusion. We must see this
thing as it is—we must coolly appraise its value.
We must ask ourselves the great question which
We always ask ourselves in our oﬁicial capacity
as legislators: Is it good for America?

Burgesses at Williamsburg, Va., on Jan. 30 (press release

In bluntest terms, the United Nations is an in-
ternational device whose primary purpose is “to
save succeeding generations from the scourge of
war” by develo ing enough strength to deter ag-
gression and, i in s ite of the United Nations it
should occur, to repe it.
It was created by a charter, which was ratiﬁed
by the Senate by a vote of 89 to 2 in 1945 at the
close of the bloodiest war in history. It was in-
vited to establish itself in the United States by a
unanimous vote of the United States Congress
and has its headquarters in New York City.
To promote peace, the charter created a Security
Council of 11 members which has the power, sub-
ject to the veto of any one of its 5 permanent
members, in case of aggression to issue action or-
ders which are legally binding on all United Na-
tions members. .
It also set up a General Assembly, which can-
not issue orders but has power to debate and to
recommend. In the General Assembly each of
the 60 member nations has one vote, regardless
of size.
When the United Nations was founded, it was
assumed that the great allies of \Vorld War II
would stay together to keep peace. But the So-
viet Union became hostile to the free world and,
by its abuse of the veto, caused the Security Coun-
cil to become less and less active, with the result
that the General Assembly has become the busy
place. (A veto-proof method has at last been
evolved for bringing a collective defense program
into being by recommendations passed b a two-
thirds vote of the General Assembly. \ hen, as,
and if aggression occurs in the future, we will no
