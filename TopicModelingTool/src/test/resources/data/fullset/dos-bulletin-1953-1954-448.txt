inte rity rogram applies only to these citizens.
We ave ecided that all of our employees occupy
sensitive ositions since we have been unable to
isolate eit er high or low grade position to a point
that the employee is not, conceivably, in a position
to obtain or handle material which can vitally
affect our national security. The order provides
that persons occupying sensitive ositions must
have a full ﬁeld 1nvestigation. \ hat is a full
ﬁeld investi ation?
The ﬁrst t ing checked in a full ﬁeld investiga-
tion is other government agencies. This is termed
a “record” check or “name check” whereby all
other sensitive government agencies, such as the
FBI, the Central Intelligence Agency, congres-
sional committees, Ofﬁce of Naval Intelligence,
G—2, and other a encies are checked to determine
if they have anyt ling of record on the individual.
If it is learned that one of these agencies has
derogatory material, it is reviewed, and if it is of
such a nature as to show conclusively the indi-
vidual would not be the type for De artmental
employment his investigation may be ropped at
that time.
Of course the applicant’s place of birth must
be veriﬁed and, if he is a naturalized citizen, this
must be checked. Inquiries are made into his
back round and the general reputation of his
fami y. A review is made of his scholastic rec-
ords, including interviews with former teachers
and other qualiﬁed persons. His employment
experience is checked and former employers and
coworkers are interviewed. All references given
by the applicant are contacted and they often
suppl leads as to the identity of other persons
who now the applicant well. Persons are in-
terviewed who reside in the neighborhood where
the applicant has lived. If the individual has
been in the service these records are examined.
Credit records of the applicant are reviewed as
well as appropriate police agencies to determine
if he has a local criminal record. Finally the
applicant himself may be interviewed, if neces-
sary, to clarify any unaccounted for time in his
life which does not show up readily in the in-
vestigation. In a number of instances special
inquiries will be required, as for instance in cases
where the applicant has resided in a foreign
country.
Now the next question is what constitutes de-
rogatory information. Derogatory information
for the purposes of the security program is de-
ﬁned in the criteria established by the Executive
order. This order, in addition to the factors re-
lating to subversive activity or association, in-
cludes behavior characteristics which reﬂect on
the reliability and trustworthiness of an individ-
ual—the misrepresentation, falsiﬁcation, or omis-
sion of material facts—criminal, infamous, or
notoriously disgraceful conduct, perversion,
drunkenness—drug addiction and adjudication
of insanity—or facts which furnish reason to be-
lieve an employee may be subjected to coercion,
inﬂuence, or pressure which would cause him to
act contrar to the national security interest.
Having o tained as much background informa-
tion as is available through investigative means
we then assign the ﬁle to the Evaluation Unit 0
the Security Ofﬁce. This unit very carefully
studies the information. It endeavors to pro'ect
a future judgment as to the security potentia of
the individual.
You will observe that this system is in no way
analogous to our court system since we are not
trying to prove anyone is ilty of violating a
law. That is the business 0 the Justice Depart-
ment. If our investigation discloses the possi-
bility that anyone is violating a law or that an
individual poses a possible threat to the Nation’s
security we must turn the matter over to the
Justice bepartment because the FBI is charged
with the responsibility for investigating viola-
tions of the laws of the United States and for the
primary res onsibility of protecting the internal
security of t e United States.
It is not our function to compile evidence for
presentation in court cases. On the contrary we
are collecting information on which to base a
judgment as to the security potential of the
1nd1vidual.
Bale Llnos ot Pulley
In rojecting this judgment we have certain
basic ines of olicy laid down by the President.
The ﬁrst of t ese is that no American can assert
a right to Government employment. Government
employment is a privilege and a high honor; con-
sequently the Government as an employer can and
does establish standards just as any private em-
plo er may do.
'the second broad policy statement of President
Eisenhower is that the American people are en-
titled to a Government whose clear qualities are
loyalty, security, eﬁiciency, economy, and integ-
rity. In the President’s view “only a combina-
tion of both loyalty and reliability promises genu-
ine security.”
The third eneral policy line is set forth in the
President’s xecutive order. Our evaluation
must afﬁrm that the individual’s employment in
the Federal Service is “clearly consistent with the
interests of the National security,” and further
that reasonable doubt as to this clear consistency
will be resolved in favor of the Government.
This evaluation of the security information,
this matter of forming a judgment as to future
action, is, of course, not susceptible to present
proof. The future may disclose that the present
judgment was unwarranted, but we have no way
of foreseeing this circumstance. We do have the
obligation to take such precaution as may be ex-
pected of reasonable and prudent men to protect
the Government from exposure to danger.
