North Atlantic Council
Holds Twelfth Session
TEXT OF FINAL COMMUNIQUE'
1. The North Atlantic Council, meeting in
Paris in Ministerial Session under the Chairman-
shi of the French Foreign Minister, M. Georges
Bidhult, completed its work today.
2. The Council examined the international situ-
ation and views were exchanged on matters of
common concern, including Soviet policy. The
Council concluded that there had been no evidence
of any change in ultimate Soviet objectives and
that it remained a principal Soviet aim to bring
about the disintegration of the Atlantic Alliance.
While the Soviet Government had yet to show
that it genuinely desired to reach agreement on
any of the outstanding points of difference
throughout the world, the policy of NATO is to
seek solutions to roblems by peaceful means.
The Council there ore welcomed the steps taken
by the Governments of France, the United King-
dom and the United States in their recent ex-
changes of notes with the Soviet Government to
bring about an early meetin of the four Foreign
Minlsters in Berlin. The ouncil also warmly
endorsed the initiative taken by the President of
the United States in placing before the United
Nations pro osals for developing and expediting
the peacefu use of atomic energy and bringing
together the Powers principally involved in order
to seek a solution to the problem of atomic arm-
aments.2
3. The Council reaffirmed its conviction that
peace and security must be the paramount aim
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It
recognised that the increasing stren th and unity
of the North Atlantic Powers, which must be
steadily reinforced, had proved to be decisive
factors in maintaining peace and preventing
aggression. Nevertheless, the threat to the West-
ern world remains and member countries must be
ready to face a continuance of this threat over a
long period. The Atlantic Community must
therefore be prepared to keep in being over a
period of years forces and weapons which will be
a major factor in deterring aggression and in
contributing to the effective security of the NATO
area, and which member countries can afford while
at the same time maintaining and strengthening
their economic and social structures. Improve-
ments must continually be sought in the quality of
NATO forces and to ensure that they have equip-
ment which is always up-to-date so that, in the
event of attack, they can act as a shield behind
which the full strength of the member countries
can be rapidly mobilised. .
Within the continuously developing framework
of the Atlantic Community the institution of the
European Defence Community, including a Ger-
man contribution, remains an essential objective
for the reinforcement of the defensive strength
of the Alliance.
4. The Council considered the Report on the
Annual Review for 1953 which records the pro -
ress in the NATO defence eﬁ'ort particular y
during the ast year. At its meeting in December
1952, the ouncil laid emphasis on the develop-
ment of the effectiveness of the forces.8 In this
respect notable progress has been made. Large
quantities of new equipment have been provided
to the forces. This has enabled, in particular,
many new support units to be built up. The goals
established for the current year have been com-
pletely met for the land forces and to a substan-
tial extent for the naval and air forces.
5. On the basis of recommendations made in the
Report, the Council adopted ﬁrm force goals for
1954, provisional goals for 1955, and planning
goals for 1956. The force goals agreed upon for
1954 envisaged some increase in the numerical
strength of existing NATO forces and a very sub-
stantial improvement in their quality and effec-
tiveness.
6. It was agreed that special attention should be
given to the continuing provision of modern weap-
ons of the latest types to support the NATO de-
fence system.
The Council noted with satisfaction the inten-
tion of the President of the United States of
America to ask Congress for authority to provide
information on nuclear weapons to NATO com-
manders for purposes of NATO military plan-
ning.‘

‘Sccretary of Defense Charles E. Wilson, addressing
the Ministers on Dec. 15, had announced the President's
intention. At his press conference in Washington on
Dec. 16, the President replied as follows to a question on
the subject:
“There are certain changes in the law that are neces
sary before America can realize the full value with its
allies out of the development that has been going on since
the World War in this ﬁeld, this weapons ﬁeld.
“Now, there are no changes contemplated by me or by
the Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission that
have anything to do with the scientiﬁc processes of nu-
clear ﬁssion or building of weapons or building of any-
thing else. But where we are attempting to assure the
integrity of a line, where we feel that our interest re-
quires to hold it, it is simply foolish for us to think that
we cannot or must not share. some kind of our information
with our allies who would be dependent upon the same
kind of support of this kind as we will.
“In other words, it is a very limited ﬁeld, but certain
revisions of the law are necessary before we can do any-
thing, because you must remember that the law was passed
under conditions that are not even remotely resembling
what they are now."
