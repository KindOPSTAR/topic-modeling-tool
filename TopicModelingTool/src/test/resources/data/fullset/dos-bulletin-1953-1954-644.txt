HIGHLIGHTS OF
LATIN AMERICAN ARCHEOLOGY '
Every year at this period, throu bout the
American Republics, inter-American so idarity is
celebrated, and our 21 Republics call to mind the
fundamental likenesses underlying our diﬂ'erences.
Certainly it is salutary for us all to keep fresh in
mind the great relationships of origin, tradition,
and history that linked us in the eras of discovery,
colonization, and independence; the obli ations
and rewards of voluntary association which we
share today; and the unlimited promise of our
mutual future.
However, in recalling and commemorating these
aspects of our inter-American relationships, we
usually, and naturally, dwell most on the inspiring
story of how our 21 Republics achieved their in-
dependence and their present status as nations,
against the common background of a European
past, prevailingly Spanish, English, Portuguese,
or French. We often forget that other great her-
itage, the pre-Colombian cultures, has also had
great cultural inﬂuence on all our nations.
Latin American archeolo as high-lighted in
these exhibits will help set t e record straight. I
am informed that 2 million and more persons visit
the Smithsonian every year. That vast number
henceforward has the way made easy for observ-
ing and appreciating our pre-Colombian heritage.
I am happy that an institution so well known
in Latin America as the Smithsonian has under-
taken this ﬁne work. In many countries of the
hemisphere scientists of the Smithsonian have
worked in close cooperation with colleagues in
their host country.
Clvlllutlon of Pre-Colomblln Man
Whatever gaps in knowledge may still exist,
and there are many, one thing about pre~Colom-
bian man in America is proved beyond all doubt.
People who were living in America in 1492 and
had been living here for thousands of years p0s~
sessed complex, highly developed civilizations of
their own. Proofs of that fact surround us here
today. As we view this astonishing, this truly
magniﬁcent cumulative record of such rich and
various cultures, we can comprehend the amaze-

ment with which 15th century Europe reacted to
a New \Vorld thronged with wonders.
At whatever point the European ﬁrstcomers
touched the Indies—our Americas—discover of
countless things new and strange awaited t em
whether in Peru, Mexico, or Guatemala.
In fact, I ﬁnd one of the most interesting aspects
about this exhibition is that it covers every coun-
try in the hemisphere and yet no part of it is con-
ﬁned to any one country. The oint here is ob-
vious: The cultures of people 0 not recognize
artiﬁcial boundaries and it is right that this should
be so. Nations may be justly roud of their con-
tributions to civilization but hey will not try to
keep those contributions from reaching other
petiple.
' his exhibition in its own right is a valuable
expression of the results of many years of patient
and painstaking work in exploration and recon-
struction of the origins of our people. It is even
more a symbol of the determination of the eople
of the United States to know its neighbors better.
Following his visit to the South American
countries last year, Dr. Eisenhower pointed out
that one of our most important tasks was to create
better understanding among the peo le of the
American Republics. As he noted in is Report
to the President:‘ “Abiding cooperation among
nations toward common goals must be based on
genuine understanding and mutual respect.” We
might well resolve all the political problems that
plague the oung, burgeonin nations of this
emisphere, ut there would sti 1 be no ﬁrm foun-
dation for living in our community of nations if
oUr people did not understand one another. We
must know each other’s past, our present ways of
life and our aspirations, national and inter-
national.
Need tor Cultural Undentandlng
It was for this reason that my government at-
tached great importance to im roving the Con-
vention for the Promotion 0? Inter-American
Cultural Relations at the Tenth Inter-American
Conference which recently ended at Caracas. It
was for these reasons that we resented to the
Conference a number of resolutions desi ed to
increase cultural interchange among us. e lent
our full support to every resolution that appeared
to hold out the hope of furthering interchange of
knowledge and skills among us. We shall con~
tinue to do all in our power to stimulate ways to
bring about mutual appreciation of our nations
and people, wherever possible increasing our cul-
tural relations program with the other American
Republics.
