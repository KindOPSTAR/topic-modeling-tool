Press release 45 dated February 2
The De )artment of State has now completed an
investigation of the allegation referred to the De-
partment of State b the Senate Permanent Sub-
committee on Investigation on July 10, 1953.
hAn evaluation of this investigation indicates
t at:
1. There is no information indicating that repre-
sentatives of a friendly foreign power sought
recognition by offering a bribe, or in any way con-
ducted themselves in an unethical or illegal
manner.
2. There is no information indicating that any
employee of the State Department either accepted
a bribe, or solicited a bribe, or was in any way en-
gaged in wron ful, illegal, or unethical conduct in
connection wit 1 this matter.
The Department’s inquiry into the Senate Com-
mittee‘s report was conﬁned to the issues of al-
leged misconduct on the part of a friendly foreign
power, or on the part of employees of the De art-
ment. These issues are resolved by the a ve
statements (1 and 2). The question of whether or
not a bribe was solicited by other American
citizens is beyond the investigative jurisdiction of
the Department. Information with respect to the
Department’s investigation has been furnished the
Committee. No further comment on this matter
will be forthcoming from the Department.

Press release 52 dated February 4
John Hvasta, an American citizen who had been
imprisoned in Czechoslovakia from October 16,
1948, until his escape from prison on January 2,
1952,‘ has now left Prague on his way to the
United States.

notiﬁed the Czechoslovak Government and started
negotiations to enable him to leave Czechoslovakia.
U.S. Ambassador U. Alexis Johnson continued
these negotiations from the moment he presented
his credentials December 31, 1953. On February
3, 1954, he reached an agreement whereb Iivasta
would be placed in the technical custodyv of the
Czechoslovak authorities for one day or less
with an Embassy otlicer present at all times, so
that proceedings under Czechoslovak law for com-
muting the sentence could be completed. Accord-
ingly, on February 4, 1954, First Secretary of
Embassy John D. Iams accompanied Hvasta to
the Ministry of Interior where the sentence was
commuted to expulsion from Czechoslovakia. The
same day Hvasta left Prague for Nurember ac-
companied by Counselor of Embassy Nat 'ing
and First Secretary Iams.
Hvasta had been sentenced to 3 ears im rison-
ment by the State Court at Bratis ava on . une 1,
1949, on charges of espionage. On April 25, 1950,
his case was reviewed b the Czechoslovak Su-
preme Court at Prague m a secret trial and his
sentence was increased at that time to 10 ears.
The Department is gratiﬁed that Mr. vasta is
now able to be reunited with his parents and
brother in the United States after this long and
tragic separation. It is also pleased that the long
an persistent efforts on the part of this Govern-
ment to obtain freedom for Mr. Hvasta, whose
imprisonment it has always considered unjustiﬁed,
have now reached a successful conclusion.
Charges of Intervention
In Guatemala Denied
Press release 42 dated January 30
The Department of State has today received
a summary of the statement issued yesterday by
the Presidential Information Ofﬁce of Guatemala
charging that the U.S. Government had ac uiesced
in a plot by other nations against Guatema a. The
charge is ridiculous and untrue. It is the licy
of the United States not to intervene in t 1e in-
ternal affairs of other nations. That policy has
repeatedly been reaﬂirmed under the present ad-
ministration.
It is notable that the charge comes as the climax
of an increasingly mendacious propaganda cam-
paign and of attacks on freedom of expression and
democratic labor organization in Guatemala.
This is perhaps connected with the recent change
in the Guatemalan Foreign Ministry and with the
return from visits to the Soviet Union and Iron
Curtain countries of Victor Manuel Gutierrez
and Jose Manuel Fortuny, the former a no-
torious Communist and leader of the Communist-
dominated labor confederation (Com), the latter
