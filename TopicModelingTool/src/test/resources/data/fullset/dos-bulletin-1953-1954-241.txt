Response by Preeldent Beyer
[Translation]
Mr. President, I am deeply moved by the warm
reception and the manifestations of genuine
friendslii which I have experienced since I set
foot on merican soil.
I am particularly happy, as your est this
evening, to enjoy your solicitous hospita ity in this
legendary residence.
The emotion that I felt on listening to your
kind words about in country was not only stirred
by the sincere fee ings which you so well ex-
pressed, but it was also due to the fact that I
realized how well this country understood the
revolution which has taken place in my country
since the day that, under the leadership of one
of her sons devoted to the cause of civilization and
humanit , she changed her destiny until the day
she won ier place in the community of free coun-
tries and assumed her duties in the service of
humanity.
There is no doubt that the words that you, a
great general and outstanding statesman, have
spoken as the hi hest authority of the great Amer-
ican nation, wil be a source of endless joy to all
my countrymen.
I also wish to thank you for your kind and grat-
ifying words about myself. As you have said,
I do in fact cherish the moral satisfaction of hav-
ing worked to ether from the ﬁrst day to the last,
With Kemal taturk, the savior of my country,
the founder of modern Turkey, and the architect
of the Turkish Revolution.
But the oup who rallied under Ataturk and
who were t en called “the national force,” are a
symbol of the Turkish nation who pinned their
destiny on him in the cause of a free and inde-
pendent Turkish land, and for the ideal of a free
and independent world according to the highest
human concepts.
Today, these goals of the Turkish nation have
been attained. Turke shares the responsibility
of a common fate wit those nations of the free
world who are makin sacriﬁces for their liberty
and independence. he happiest manifestation
of that is in the ﬁrm ties which bind our two coun-
tries to each other.
I am very proud to hear that your Government
has decided to confer upon me the Legion of Merit,
which is the highest award given in time of
peace to a foreign citizen, in recognition of his
services.
I accept this great honor, fully conscious of its
worth, as a valuable token of the friendshi of
the American people towards my nation, w ich
atfhe moment I represent on friendly American
sm .
Turkey considers it a human and national duty
to cooperate with the peoples who are strivin
for the realization of the ideals of a free worl
and genuine peace. No matter how strenuous and
dark may be the road that leads to that objective,
she is determined to walk hand in hand with her
allies. For the Turkish nation, liberty is the
mainstay of life. And I am convinced that the
souls of the Turkish and American nations ﬁnd
communion on that motto above everything else.
When, therefore, our sons shake each other’s
hand on the road on which our countries are de-
termined to walk arm in arm, they feel the mutual
determination and conﬁdence of two great s irits.
I raise my glass to your health, and to the ealth
of Mrs. Eisenhower. I drink to the ha iness
asnd prosperity of our great ally, the nited
tates.
Improvements in
Austrian Economy
Austria’s economic recovery since World War
II has progreSsed so well, because of the effective
combination of the productive energies of her own
people and U.S. economic assistance, that no
direct aid from the United States is re uired dur-
in the current ﬁscal year, the Foreign perations
A ministration announced on January 4. This
development is yet another indication of the grow-
ing economic strength in Western Europe.
The achievements of the Austrian Government,
together with those of the other free nations of
the world, made 1953 the best year economically
since the end of World War II. As a result, there
will be less need for U.S. economic aid in most
Western European countries during the forth-
coming ear. This very satisfactory situation
testiﬁes ramatically to the achievements of free
nations of the world working cooperatively to
each other’s mutual beneﬁt.
The improvements in the Austrian economy are
the best testimony to the success of the cooperative
Austrian and U.S. rograms for the recovery of
that nation. For instance, Austrian gold and
dollar reserves climbed from $85 million in 1949
to more than $200 million by October 1953. Ex-
ports increased from $22 million in 1946 to $387
million for the ﬁrst 9 months of 1953. Industrial
production, based on a 1948 index of 100, had
climbed to an estimated 182 in 1953.
The Austrian Government in continuing pro-
grams to increase industrial and agricultural
productivity will receive American technical
assistance to support these programs.
Since the start of the Marshall plan in 1948, the
Austrian Government has received a total of $960
million, of which $727 million was direct aid.
Large-scale aid has been declining steadily, as
Austria’s own war-stricken economy recovered.
For instance, in the ﬁrst 15 months of the program,
Austria received a total of $342 million of which
$280 million was direct aid. In contrast, during
the last ﬁscal year U.S. aid dropped to less than
$50 million.
