The United States and Charter Review
by David W. Wainlzouse
Deputy Assistant Secretary for United Nations Aﬂ'aira‘
Since you may have already arrived at some
conclusions regarding charter review, I am going
to ask your indulgence if I go back a few steps to
some of the prior considerations out of which con-
clusions grow.
I ask your indulgence in the hope that you may
see in my remarks some touchstones against which
to test your own thinking. I will therefore try to
state some of the eneral considerations which
underlie the State epartment’s thinking on this
subject.
I will not attempt to discuss in any detail the
particular problem areas which are of especial in-
terest to the Department of State. I am sure you
are fully aware that Secretary Dulles in his testi-
mon on January 18 before the subcommittee of
the enate Foreign Relations Committee ’ identi-
ﬁed some of the issues, such as universality of
membership, security arran ements, votin in the
Security Council and the Ggeneral Assemgly, the
development of international law, and the ques-
tion of domestic jurisdiction, which may come
befgre any review conference and thereby merit
stu .
AISiy ﬁnal positions taken by the United States
Government must await the crystallization of the
view of the American peo 1e. There will have to
be a careful assessment 0 the attitudes of other
member states. We will rely heavily upon the
advice'of Congress. And certainly the views and
recommendations of numerous private organiza-
tions and institutes such as yours devoting their
attention to a study of charter review problems
will receive our most careful consideration. The
deﬁnitive conclusions will not come until the dem-
ocratic processes have resulted in a more recog-
nizable consensus within our country.
You will note that I use the ex ression “review
of the Charter” rather than I‘BVISiOIl or amend-
ment. I stress the word review because we should

not start on the premise that the charter is to be
amended in a certain way, or necessarily amended
at all. The U.S. representative made this per-
fectly clear at the Eighth General Assembl .
The General Assembly will hold its tent ses-
sion in 1955. Present indications are that a
majority of the United Nations membership an-
tici ate that a charter review conference Will be
hel . A large majority at the recent Eighth As-
sembly session in 1953 recommended to the United
Nations Secretariat that it complete certain pre-
aratory work prior to the review conference.
his is to consist of the publication of some un-
published documents of the ori inal San Francisco
conference in 1945, a survey 0 the precedents set
by the United Nations organs in their operations
under the charter, and a comprehensive index to
the legislative history of the charter.
Justiﬁcation for Charter Revlon
Secretary Dulles said in his speech of January
18 that the United States “expects to favor the
holding of a review conference.” It seems to me
that the case for charter review is cleareut for
two principal reasons:
First, it is a matter of simple ood faith for
the United States to sup ort the oldin of the
review conference. At an Francisco in 1945
some rovisions were adopted over rather strong
oppomtion on the part of many, particularly the
smaller states. They adopted the Charter on the
assumption that they would be given an oppor-
tunity to reexamine the charter provisions after
a 10-year trial. At San Francisco the United
States indicated that it would support the hold-
ing of such a conference after a period of 10 years.
If a majority of the member states desire a
charter review conference, we should certainly
sup ort it.
T e second reason involves American leadership
in the setting of contemporary world olitics.
The world has been divided by “iron” an “bam-
boo” curtains. There is a trend toward bipo-
