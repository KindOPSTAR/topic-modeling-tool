the necessary data for the allocation of the quan-
tities in question.
Export Control
The quantities of tin which might be exported
from the producing countries would be determined
by the Council from time to time. The Council
would have the duty of adjusting su ply to de-
mand so as to maintain the price 0? tin metal
within the stabilization range. It would try also
to maintain tin and cash in the buffer stock ade-
quate to rectify an discrepancies between supply
and demand whic might arise through un ore-
seen circumstances.
The Council would estimate, not less than once
every 3 months, the probable demand for tin dur-
ing a following period of 3 calendar months and
the robable increase or decrease of commercial
stoc s during that period. In the li ht of these
estimates, the quantity of tin in the uﬁer stock,
the current price, and any other relevant factors,
the Council would be authorized to ﬁx a total er-
missible export amount for the control peri of
3 calendar months, by a majority of the votes cast
by consuming countries and a majority of the votes
cast by producin countries. A 0 such limitation
of exports could ecome eﬁective unless the buﬁ'er
stock held at least 10,000 tons of tin metal or the
Council found by concurrent majorities, counted
separately, that 10,000 tons was likely to be held
before the end of the control period.
A total ermissible export amount for an con-
trol period) would be divided among the p ucing
countries in proportion to their percentages speci-
ﬁed in annex A or the revisions of those percent-
ages which might be made in accordance with the
agreement. The Council would determine by
concurrent majorities, counted separately, the per-
centage for any country which acceded to the
agreement as a producing country.
The percentage of each producing country would
be reduced by 1Amth at the end of each ear. The
agreement authorizes the Council to rea locate this
proportion among the producing countries to af-
fOI‘( increasing opportunities for satisfying
national consumption and world market require-
ments in the most eﬂective and economic manner.
The Council would, of course, give due regard to
the need for preventin serious economic and
social dislocation and to t e position of producing
areas suﬁerin from abnormal disabilities. If a
reallocation failed to obtain the necessary majority
of the votes cast by consumin countries and
ma'ority of the votes cast by roducing countries,
eac producing country woul have the same per-
centage as it had before the l/zoth reduction.
Each producing country would be obligated to
take such measures as were necessary to make its
exports correspond as closely as possible to its
permissible export amount for any control period.
If the net exports of tin from a producing coun-
try were less than 95 percent of the aggregate of
its permissible export amounts for four successive
control eriods in which permissible ex rt
amounts ad been ﬁxed, the Council would reggce
the percentage of that country proportionately
unless satisﬁed that the shortfall was due to fac-.
tors beyond the control of the country and that
such shortage was unlikely to recur.
If the net exports from any producing country-
exceeded its permissible amount by more than 5.
percent in any control period, the Council might
require the country to make an additional contri-.
bution to the buffer stock uivalent to the amount
of the excess. The Counci would decide whether-
the contribution should be made in tin metal or in.
cash, with cash being deemed equivalent to the
quantity of metal it would purchase at the current
oor price.
If the aggregate net exports from a producing
country exceeded the aggregate of its rmissible
amounts in any four successive contro riods in
which permissible export amounts had 11 ﬁxed,
the percentage of the country would be reduced
for 1 year by a fraction pro rtional to the excess
or, if the Council so decide by concurrent major~
ities, counted separately, by any greater fraction
not exceeding twice that of the excess. If the
aggregate net exports from the country exceeded
the aggregate of its permissible amounts in four
further successive riods for which permissible
export amounts had)6 been ﬁxed, the Council could
also declare that the country should forfeit a por-
tion of its rights to articipate in the liquidation
of the buffer stock. is forfeiture would not ex-
ceed one-half of such rights on the ﬁrst occasion.
The Council could at any time restore these rights
to_ the country on terms and conditions as deter~
mined.
The a cement provides that stocks of tin with-
in a pro ucing country shall not, with some speci~
ﬁed exce tions, exceed 25 percent of the net
Lessons 0 the country during the 12 months pre-
ing the date on which the control of exports.
comes into effect.
Amendments and Suspenslon
The article on amendments and suspension r0-
vides that amendments of the agreement coul be
recommended to contracting governments by the
Council if supported by two-thirds of the producer
votes and two-thirds of the consumer votes. The
Council would ﬁx the period of time within which
each contracting government should give notice
regarding its acceptance of an amendment. An
amendment would take effect immediately if ac-
cepted by all participating countries within that
time; if it was accepted by overnments holding
all of the producer votes and y those holding two-
thirds of the consumer votes, it would become eﬁ'ec-
tive for those countries 3 months after notiﬁcation
