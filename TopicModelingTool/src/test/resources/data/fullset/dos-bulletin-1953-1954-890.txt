admit that the present differences, coupled with
present voting rocedures, impair the utility of
the United Nations as an active body. But this
could be remedied without constantly reducing
membership as a means to gain efﬁciency.
It is important to have a world forum, where
differences which actually exist in the world are
made apparent and can be judged.
So long as nations are ginniner independent
and have governments w 'ch do not Violently
ﬂout the eaceful principles of the United Nations,
then I t ink they should be part of a world
organization.
That the United Nations can set forces in mo-
tion was shown in Korea. There, for the ﬁrst
time in history, an international or anization ac-
tually acted to meet aggression an to throw it
back. Sixteen members joined with the Republic
of Korea to ﬁght until the aggressors had been
thwarted and the situation was such that the
United Nations felt that it had achieved those
objectives which justiﬁed the use of force. en
the United States, acting on behalf of the United
Nations, ne otiated an armistice. Now, at
Geneva, we ave joined with the Republic of
Korea and others to seek a peace which will unify
Korea in freedom.
The Communist aggressor group insist, how-
ever, that any solution shall be on terms which
exclude the United Nations as being itself a
wrongdoer because it o posed their aggression.
I do not believe that t is is an issue which should
be compromised. Many men from many lands
have gone to Korea and have died there in battle.
They did so, not because their nations had been
s eciﬁcally pledged to defend Korea, but because
orea symbolized a principle of universal appli-
cation. They sought to develop the authority and
resti e of the United Nations as an international
orce or the peace, security, and justice of all.
The Korean War had better not been fought if
in the end the aggressors and their accomplices
succeed at Geneva in besmirching the honor and
prestige of the United Nations.

A second political matter which toda causes
much concern is the war in Indochina. T ere, the
State of Viet-Nam is the prey of violent forces of
rebellion, promoted and equipped from without.
The States of Laos and Cambodia have been in-
vaded, and Thailand is threatened.
It may be asked why this situation has not be-
fore now been brought to the United Nations. I
can assure you that this ignoring of the United
Nations was not the choice of the United States.
Now, I am glad to say, Thailand, one of the
members of the United Nations, has taken its situ-
936
ation to the United Nations and has asked the
Security Council to send a peace observation com-
mission to the area. Thailand has our strong
support in this matter. Last week the Security
Council placed the matter on its a enda by a vote
glf 10 to 1, the sole dissent coming grom the Soviet
mon.
It has been suggested that an afﬁrmative re- _
sponse to Thailand’s appeal might in some way
impede the negotiations at Geneva with reference
to possible eace in Indochina. That argument
has little va idity. A peace observation commis-
sion has no authority to make decisions. It is a
reporting body. It is the e es and ears of the
world communit . It is di cult to see why the
negotiations at eneva would be impeded by the
fact that representatives of the United Nations
were in the area reporting what was oing on.
Knowledge has never yet been an impediment to
honest negotiation.
COLONIALISM
There is another aspect of the United Nations
Charter to which I would refer. That is its Decla-
ration favoring increasing self-government b de-
pendent peoples. This provision and the re ated
provisions on trusteeship were largely a product
of United States effort.
It was natural that the United States should
have taken a lead in this matter. We ourselves are
the ﬁrst colony in modern times to have won in-
dependence. We have a natural sympathy with
those everywhere who would follow our exam le.
When the fortunes of war gave the United
States responsibilities in relation to non-self-gov-
erning peoples, such as in Cuba and the Philip-
pines, we qgickly went about the business of
eveloping ll self-government in total freedom.
Puerto Rico is already self-governing, within our
political system, and President Eisenhower has
said he would seek its complete independence if it
would prefer to go its separate way.
During recent years, Communist propaganda
has concentrated on efforts to portray the United
States as an imperialist colonialist power. The
charge is based upon our close and friendly asso-
ciation with Great Britain, France, and other
Western European powers, which have been, and
to some extent still are, colonial powers.
However, it should not be forgotten that during
the last 9 years the Western colonial powers have
given effect to the United Nations Charter pledge
to the extent of granting complete political inde-
pendence to over 600 million people now constitut-
ing 10 independent nations. Those who most
loudly attack “colonialism” have themselves, dur-
ing this same 9-year period, extended their despot-
ism to over 600 million people, and deprived all or
part of 11 once free nations of any semblance of
genuine independence.
