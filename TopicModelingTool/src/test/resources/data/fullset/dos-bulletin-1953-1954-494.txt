we are signing today is that they represent the
beliefs, both of the Japanese and American nego-
tiators, that their signature will be in the mutual
interest of both our countries. These agreements
require our countries to assume mutual o ligations
but the give our countries mutual beneﬁts.
The nvestment Guarantee Agreement will not
solve Japan’s economic problems but it will help
in a modest way to encourage American capital
to come to Ja an to build up your industr , pro-
vide more jo s for your workers, and evelop
more exports to pay for the imports you must
have. T at is your ain. Our beneﬁt is not only
proﬁt for individual; ﬁrms, but, more important,
it represents a further step toward making the
Japanese economy strong, healthy, and inde end-
ent of outside assistance or special ollar
ex enditures.
he Purchase Agreement under section 5502
and the companion Economic Arrangements
Agreement likewise serve both our interests. Un-
der them 500,000 tons of surplus wheat and 100,-
000 tons of surplus barley which our farmers and
a bountiful nature have roduced, will be sold
on terms advantageous to a an and without cost
to you in dollars. One of t e beneﬁts is that it
will help to tide you over the cons uences of last
year’s rlce crop failure and ﬂood isaster. The
yen which you pay us for this wheat will be
turned back to Japan to help build up your de-
fense industries and to purchase goods which will
enable the Japanese people and other free eoples
to defend themselves a ainst the threat 0? Com-
munist im erialism. 'Iilius these two agreements
also serve 0th our national interests.
The Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement is,
of course, the basic one. Since negotiations were
commenced last July there has been much public
and press discussion and debate in Japan about
this agreement That is good. It is only as a
result of public discussion and debate that govern-
ments of free peoples can successfully hammer out
these policies which are in their own interest. It
is only the totalitarian governments which feel
they can make a reements and establish funda-
mental policies w'ithout the consent of the people
as voiced by their elected representatives.
However, in spite of the public discussion given
to this subject, I am afraid there is still in some
quarters misunderstanding and a reluctance to
accept the plain facts of the case. In spite of
what has been and is still being said, you will look
in vain for any requirement in the Mutual Defense
Assistance Agreement that Japan send its young
men abroad. You will look in vain for any re-
quirement that Japan take any action to which its
Government does not of its own free will agree.
Let me quote again from a statement by Secretary
of State Dulles made just before our negotiations

opened last July and which I referred to in my
remarks at that time. In speaking of the mutual
security program for J a an, Secretary Dulles said
that it won (1 be “pure y of a defensive nature,
directed exclusively toward contributin to the
defense and internal security of the apanese
homeland”.a
Another prevalent misconception is that by
signing this agreement Japan subordinates eco-
nomic rehabilitation of its people to a purely mili-
tary eﬁ'ort. Here again let me recall what I
pointed out 8 months ago when I quoted President
‘isenhower‘s message of May 5 last year in which
he presented the mutual security program to the
Congress. The President stressed certain con-
clusions about this program which I believe are
fundamental and of great importance. He said: ‘
The United States and our partners throughout the
world must stand ready, for many years it necessary, to
build and maintain adequate defenses.
To accomplish this objective we must avoid so rapid
a military buildup that we seriously dislocate our econo-
mies. Military strength is most eﬂective—indeed it can
be maintained—only if it rests on a solid economic base.
We must help the free nations to help themselves in
eradicating conditions which corrode and destroy the
will for freedom and democracy from within.
I felt it necessary, Mr. Minister, to recall these
previous statements in order to make clear that
America’s purpose in concluding these agreements
has been consistent and enlightened. In a s eciﬁc
sense these agreements are for the urpose 0 help-
ing Japan undertake a lar er s are of its own
defense. This agreement ta es us one step nearer
the time when the Japanese people will not need
to rely on American forces for protection. It takes
us one ste nearer the time when the United States
can with raw its forces from Japan. The great-
est contribution Japan can make to the security
of the free world is to strengthen her own security
and be in a position to assure her own people that
they will be able to live and develop their own
ideas and their own culture in their own way and
not become subject to an alien dictatorship. A
strong, free, and enlightened Japan can contribute
much to the peace and stability of Asia and the
world. It is my belief that these agreements we
are sip-ning today will contribute toward the build-
lng 0 suc 1 8. Japan.
t is also important, I believe, to point out that
this a reement is not unique, but that in signing
it the Japanese Government is following a pattern
already set by man countries in all parts of the
world. The Unite States has entered into these
agreements in order to assist in building up eco-
nomic power and defensive strength of friendly
nations. Slowly but surely—through their own
efforts and with some help from us—the nations
which treasure their national independence are
strengthening their economic foundations and
creating the means of defending themselves
