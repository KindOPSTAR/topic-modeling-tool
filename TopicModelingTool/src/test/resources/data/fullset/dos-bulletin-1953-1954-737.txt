to defend its independence, the Government of
Ira linked this obJective W1th the defense of the
vittii resources of the free world. The request of
the Government of Iraq has now been favorably
acted upon by the United States and an under-
standing reached. The President’s statement of
February 251 gives general background on the
subject of United States policy with respect to
U.S. military assistance to certain countries of the
Near and Middle East.
The understanding reached between the two
Governments was effected by an exchange of notes
in Baghdad on April 21. Included in the under-
standing is a provision that “assistance will be
provided subject to the provisions of applicable
legislative authority and will be related in char-
acter, timing and amount to international develop-
ments in the area.”
