osal and the safeguards of existing treaties with-
in which it would operate, it is not conceivable
that the declaration could be used for other than
its intended purpose. I refer particularly to the
admirable addresses of the Brazilian and
Colombian Forei Ministers. The U.S. proposal
does not and obviously cannot enlarge or change
in any way existing treaties.
The U. S. proposal, as submitted, is a foreign
policy declaration directed against those in non-
American lands who 0 erate the subversive ap-
paratus of internationa communism. They have
used that apparatus to gain control over 800 mil-
lion persons, to blot out inde endence in 15 nations
in Europe and Asia, and they demonstrably are
utting that apparatus into use against this hem-
1s here. We would warn them that we are aware
0 their design, that we oppose it, and that they
cannot expect to gain a real success within this
hemisphere because, if they should get control
of any American State, we would all unite to
deprive them of the fruits of their aggression and
to restore the sovereignty and political independ-
egce to the American State that had been robbed
o it.
Our proposed declaration in this sense is, I
repeat, a foreign- olicy declaration. Our admo-
nitions are not ad ressed to any one of our Repub-
lics or to the Western Hemisphere.
Proposed U. 5. Amendment
The delegations of Argentina and Mexico have
suggested some verbal changes which they believe
make this aspect of the declaration more clear.
It seems to us, however, that the ap rehension
expressed comes not primarily from t e present
text but from historical fears and that the better
and more adequate way to meet them is to add to
the declaration as drafted by the United States
innadditional paragraph which would read as
o ows:
This declaration of foreign policy made by the American
Republics in relation to dangers originating outside this
Hemisphere is designed to protect and not to impair the
inalienable right of each American State freely to choose
its own form of government and economic system and
to live its own social and cultural life.
Such a sup lement to the declaration proposed
b the Unite States will, we believe, dispose of
a l the fears which have been expressed. Certain
proposals have been made by the Mexican delega-
tion which are unacceptable to the United States
because they would, in our opinion, basically
alter the concept of the declaration and turn it
from a foreign-policy declaration into a declara-
tion of domestic import. These Mexican amend-
ments fall under four headings:
1. They would, in general, substitute'the words,
“agents of foreign international communism,”
where the U.S. proposal speaks only of “interna-
tional communism.” It is of course important
that each of our states should take steps to detect
and eradicate the secret a ents which interna-
tional communism has intro uced into our midst.
Such internal measures were recommended at the
Fourth Meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Af-
fairs. However, it was not the purpose of the
United States to suggest that we should now
merely repeat what was then said. We believe
that we ought to give a simple, clear, and direct
warning to the principals of these secret agents
who for the most part reside in Moscow or satellite
capitals and who from there dominate and direct
the international Communist movement.
It is the fact that we direct our warning to them
that ives the roposed declaration its status as
a dec aration 0 foreign policy. We would be re-
luctant to see our declaration altered so that it was
essentially a doctrine of internal import as it
would be if we directed ourselves only against the
agents here of international communism.
2. It is suggested that we should introduce, at
various points, references to our respective con-
stitutional procedures. This would, of course, be
appropriate if the declaration were designed to
rescribe our own internal conduct. The United
States would, however, be reluctant to adopt lan-
guage which seemed to imply that that was the
purpose of this declaration. Of course each of
us will act in accordance with our constitutional
processes. However, a warning to potential
enemies to keep their hands off of us has nothing
whatever to do with our own domestic constitu-
tional procedures.
3. One of the Mexican amendments would bas-
ically alter what is the heart of the proposed
declaration, namely, that part which says that
the domination or control of the political institutions of
any American State by the international Communist
movement, extending to this Hemisphere the political sys-
tem of an extra-continental power, would constitute a
threat to the sovereignty and political independence of the
American States, endangering the peace of America, and
would call for appropriate action in accordance with
existing treaties.
In place of this clear, recise warning, which all
can understand, the exican delegation would
substitute a legalistic paragraph which attempts
obscurcly to deﬁne what we will do “when” the
political institutions of any American State are
subverted by the intervention of extra-continental
or of any Communist power.
It seems to the United States unthinkable that
the American States should adopt a declaration
dealing with what we shall do “when” one of our
American Republics is made the puppet of inter-
national communism. The whole pur ose of our
declaration is to prevent that from appenin .
A declaration which merely says what we she
do after it has happened would I think, be wholly
unacceptable to most of us. Certainly it is un-
acceptable to the United States.
The United States believes that, as suggested
