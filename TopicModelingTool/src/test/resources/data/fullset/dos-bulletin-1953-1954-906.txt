which were detrimental to United States shipping
interests. In order to resolve these problems in
the interest of United States shipping lines, the
State Department, after consultation with the
three shi ping companies operating to Brazil, de-
vised a our point shipping rogram which was
submitted to the BraZilian overnment in Octo-
ber 1952 and accepted by that Government in
March 1953. As a result, substantial progress
has been made to date in improving this Situation.
The four points of the program and the progress
made are outlined below:
1. The desirability of reestablishing equal treat-
ment in Brazilian ports for United States ships,
and equal treatment in regard to consular fees on
cargo manifests.
Equal treatment in Brazilian orts for shi s of
United States registry was originally established
in Article 1, paragraph one of Decree Law 24511
of June 29, 1934. However, Decree Law 347 of
1938 gave Lloyd Brasileiro vessels preferential
and discriminatory berthing privileges and ex-
clusive warehouse facilities in Brazilian ports.
The Brazilian Government by recent administra-
tive action terminated this preference for Lloyd
Brasileiro vessels. In order to eliminate perma-
nently such preferential treatment it is necessary
for the Brazilian Congress to enact legislation re-
voking Decree Law 347 of 1938.
Article 20 of Decree Law 420 of 1937 provided
for a 50 percent discount on consular fees to ship-
pers using Lloyd Brasileiro vessels. This prac-
tice can only be eliminated by legislation in the
Brazilian Congress.
President Vargas on September 4, 1953, sent a
message to the Brazilian Con ress requesting leg-
islation to permanently cance Decree Law 347 of
1938 and Article 20 of Law 420 of 1937.
2. The need to relieve congestion in Brazilian
ports.
Congestion in Brazilian ports, which costs ship-
ping companies and consumers millions of dollars
annually through increased shipping expenses and
charges, can and is being eliminated in accordance
with s eciﬁc recommendations made by the Joint
United) States-Brazil Economic Develo ment
Commission. This Commission was establis ed to
assist Brazil in its development planning and eco-
nomic rehabilitation.
Brazil has taken a number of steps in improv-
ing conditions in its ports so as to relieve conges-
tion and speed up the turn around time of vessels.
The following are examples :
A. There has been an expansion of the dredging
program in the ports of Rio de Janeiro, Porto
Alegre, Belem, Recife, Salvador, and Cabedelo;
B. The Government of Brazil in increasing the
hours of work of customs ofﬁcers and other port
oﬂicials has considerably shortened the time for-
merly taken to process customs and other docu-
ments.
C. Certain revisions in regulations concerning
the handling of banking documents have been
made, which has contributed to the lessening of
congestion of cargo in the ports;
D. In Rio de J aneiro new piers and warehouses
have been constructed;
E. Penalties have been imposed for use of ware-
houses as storage places over a certain period of
time. This has helped to eliminate warehouse
congestion and facilitates the movement of cargo
to and from the docks;
F. The Brazilian Government undertook a
study of the administration and management of
ort facilities in Rio which resulted in measures
eing put into effect eliminating a great amount
of red tape and speeding up port operations;
G. In Porto Alegre, port congestion has been
great] lessened by administrative reforms insti-
tuted by the Government which did away with
time-consuming bureaucratic requirements;
H. The Government speeded up and completed
the construction of a long awaited oil pipeline in
Santos. This eliminated the need for railway oil
tank cars which were in short su ply, and, as a
result, the storage facilities in t e port are no
longer taxed while waiting for tank cars to carry
the oil inland. Improved methods were also insti-
tuted in the 1158 of railway cars which made os-
sible the availabilit of more cars for the 10 'ng
and unloading of ips.
3. The desirability of Brazilian ﬂag vessels par-
ticipating in the movement to Brazil of cargo ﬁ-
nanced by Export-1m ort Bank loans.
This has been done the United States grant-
ing waivers of Public Resolution No. 17 whereby
Brazilian ﬂag vessels are afforded an opportunity
to participate in moving such cargo to Brazil.
4. The need for additional vessels for Brazil’s
coastwise service. President Vargas has person-
ally requested our assistance on this matter.
The Brazilian Government was informed that
an endeavor would be made to obtain appropriate
legislation authorizing the release of 12 Cl—
MAV—l type vessels from the reserve ﬂeet for
Brazil’s coastal trade.
The present bill under discussion is for this
purpose.
Under the Ship Sales Act of 1946, Brazil pur-
chased 12 vessels of this type. Pursuant to an
application submitted by the Brazilian Govern-
ment, 18 had been set aside for that country but
Brazil did not take delivery of the balance for
various reasons. Brazil also wished to purchase
2 refrigerated vessels of the coastal type but none
of this type were sold to non-citizens.
This bill provides that every vessel sold and
transferred shall be subject to an agreement by the
Government of Brazil that the vessels, whether
under mortgage to the United States or not, shall
not engage in international trade or in other than
