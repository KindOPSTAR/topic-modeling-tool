the statement made by me that about $3.5 billion
was invested abroad by my country in the last 2
years. That is approximately one and three quar-
ters billion per year. He stated that we had made
a proﬁt of $7.5 billion over the last 5 years. Now
that is an average proﬁt of approximately $1.5
billion per year. The point he overlooked however
was that these roﬁts were made on a total invest-
ment of $16 bi ion. This is a return of less than
10 ercent.
n the second lace, he forgot to mention that
more than half 0? these proﬁts were reinvested in
the countries in which they were earned. In each
year since the war, the forei subsidiaries of U.S.
com anies have increased t e proportion of their
foreign earnin which they have retained abroad.
In 1952, this p owback of earnings was 62 percent.
In other words, for every dollar earned m 1952,
from United States direct investment abroad, 62
cents was put back to work to further develop the
economy of the country where the proﬁt was
earned.
Let me give an example of how one U.S. investor
has plowed back its proﬁts for the further eco-
nomic development of the countries in which it
operates. Since 0 ening its ﬁrst store in Habana
in 1941, the Sears oebuck Company has invested
over $28 million in 5 countries in Latin America.
With the exceptiton of one small dividend from
a Cuban subsidiary, every cent of proﬁts earned
between 1941 and 1952 was reinvested in the coun-
tries in which they were earned to ﬁnance new
stores and new products.
I should like to mention another aspect of the
impact of U.S. private investment upon the econo-
mies of foreign countries. In 1950, U.S. direct
investments in all foreign countries contributed to
the foreign exchange receipts of the countries in
which they were located about $2.5 billion in dol-
lar exchange through exports of their products
to the United States. In addition, $400 million
of new direct investment—that is, new dollars, not
reinvested earnings—moved to foreign countries
in the same year. In other words, a total of almost
$3 billion in dollar exchange was made available
to foreign countries in 1950 directly through the
activities of U.S. private investors.
In that same year a total of about $1.2 billion
was transferred by private investors to the United
States. This left a margin of over $1.7 billion
available to foreign countries for the purchase of
capital goods, raw materials, and consumers goods.
This ﬁgure, of course, measures only the direct
dollar gain to foreign countries from United
States private investment. It does not take into
account the many indirect contributions to earn-
ing power and the economic development of these
countries made by such private investment.
The Soviet representative might also be inter-
ested to learn that U.S. investors paid foreign
taxes of more than 30 percent on their foreign
earnings, thereby makin a substantial ﬁnancial
contribution to the deve opment plans of many
of these countries.
Wage Rates Paid by U.S. Flrme
The Soviet representative stated that the wages
paid by American investors in foreign countrles
are considerably lower than the wages paid to
U.S. employees in the same industry. I need only
say that this statement is quite meaningless. If
com arisons are to be made, they should be made
on the basis of wage rates paid by U.S. ﬁrms and
domestic ﬁrms in the same country. The high
wage rates paid by U.S. ﬁrms, both at home and
abroad, and the leadershi taken by U.S. ﬁrms in
the improvement of wor ing and living condi-
tions are so well known that I would not take the
further time of this Council by elaborating on this
oint.
P I was very interested to listen to mﬁy collea e
from Venezuela when by using the gures t at
were cited by the Soviet representative mainly
that the wages in this country, in the United
States, were supposed to be ﬁve times what the
ﬁrms were paying in Venezuela for the same type
of work, and he stated the ﬁgures that would bring
the workers wage to $75 in one industry and $83
a day in another industry. I submit, Mr. Presi-
dent, that if that were true many or most of this
Council might ﬁnd their way to Venezuela looking
for that kind of work.
Mr. President, the recitation of stale and dis-
credited propaganda slo ans does not contribute
a thing to the underdeve oped countries. It does
not produce any goods or services. What does
help produce the thin the underdeveloped coun-
tries need is the kin of enlightened private in-
vestment I have cited. The United States is not
interested in words. We are interested in deeds,
in injecting the lifeblood of free economic develop-
ment into those areas. The accom lishments of
the past few years provide bright 0 es for the
future toward a mutual effort in building a better
and freer world.
