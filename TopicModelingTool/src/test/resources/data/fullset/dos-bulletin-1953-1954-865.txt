peoples. At least the Asian peoples of India,
China, and Ja an are pardonably proud of the
fact that their orefathers were civilized when the
ancestors of the more aggressive peo les now liv-
ing in northern Euro e and the nited States
were wearing animal s ins.
The librarian of a New Hampshire public li-
brary, responding to a questionnaire regarding
the use of globes, replied “If people in general do
not begin to think in terms of the world as a whole,
they are probably doomed.” I heartily agree.
It is well to recall the words of Professor Mac-
kinder in his famous 1904 address: “. . . we shall
again have to deal with a closed political system,
and nontheless that it will be one of worldwide
scope. Every explosion of social forces, instead
of being dissipated in a surrounding circuit of un-
known space and barbaric chaos, will be sharpl
reechoed from the far side of the globe, and wea
elements in the olitical and economic organism
of the world will
be shattered in consequence.” °



Figure 9. Moscow-centered hemisphere
The hemisphere centered at Moscow, U.S.S.R., is the
white-ocean hemisphere on the left. The small white cross
on both maps is Moscow. It includes most of North
America, all of Africa and Asia, and much of Indonesia—
and thus most of the world's population.
The roundness of the earth is very real in human
relations. A globe is not merely an ornament nor
a backdro for photographs. The stamp of the
earth’s sp ericity is evident in all of the world
patterns that have yet been perceived in the geo-
physical, biogeographic, and social sciences, all of
them hugging closely to the roundness of the earth.
Consider the orogenic (mountain-building) pat-
terns and earthquake zones, the currents of air
(both surface and upper air), and all the other
phenomena of world weather, the ocean currents,
man’s routes of travel by air and sea, and his tele-
communication patterns. In the writer’s opinion,
the time has come to study logistics seriously on
the spherical surface of the globe: cost-distances
and time-distances by sea routes and land routes
versus air routes, and communications of all sorts.
Eventually even the patterns of man’s political

Figure 10. An important North Atlantic hemisphere
The straight line A00 through the center point (about
28° N., 81" W.) divides this North Atlantic hemisphere
into quarter-spheres. The western quarter-sphere thus
contains all of North and South America, including Greew
land, and a small portion of Siberia. The eastern quar-
ter-sphere comprises all of Europe and Africa (including
most of Madagascar) and more than 40 percent of the
area of Asia. The limit of the hemisphere, ABC'DA on
both maps, in a complete great circle (like the equator or
any meridian circle). The line A00 which divides it
into halves is half of such a great circle, the other half
of which is APG, the dotted line in the shaded half of the
Miller map at the right.
institutions will probably develop, or be discovered
already to bear, the unmistakable imprint of the
global relations of all mankind.
The globality of relations of the United States
is today measurably enhanced by the presence on
our shores of the United Nations. As we recall the
fears of man of our forefathers concernin the
adoption of tlie Constitution of the United tates
of America in 1787—88, we realize how they paral-
lel some of the fears voiced in our own time. They
could not imagine, 166 years ago, how peo les so
diverse as those of our original Thirteen tates,
separated from one another by weeks of the most
arduous travel, could ever become an integrated
nation. Patrick Henr , frightened by the lan-
guage of the reamble, emanded “what ri ht they
had to say, e the people 0 the Unite States,
instead of We the States, in rder to form a more
erfect Union . . .” In replying to Madison
atrick Henry said “I see the awful immensity of
the dangers with which it is pregnant. I see it.
I feel it. . . . Its adoption may involve the
misery of the other hemispheres” (note the plural
“hem1spheres”2. “The district, . . . ‘this ten
miles square,’ ’ said George Mason of Virginia,
“may set at deﬁance the laws of the surrounding
states . . . and may . . . become the sanctuary of
the blackest crimes.” Benjamin Franklin could
say only “I consent, Sir, to this Constitution be-
cause I expect no better, and because I am not sure
that it is not the best.” Writing in the hindsight
wisdom of our generation, Carl Van Doren ob-
served “Those who believed were more right than
those who doubted.“
