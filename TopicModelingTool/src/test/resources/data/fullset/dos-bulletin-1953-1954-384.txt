tion” and “reason” of his proposals should not be
readily perceived by the three Western Foreign
Ministers. This general ap roach was rather ab y
carried over into the Eng ish translation by his
interpreter Mr. Troyanovsky, the son of a former
Soviet Ambassador to this country, who speaks
colloquial American English.
Mr. Molotov showed great resourcefulness in
his endeavor to mask his rejection of the eminently
fair Western proposal for German “uniﬁcation in
freedom,” ' as somethin other than what this re-
jection really amounte to—an edict that Ger-
many must either remain divided, occu led, and
with a Communist puppet regime ru ing East
German , or else accept a defenseless ture and
rigged e ections which would inevitab y bring all
Germany eventually under Communist domina-
tion. But mere ingenuity could not and did not
suﬁice to cover up the naked fact of Mr. Molotov’s
refusal to accept the only workable plan for Ger-
man reuniﬁcation under an independent, freely
chosen representative government. Mr. Molo-
tov’s alternative was clearly a scheme to insure the
redominance of the Communist agents of the
Soviet Union over all of Germany.
A Transparent Ruse
Although dressed in the su erﬁcially attractive
trappings of withdrawal of a foreign troops and
elections supervised by the Germans themselves,
the ruse was so transparent that it could not be
maintained as a serious proposal likely of accept—
ance by the German people themselves—even the
beleaguered people 0 the Eastern Zone. Bitter
as is the pros ect of the continued artition of
Germany, the erman people of both astern and
Western Zones clearly would choose to suffer its
continuance rather than acce t this Soviet plan
which did not offer the semb ance, much less the
substance, of reuniﬁcation under a freely chosen
representative government, and which would
surely have led to their eventual enslavement.
To me one of the truly stirring moments of the
Conference occurred on the evening of February
10 at the Std‘dtische Opera House during a per-
formance of Die Walkiire. This was after Soviet
rejection of German reuniﬁcation had already been
made explicit. Mr. Dulles entered his box at the
o era late, immediately after leaving the 15th
enary session, where the three Western Foreign
Ministers had emphatically rejected the absurd
Soviet proposal for a defenseless Europe deprived
of the rotection of NATO and E00 and at the
mercy o the Soviet Union, with the U.S. relegated
to the nominal role of an observer, along with
the Chinese Communists.‘ Between the acts of
the opera, there was wave after wave of sponta-
neous applause for Secretary Dulles from the large

German audience. It was insistent, and it was
heart warming because it was so obviously a nu-
ine and unplanned tribute. Mr. Dulles soug t to
bring the salvos of ap lause to an end by retirin
to the rear of his box, at repeatedly he was call
forward again. No one who saw and heard that
tribute could doubt that the Germans understood
and supported the stand taken b Mr. Dulles in
company with his two Western co leagues.
Another memorable occurrence took place when
the Austrian delegation took its de arture in deep
disappointment on February 18. it was a tryin
moment for the Austrians, who had entertain
real hopes that the Soviets would ﬁnally agree to
sign an Austrian State Treaty which would have
I to the withdrawal of occupation forces and the
full restoration of Austrian soverei ty as pled ed
during the war, now 8 years over us. In a ra-
matic move on February 14, the Austrians and the
three Western Foreign Ministers had made the
extreme concession of agreeing to the harsh Soviet
version of the remaining ﬁve dis uted articles in
the draft Austrian treaty which ad been a sub-
ject of negotiation since 1947. The Soviet refusal
to accept the terms which they themselves had
once pressed for afforded a clear revelation of the
true nature of the Soviet position with respect to
restoration of Austrian independence. It gave
renewed evidence of the profound Soviet fear that
any relaxation of its iron grip on the peo les of
Central Europe might by a chain reaction sad to
an irresistible surge toward freedom on the part
of all the captive peoples.
When the Austrian delegation arose to leave
half way through the ﬁnal meeting on February
18, after it became manifest that the Soviet Union
would not agree to an Austrian State Treaty until
Soviet demands as to Germany had been met, the
poignancy of the scene pervaded every part of the
eat conference hall. The Austrians ke t their
isillusionment below the surface, but the ashing
of their hopes ave an emotional charge to the
atmosphere as r. Figl and his compatriots made
the rounds of the four Foreign Ministers to say
their farewells. There was no doubt as to who
was the villain of the piece, although Mr. Molotov
maintained all the amenities as he bade Dr. Figl
an outwardly cordial farewell. Nor was there
any uestion as to who upheld the Austrian na-
tiona aspiration as the touching farewells were
exchanged b the Austrians with the three West-
ern Foreign inisters.
And now for the Far East. We have been com-
mitted since the conclusion of the Korean Armi-
stice agreement last July, and the passage of the
UN. General Assembly Resolution on Korea last
August,“ to seek a Korean Political Conference.
We have been diligently seeking since early Sep-
tember to make the necessary arrangements for
such a conference on terms consonant with para-
