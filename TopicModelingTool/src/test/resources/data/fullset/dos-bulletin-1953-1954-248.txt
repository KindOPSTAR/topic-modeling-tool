the Secretary-General by telegram, as early as possible
and, in any event, prior to 22 January. If, for any reason,
your reply is not received by that date, I shall venture to
presume your concurrence with the initiative I have taken
in this matter.
6. I feel sure that Member State, having regard to the
grave responsibilities resting on the Commission and par-
ticularly on its Chairman, and on the Custodial Force of
India, as well as the importance of the unresolved aspects
of the Korean question and the continuing deadlock, will
readily concur in the initiative that I have taken in
pursuance of the General Assembly’s resolution.

Increase in Coffee Prices
Followi are the tewts of a letter from Mrs.
John B. Su li'van, Member of Congress from Mis-
souri, and a letter in reply from Thruston B.
Morton, Assistant Secretary for Congressional
Relations, regarding the recent increase in the re-
tail price of coﬂee:
LETTER FROM MRS. SULLIVAN
JANUARY 18, 1954
Honorable JOHN Fosraa DULLES
Secretary of State
Washington 25, D. 6'.
DEAR Mn. SECRETARY: The s irallin cost of
n coffee on arrival in the Ignited tates has
ed to a tremendous spurt in the price of coffee
at retail—so much so that restaurants are now
being forced to charge as much as 15 cents a cup
and the housewife is paying from $1.06 to $1.10
or more a pound by the tin. The worst aspect of
this unhappy situation is that the trade ﬂatly
predicts further, and perhaps even more substan-
tial, increases in coming days.
While it may be true that much of the increase
can be attributed to the frosts in Brazil last Jul
which reduced the 1953—54 harvest by perhaps i
percent, I also understand from trade reports that
speculation and hoarding in the supplier coun-
tries and probably in the United States too, are
also hig factors in the great surge of coffee prices.
Since we are completely dependent upon im-
ports for our supply of coffee, and since we are
dealing with countries with whom we have en-
joyed excellent relations and close ties of friend-
shi and commerce, is there not some way the
in uence of the Government of the United States,
through your Department, can be brought to bear
in this s1tuation to assure a better break for the
housewife and the consumer of this essential
product?
Has your Department made any effort to reach
agreement with the coﬂ'ee-su plying nations to
assure an adequate su ly of the reduced produc-
tion for our needs? ave you initiated any con-
versations toward assuring this supply at fair
prices?
In other words, Mr. Secretary, what is our
Government doing—and, also, what can it do
under present authority—to arrange with the
coffee- roducing nations for fairer marketing of
coffee in the United States? I know every Amer-
ican housewife would be interested in your
answers to both of those questions. I am cer-
tainly one housewife who would be.
As I told the House of Representatives today in
announcing that I was writing to you on this sub-
ject, I know this would not be the wei htiest mat-
ter on your mind at this moment. evertheless,
I do believe that if you want us as a people to
concern ourselves actively with the monumental
issues which confront you in representing us
among the nations of the world, please—please—
make sure we can all get a decent cup of breakfast
coffee.
‘Vithout that solace, how can we possibly face
up to the problems you want us to concern our-
selves with?
Sincerely yours,
LEONOR SULLIVAN
Mrs. John B. Sullivan, M. C.

LETTER FROM MR. MORTON
Press release 39 dated January 27
JANUARY 26, 1954
DEAR Mas. SULLIVAN: The receipt is acknowl-
edged of your letter of January 18, 1954 regard-
ing the recent increase in the retail price of coffee.
The latest information received from the United
States Embassy in Rio de Janeiro corroborates
your_1nformation that a major factor in the rice
rise_1s the limited supply of coffee which will be
available from Brazil as a result of a short crop
last year and frost damage to this year’s crop.
The Embassy has reduced its estimate of the sup-
ply available for ex ort from the 1953 crop from
15.6 to 14.1 million ags, a reduction of almost 10
percent. This estimate a plies to the crop ro-
duced in Brazil prior to the frost damage which
occurred last July and August. The crop now on
the trees cannot be estimated with any accurac
until later in the season, but the Embassy antici-
pates a smaller output than last year, even with
favorable growing conditions.
The reduction in the Brazilian crop estimate has
had an unusually pronounced effect upon prices
because it comes on top of an already tight supply
position. The world has been consuming more
coffee than it has produced for a number of years.
The excess of demand has been met by drawing on
reserve stocks, which are now very low. World
consumption of coffee is estimated to have exceeded
33 million bags last year. Supplies available for
export during the current crop year, which began
