TREATY INFORMATION



Military Assistance Agreement
With Nicaragua
The Departments of State and Defense an-
nounced on April 24 the signing, in Managua, of
a bilateral Military Assistance Agreement between
the United States and Nicaragua.1 Discussions

regarding the agreement were begun with Nicara-
guan ofﬁcials in Janua of this year and were
followed b recent IZamal negotiations in
Managua w ich resulted in the Signing of the
agreement on April 23, 1954.
This agreement is consistent with, and conforms
to, inter-American instruments already in effect,
such as the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal
Assistance (the Rio Treaty), the resolution on
Inter-American Military Cooperation approved
at the Washington Meeting of Foreign Ministers
of 1951, and the continuous planning of the Inter-
American Defense Board.
The agreement is the ninth of its kind to be
signed between the United States and one of the
other American Republics. Similar agreements,
involving the provision of military grant aid by
the United States to promote the defense of the
Western Hemisphere, have been signed with
Ecuador, Peru, Cuba, Brazil, Chile, Colombia,
Uruguay, and the Dominican Republic.2
These agreements were initiated under the pro-
gram of military grant aid for Latin America,
authorized in the Mutual Security Act of 1951.
They illustrate the spirit of cooperation prevail-
ing among the American Republics which makes
it possible for them to concentrate, through self-
help and mutual aid, upon increasing their ability
to contribute to the collective defense of the
Western Hemisphere.
U.S. and Japan Sign
Tax Conventions
Press release 199 dated April 16
On April 16, 1954, Acting Secretary smith and
the Japanese Ambassador, Sadao I Chi, Signed
two conventions between the Unite States and
Japan for the avoidance of double taxation and
the prevention of ﬁscal evasion, one relatmg to
taxes on income and the other relating to taxes
on estates, inheritances, and gifts.
The provisions of those conventions follow, in
general, the attern of tax conventions entered
1nt0 by the nited States with a number of other
countries. The conventions are designed, in the
one case, to remove an undesirable impediment
to international trade and economic develo ment
by doing away as far as possible with doub e tax-
ation on the same income, and in the other case,
to eliminate double taxation in connection with
the settlement in one country of estates in which
nationals of the other country have interests or
in connection with the making of gifts.
