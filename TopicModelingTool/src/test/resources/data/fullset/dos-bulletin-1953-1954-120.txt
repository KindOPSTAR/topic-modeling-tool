British Token Import Plan
To Be Extended
The British Token Import Plan will be ex-
tended through 1954, but new procedures and reg-
ulations will be established for o eration of the
Plan, the Bureau of Foreign ommerce. U.S.
Department of Commerce, announced on Decem-
ber 30. The new precedures are now being
worked out with the British Board of Trade, Brc
said.
The British Token Import Plan, established
with the United States in 1946, enables eligible
U.S. manufacturers or their agents to export to
the United Kingdom token shipments of speciﬁed
commodities whose importation from dollar
sources is generally prohibited by the British
Government.
Details of the new procedures for 1954 opera-
tions are expected to be reported within a few
weeks, Bro said. At that time Bro will also
notify past participants in the Plan. Every effort
will then be made to expedite distribution of the
revised application forms and processing of
applications.
Export-Import Bank
Credit to Ecuador
The Export-Import Bank of \Vashington on
J unuary 8 announced a credit of $2 500,000 to the
Republic of Ecuador to assist in ﬁnancing the
cost of improving and expandin the airport facil-
ities of the cities of Quito an Guayaquil. The
total cost of improvements desired by Ecuador
for the two airports is estimated at more than
$1,800.000. The cost of the air orts in excess of
the credit to be extended by the bank is to be pro-
vided by Ecuador.
With the technical assistance and advice of the
U.S. Civil Aeronautics Administration, Ecuador
has prepared preliminary plans and speciﬁca-
tions, conforming to CAA standards, for those
parts of the projects which will be undertaken
under the credit. The utilization of the banks
credit will be conﬁned to such phases of the roj-
ects as runways, taxiways, aircraft par ing
aprons, vehicle arking areas, and a new light-
ing system for t 1e Guayaquil airport Ecuador
has agreed to provide funds necessary for the con-
struction of terminal buildings and for other
improvements which may be undertaken in the
future.
Terms of ﬁnancing include the provision that
engineering and construction are to be performed
b U.S. engineering and contracting ﬁrms accept-
able to the bank. The loan will bear interest at
the rate of 4% percent per annum and will be
repaid over a period of approximately 15 years
beginning January 1, 1957.
The need for the improvement and moderniza-
tion of the Quito and Guayaquil airports has lon
been recognized. Because of the mountainous an
irregular topography of Ecuador, air travel is the
most ra )jd and economical type of transportation
available to unite various isolated sections of that
country and to provide for the needs of both in-
ternal and international commerce. At the pres-
ent time, the runways at both Quito and Guaya-
uil are l'elow C.\.\ standards. The facilities at
&uito are now inadequate for the larger type
‘4-motor planes bcing used in international air
transportation. The proposed improvements
will result in o enin this, the capital city, to in-
ternational ﬁig its 0% all types. The Guayaquil
runway will not only be extended but will be re—
orientcd and rebuilt to provide adequate drainage
to overcome a swampy condition now existing at
the airport. Runwavs at both airports will be
provided with asphaltic concrete or similar type
exible pavement.
Entry Into Force of Estate-Tax
Convention With Australia
Press release 5 dated January 7
According to information received by the De-
partment of State from the American Embassy at
Canberra, the estate-tax convention with Australia,
signed at “'ashington on May 14, 1953, was
brought into force on January 7, 1954, by the ex-
change at Canberra on that date of instruments of
ratiﬁcation.
The convention for the avoidance of double taxa-
tion and the prevention of ﬁscal evasion with re-
spect to taxes on the estates of deceased ersons is
one of three tax conventions with Austra ia signed
on May 14, 1953.‘ The other two relate to income
and gifts. All three were approved by the I‘nited
States Senate on July 9, 1953, and ratiﬁed by the
President on behalf of the United States on July
23. The income-tax and gift-tax conventions were
brought into force by the exchange of instruments
of ratiﬁcation on December 14, 1953. A press re-
lease in re ard to those two conventions was issued
on Decem r 22, 1953.
The rovisions of the estate-tax convention with
Austra ia follow, in general, the pattern of such
conventions with a number of other countries.
They are designed to eliminate double taxation in
connection with the settlement in one country of
estates in which nationals of the other country
have interests. The conventions a ply, so far as
the United States is concerned, on y to taxes im-
posed by the national government and do not apply
to the imposition of taxes by the several States,
the District of Columbia. or the territories or pos-
sessions of the United States.
