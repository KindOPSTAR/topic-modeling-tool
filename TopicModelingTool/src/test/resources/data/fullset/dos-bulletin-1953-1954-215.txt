sometimes been wrong, and he might have been
wrong when he accused us yesterday of being the
enemies of peace.
I recall that Mr. Molotov was wron in October
1939 when he condemned France an Britain as
being aggressors and praised Hitlerite Germany
as being the peace-seeking country. I have in my
hands a. speech which the Soviet Minister of
Foreign Aﬂ'airs made in Moscow on October 31,
1939.2 Already the war was on and, in Molotov’s
words: “It needed only one swift blow to Poland
ﬁrst by the German Army and then by the Red
Army, and nothing remained of this ugly oil'-
spring of the Versailles Treaty.” In that speech,
Mr. Molotov boasted of the “rapprochement and
the establishment of friendly relations between
the USSR. and Germany.” He then said that
“as far as the European great powers are con-
cerned, German is in the position of a state which
is striving for the earliest termination of the war
and for peace, whereas Great Britain and France,
which but yesterday were declaiming against ag-
gression, are in favor of continuing the war and
are opposed to the conclusion of eace.” “It is,”
said Mr. Molotov, “not only sense ess but criminal
to wage such a war—a war for the ‘destruction
of Hitlerism’ camouﬂaged as a ﬁght for
‘democracy’.”
Perhaps Mr. Molotov would admit that he then
made a mistake—we all make mistakes. That fact
should lead us not to be so conﬁdent of our judg-
ment that we hurl across the table accusations of
criminal intent.
It is quite natural that we should disagree with
each other and reason with each other in an effort
to get agreement. But I suggest that we should
not here recklessly attack each other’s motives.
I should like to reason with Mr. Molotov about
his plan for solving the German problem with
major dependence upon the so-called German
Democratic Government of East Germany.“

' Foreign Minister Molotov on Feb. 1 introduced an
amended version of a plan originally oﬁered by the
U.S.S.R. on Mar. 10, 1952 (for text, see BULLETIN of Apr. 7,
1952, p. 532). Following are the amendments he proposed:
To section entitled “Political Provisions,” add:
“No obligations of a political or military character aris-
ing out of the treaties or agreements concluded by the
Governments of the Federal Republic or the German Demo~
cratic Republic prior to the signing of the peace treaty
and the reuniﬁcation of Germany shall be meosed on
Germany."
To section entitled “Economic Provisions," add:
“Germany shall be fully exempt from payment to the
United States of America, the United Kingdom, France,
and the USSR of post-war state debts with the excep-
tion of those arising out of trade obligations."
To section entitled “Military Provisions," add:
“These armed forces shall be limited to those required to
meet the needs of internal security, local border defense,
and antl~aircratt defense."

He says: “The German problem is rst and ore-
most a roblem to be solved by the German people
themse ves,” and that Germany should participate
“at all stages of the peace treaty’s preparations.”
Need for Single
German Government
Precisely for that reason we believe that the
ﬁrst task is to establish a single German govern-
ment which can s eak authenticall for the Ger-
man people as a w ole. It will not 1elp us to have
a tumult of conﬂictin o inions.
It is the thesis of t e goviet Union, if I under-
stand rightly, that in the making of the peace
treaty we are to consult with the German people
through what the Soviet Foreign Minister calls
“the representatives of Eastern and Western
Germany.”
We know that in West Germany there is a ov-
ernment which draws its authority from the er-
man (people as a result of free and vigorously con-
teste elections. The people of the \Vest German
Republic had an opportunity to hear all the issues
debated from o pos1ng viewpoints and to vote for
candidates of t eir own choosing. The Govern-
ment of the West German Re ublic is, without
question, entitled to speak for t at large majority
of the German people who reside in the West Ger-
man Republic, and we do not doubt that it reﬂects
the overwhelming judgment of the East Germans
as well.
But how about the so-called “government” of
the German Democratic Republic which rules in
East Germany? According to the Soviet Foreign
Minister, it was “called to power by the over-
whelming majority of the population of Eastern
Germany.”
It is true that 98 percent of the eligible voters
a peared at the polling places. They came because
t ey had been told that, if they did not come, they
would be treated as “enemies of the peace” and
subjected to rave penalties as such. The entire
population of many villa es was forcibly rounded
up and marched to the pjls.
It is true that 99.7 rcent of the voters were
recorded as havin “e ected” the government of
the German People 5 Republic. The sto behind
this is that, after the voters arrived at t e polls,
the were handed a ballot. It was a ballot which
ha been secretly printed. And it was not made
ublic until election day. I have a copy of that
allot here. It is simply a list of names. No
place is provided on the ballot to indicate approval
or disapproval. There was no way to vote “110.”
There was not even a way to mark the ballot with
a “yes”—a privilege which, as I recall, even Hitler
conceded to his subjects. The voters were merely
ordered to put the ballot in the ballot box.
It might be noted in passing that the name which
heads the list on the ballot which I hold here in my
