shall be used for the purchase of sur lus agricul-
tural commodities to be sold to frien ly countries
for foreign currencies.
The proceeds from such sales can be used for
providing military assistance to our allies, for
purchasing goods or services abroad to provide
economic aSSistance, for loans to increase the pro-
duction of strategic materials, and for similar con-
structive purposes. By the end of 1953, nearly
$60 million had already been allotted for sales of
agricultural surplus commodities. (Total allot-
ments through January 31, 1954, increased to
nearly $90 million. By the end of January, also,
about $80 million of additional sales were under
active negotiation with a strong probability of
concluding such sales within 60 days. Another
$100 million worth were under consideration, of
which it was estimated that $50—$60 million worth
might materialize.) Special precautions are bein
taken to safe ard against displacing usua
marketings of either the United States or friendly
countries.
Food Parcels to East Germany—In a little
over 2 months, nearly 1 million East Germans
crossed to the western side of the Iron Curtain to
pick up and take home about 51A, million parcels
containing 18,000 tons of American food products.
The United States, acting in cooperation with the
West German Republic, instituted this food pro-
gram in July 1953 to show by concrete action the
concern of the West for the hungry people of East
Germany.
Despite various pressure tactics by their Soviet-
dominated government, the East Germans
swarmed into the lVestern Zone to get the food
they needed. The good will evoked by this
humanitarian program, and the better under-
standing fostered between East Germans and the
West, more than repaid the program cost.
Special Food-Package Program.—The various
food programs of the United States serve as a
means whereby the peo le of free world countries
share directly in the enelits of our operations
abroad. In addition to the “550” agricultural sur-
plus and East German food rograms, special
food packages were distribute on a world-wide
basis during Christmas-time 1953. These pack-
ages, holding 12 to 14 pounds of foodstuﬂ's in
a undant supply in this country were delivered
to needy families in lVestern Europe, the Near
East, and Latin America. With the cooperation
of the foreign governments involved, the pack-
ages, marked with the clasped-hand emblem sym-
bolic of United States programs abroad, were
distributed through local charitable groups and
other relief agencies.
Emergency Wheat Shipmenta.-—-The Pakistan
wheat program was inaugurated in late July 1953
to counter the threat of famine which faced the
friendly Pakistan people after two successive
years of drought. By the end of December 1953,
about 600,000 tons of wheat, programed under
special legislation, had been delivered or was en
route. The Ambassador of Pakistan stated in
November that recei t of the wheat from the
United States was he ping to save millions of his
people from starvation.
During the second part of 1953, food relief pro-
grams were also carried out for Bolivia, Jordan
and Libya. Under these programs 57,200 tons of
surplus wheat are being furnished to alleviate
serious food shortages in these countries. Bolivia
will receive 45,000 tons of wheat under the $5
million emergency authorization for the country
previously mentioned. Jordan received 10,000
tons of wheat; and Libya, 2,200 tons. The total
value of the grain shipments to these three coun-
tries, programed under Public Law 216, is esti-
mated at $6.5 million.
CWILINING FOR GREAT“ EFFICIENCY
The Presidential reorganization plan creating
the Foreign Operations Administration (Fon)
became effective on August 1, 1953.’ By October
1, the necessary reorganization measures were
completed. The Mutual Securit Agency, the
Ofﬁce of the Director for Mutua Security, the
Technical Cooperation Administration, the Insti-
tute of Inter-American Affairs, and several other
formerly segmented foreign operations were
merged into a sin is uniﬁed structure.
In carrying orward its various activities
abroad, the Foa receives forei policy guidance
from the Secreta of State andn idance on mili-
tary policy from t e Secretary 0 Defense. Broad
proposals for any major undertaking overseas are
passed u n b the National Security Council.
On this ounci regularly sit as statute members
the President, the Vice-President, the ecretaries
of State and Defense, and the Directors of the
Foreign Operations Administration and the Office
of Defense Mobilization. Approval by the Na-
tional Security Council thus insures that the
actions carried out under the mutual security pro-
am are coordinated with the nation’s security
interests.
The Public Advisory Board and the Interna-
tional Development Advisory Board, both com-
posed of outstanding rivate representatives of
the American people, a so provide valuable advice
on basic matters of foreign operations.
This integrated pattern of operation permits a
more concentrated and effective approach to the
problems of free world security and development.
A speciﬁc situation of assistance to a given coun-
try, for example, may involve not only technical
cooperation but also the uestion of raw mate-
rials prices, the relationships to our own stock-
piling, the issue of East-West trade controls, the
extent of the country’s available markets, its eco-
nomic and defense ties with neighboring countries,
