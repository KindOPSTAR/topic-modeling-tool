tiations for provisional commercial agreements
with Chile and Ecuador were also underway.
There were, too, efforts to terminate the ﬁnancial
control exercised by the United States in Ha1ti
under a 1933 agreement. The adverse effect upon
American interests of exchange restrictions in sev-
eral countries was of concern to the State Depart-
ment as were proposed provisional commercial
agreements invo ving Brazil, Germany, and Italy.
The record on relations with Mexico covers such
issues as expropriation of lands owned by Amer-
ican citizens, and the religious situation in Mexico.

1931, Volume II, British Commonwealth, Europe,
Near East, Africa
Press release 290 dated May 28
The De artment of State on June 5 released
Foreign elations of the United States, 1937,
Volume II, The British Commonwealth, Europe,
Near East and Africa. This is the ﬁrst of the
series of ﬁve volumes of diplomatic correspondence
to be published for the year 1937. The other four
volumes will be released during the next few
months.
Prominent among the sub'ects treated in this
volume are the eﬁorts of the epartment of State
to promote more liberal trade policies by discus-
sions looking to the conclusion of reciprocal trade
agreements and representations against discrimi-
nating practices damagin to American commerce.
Secretary of State Cor ell Hull conceived his
trade agreements program not merely as a means
for promoting American business but as one im-
portant instrument that would help maintain in-
ternational peace. In a memorandum which he
handed to the British Ambassador on January 17,
1937, it was stated that cooperation by the United
States with Great Britain for world peace and
national security “must necessarily be premised
upon the positive understanding that the Govern-
ment of Great Britain is in fact disposed to take
part in a practical manner in advancing the cause
of world peace by cooperating in turn with the
United States in its endeavor to bring about the
elimination of those restrictions which today are
stiﬂing legitimate international trade.” (p. 2)
Mr. Hull was much concerned with respect to
British-Canadian trade negotiations which he
looked upon as a move backward toward national-
istic economic policies. Discussions for trade
agreements with the United Kingdom and Canada
continued throughout the year. (pp. 1—94; 160—
168). Final agreements were not signed until No-
vember 17 , 1938. Other countries with which ac-
tive trade discussions are recorded for 1937 are
Australia, New Zealand, Belgium, Czechoslovakia,
Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Lith-
uania, Norway, Poland, Switzerland, Iraq, Li-
beria, and Turkey.
Two projects for international cooperation with
Canada documented in this volume were those for
the St. Lawrence Waterway (pp. 168—176) and the
Alaskan Highway (pp. 191—198).
A number of issues tended to strain relations
with the Nazi Government of Germany in 1937.
Persecution of Jews continued with additional re-
strictive measures being applied. (pp. 319—327)
Trade relations were unsatisfactory. (pp. 327—
348) The German Government made representa-
tions against derogatory remarks b Mayor La
Guardia of New York about Hitler. pp. 367—377)
While regret was ex ressed that remarks should
have been made whic gave offense, Mr. Hull told
the German Ambassador, Hans Luther, that if his
Government wanted to be a tremendous factor in
electing American ofﬁcials it could easily do so by
coming to the United States Government with
such com laints. ( . 374) Ambassador William
E. Dodd ikewise toid the German Foreign Ofﬁce:
“If the German ress wish to see La Guardia re-
elected Mayor ofP New York on a huge ma'ority,
they have only to continue taking notice 0 what
he says and is free to say.” (p. 375) Later in the
year, the German Ambassador complained of
utterances of Ambassador Dodd and was informed
that Mr. Dodd would soon relinquish his 0st.
He was replaced as Ambassador by Hugh Wi on.
(pp. 377—385)
mong many matters of diplomatic concern in
the Near East recorded in th1s volume were the
Montreux Conference for the abolition of capitu-
lations in Egy t, the withdrawal of American
diplomatic andp consular representatives from
Ethiopia, which was under Italian occupation, the
grant of an oil concession by the Iranian Govern~
ment to the Amiranian Oil Company, pro osed
abolition of capitulatory rights of the nited -
States in the French Zone of Morocco, and interest
of the United States in British r0 osals for the
partition of Palestine between ra s and Jews.
Documentation on the Spanish Civil War for
1937 is printed with other multilateral questions

United States, The Soviet Union, 1933—1939.
