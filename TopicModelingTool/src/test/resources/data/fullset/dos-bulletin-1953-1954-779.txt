The Soviet Power System—the Challenge to Our Security
by Livingston T. Merchant

\Vhat I want to talk to you about tonight are
some of the reasons why—after victory in lVorld
War II—we have foiind itiinperative to organize
for peace and security.
In essence, there is only one reason. It is for
the only reason that throughout history nations
have been forced to group themselves together and
or anize themselves politically and militarily to
deIend their security and maintain the peace. It
is because nations themselves confronted with
a threat'to' 'théirrsecurity. That threat today is
plairand we know exactly the direction from
which it comes. It comes from a small group of
power-hungry men who have established them-
selves in’ the’Kremlin as the force directing the
eXpansionist drive of Soviet Communist imperial-
ism. It is the Soviet power system, as it has been
organized and directed by those men, that is the
challenge and the threat to their security. That
is the menace against which we have found it
necessarv to or anizerourselves with other free
nations uring decade?"
Even in 1930, w en Earlham College held its
ﬁrst Institute of Foreign Affairs, the criminal
designs of Soviet communism a ainst interna-
tional order were not new. The ommunist con-
spiracy which sought by revolutionary methods
to overthrow the existing social order was active
in many of the European countries long before
World War I. It was, indeed, “Torld lVar I
which gave them their ﬁrst great o portunity.
Des ite the disruption of that war, t ey accom-
plis ed their revolutionary purposes in only one
country—Russia. In all the other countries,
political, economic, and social stability was able
to reassert itself and the Communists failed. In
Russia they succeeded. But for a considerable
period thereafter the men who had succeeded by
orce and fraud in seizing political power in
Russia were too reoccupied with their own bloody
internal strugg es for position and authority to

threaten the world outside. The world watched
this struggle for power within the Kremlin durin
the twenties and thirties, with its sensationa
purges, its show trials, and mass liquidations, but
the spectacle tended to mask the deep drive and
purpose behind it.
The threat of the power system that the Soviet
leaders were then consolidating through this
bloody process did not become apparent until the
world was startled into awareness by the signing
of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of Au st 1939.
This compact between criminals gave azi Ger-
many the green li ht to war and it rewarded Soviet
acquiescence in itler’s plans for conquest with a
broad extension of Russ1a’s western frontier. In
the secret protocol to that Pact, which was never
ublished until 1948,2 Nazi Germany and Soviet
ussia divided control of Eastern Europe between
themselves.
The obvious purpose of this arrangement, for
the Soviet olitico-military strategists, was to
purchase a orward strategic position for them-
selves at the expense of their neighbors, Poland,
the Baltic States, and Rumania. We may legiti-
mately ask ourselves whether another Soviet
motive may not have been to push the Nazis into
an exhausting war with the democratic countries
of \Vestern Europe so that when both sides were
sufﬁciently weakened, Soviet communism would
have a clear ﬁeld for its ex ansionist aims. At
any rate, we do know that t e Soviets faithfully
collaborated with the Nazis in seizing the booty
offered by the terms of the Molotov-Ribbentrop
pact. The two partners divided up Poland be-
tween them. That was in 1939.
Next, in 1940, in stark violation of the non-
aggression treaties which the Soviet Union had
forced on the three Baltic States of Lithuania,
Latvia, and Estonia Stalin sent in his troops to
take military control as a preliminary to the now
familiar pattern of fake plebiscites and forced
incorporation into the Soviet system.
