roportionate decline in imports. It is a cause
or satisfaction that this has not so far proved to
be true of the present readjustment.
Other Elements of Economic Situation
As for the other elements which are seen by
the survey as being “special” or “temporary,” a
few additional comments are in order. It is prob-
ably true that the European demand for imports
was abnormally low in 1953 and that this was a
signiﬁcant factor in the im rovement of its trade
balance. The im lication ere, however, that a
rise in European imports might necessarily have
adverse effects on this trade balance requires some
qualiﬁcation. As the survey points out, the level
of imports itself, through its effects on the incomes
of the countries from which the imports come. has
a major influence on the level of ex orts. This
is likely to prove an important offsetting factor to
any strain on the balance of payments as Europe’s
imports grow in the future.
In this connection, the rogressive elimination
of trade barriers, to whic we have already re-
ferred, is especially signiﬁcant. Despite tempo-
rary difficulties, encouraging progress has been
made in the past year toward the establishment of
a common market in Europe and the removal of
restrictions on trade and payments. As more lib-
eralized market, trade, and payments measures
now under consideration by the \Vestern European
countries are adopted, for both the intra-Euro-
pean sector and between Europe and world mar-
_ ets, these should tend to reduce production costs
in Europe, stimulate competition in the European
market, and generally encourage a more effective
use of resources.
Another temporary factor in the favorable eco-
nomic situation in Western Europe during 1953
cited by the surve was the high level of U.S. ex-
penditures abroa . The survey correctly points
out that the level of extraordinary disbursements
abroad by the United States is likely to shrink in
the future. But such shrinkage will not take back
the additions to European reserves which have
alread taken place, and which will continue for
some time. And, in the meantime, there is a sub-
stantial margin of safety which can ease the prob-
lems of adjustment.
One other important development tends to miti-
gate the effect of the prospective decline in U.S.
aid. This factor is the high level of U.S. imports
from Enrol? The survey points out that a
doubling of nited States urchases from Europe
since 1950 has virtually 0 set the decline of eco-
nomic aid to Europe. It is shown that total U.S.
purchases of goods and services from Western Eu-
rope have been running at an annual rate of over
5 illion dollars, and that European exports to
the United States in 1953 rose to record heights—
in contrast to a shrinkage in sales to most other
overseas markets. The survey then makes the
important observation that these developments
have had the result that Euro e has had a rela-
tively stable total supply of do lars, and that the
major ﬂuctuations in its dollar position have thus
been the results of changes in its dollars payments.
This development is in part also the result of
the general process of reducin trade barriers
which has been going on in the .S. for the past
20 years. The effective level of our tariff toda
is about one-quarter of what it was in 1934. e
are importing goods at the rate of over 111/2 bil-
lion dollars a year, 1% times by volume and 21/2
times by value what we imported before World
\Var II. Of that amount 6% billions entered free
of any duty whatsoever. And it should be en-
couraging to other countries that the greatest
increases in the imports of the U.S. last year were
in the area of dutiable imports, not duty-free im-
ports. When you add over a billion dollars for
shipping and other transportation services, plus
other purchases made abroad, you come out with
the fact that, quite aside from an direct aid or
investment, the U.S. put at the isposal of the
rest of the world last year the huge sum of 161/2
billions of dollars.
You are also all aware of the mone and knowl-
edge which our Government and usineSSmen,
whom some have referred to as “protectionist,”
have put freely at the disposal of the countries of
\Vestern Europe to help them become more pro-
ductive and more competitive in all world markets,
including our own.
Randall Commission
The U.S. Government has demonstrated its
appreciation of the importance of a steadily ex-
anding world economy and the need for U.S.
initiative and leadership in moving toward this
objective. Toward this end, the President estab-
lished a Commission on Foreign Economic Policy,
popularly known as the Randall Commission, to
review and recommend a propriate foreign eco-
nomic policies for the U.S. In his statement to
the organization meeting of this Commission,” the
President said:
No group of citizens has been called to a higher mission
than the one you are setting forth today. The economic
health of our own country and that of other friendly
nations depends in good measure on the success of your
work. Your task is to ﬁnd acceptable ways and means
of widening and deepening the channels of economic
intercourse between ourselves and our partners of the
free world.
As you know, the report of the Commission
now completed is advisory in nature. We con-
sider the report forms a basis for a constructive
reformulation of U.S. policy in this ﬁeld. The ad-
ministration is now reviewing the ﬁndings of the
Commission and is about to submit proposals to
' BULLmriN of Oct. 5, 1953, p. 450.
