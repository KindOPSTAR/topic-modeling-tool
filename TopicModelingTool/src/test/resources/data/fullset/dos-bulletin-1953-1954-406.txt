In many of the American Republics, govern-
ment plays a much more important role in eco-
nomic aﬂ'airs than we think desirable for ourselves.
Some of you may think in terms of governmental
capabilities, where we think in terms of private
activity. Action which some of your governments
would undertake as a normal function mi ht seem
to us a major departure from our stan ards of
peacetime activity. Equally, op ortunities and
safeguards for private activity w ich we treat as
a matter of course may seem to some of you to be
extraordinary.
No one of our Republics should expect another
to abandon its economic creed, in which its peo le
believe and which seems adapted to its articu ar
environment. Nevertheless, we must nd more
and better ways to cooperate. Happily, there are
vast areas within which there are no basic ob-
stacles, as evidenced by the very large amount of
business which we do with each other. There is,
and will continue to be, a vast exchange of goods
between our countries to our mutual advantage.
There will, I hope, be a substantial flow of ca ital
which will help develop the vast potentia re-
sources of many of our southern neighbors.
But what now is, is not good enou h to be ac-
cepted as satisfactory. We must do tter. We
must eradicate some of the difﬁculties and ob-
stacles for which none of us can properly be held
exclusively responsible.
We have heard here at this Conference a number
of _economic complaints directed against the
United States. I take no offense at that. This is
the place where we should talk frankly as friends,
and it is best that we should sa what is on our
minds. However, I ask you to lieve that these
matters are not as simple as they sometimes sound.
The difﬁculties may seem relatively small, but
they can establish precedents which would have
vast scope and consequences.
The situation requires that we should not be
self-righteous, either in defense or attack, but that
we should go forward with good will, tolerance,
and patience to ﬁnd an understanding. When I
mention patience, I am not referring to delay but
to effort which in order to be successful must be
careful and painstaking.
The United States is eager to see within this
hemisphere people who everywhere share the
health of a good economy in the form a propriate
to their own society and their own i eals; who
have the opportunity to engage usefully in con-
genial work of their own choosing; and to enjoy,
with their families and their neighbors, in peace
and tranquillity, the fruits of their labor.
The United States will not continue to be satis-
ﬁed merely with good political relations in this
hemisphere. \Ve also want good economic rela-
tions. \Ve shall seek them on a basis of mutual
respect for the economic and social, as well as the
political, beliefs of each other. That is the pledge
I give you.
STATEMENT BY ASSISTANT SECRETARY WAUGH
Press release 127 dated March 10
The members of the United States delegation
who arrived 10 days ago have reported with en-
thusiasm the cordial rece tion they have received
in this beautiful capita of our host country.
Since arriving a few days ago, I have caught this
same spirit.
We all look forward during the Conference to
renewing old friendships as well as making new
friends. It is our most sincere hope that, working
jointly with you, we will be able to make some
worthwhile contributions toward solving some of
our mutual problems.
In his openin address last week,‘ Secretary
Dulles mention the report of the Randall Com-
mission with which you are all familiar. In the
very near future—possibly while we are still
here—our President will send to the Congress a
message outlining his recommendations for a
foreign economic policy in the light of that report.
The Secretary also discussed the ﬂow of capital
and technical assistance, our position on the coffee
situation, and the action our President has just
taken on the wool tariff. I might add that on
Monday our Government announced a reduction
in countervailing duties on wool tops from 18 to 6
percent.2 I am also pleased to refer to the heart-
enin news of the progres made in several recom-
men ations in the Eisenhower report.
The Secreta clariﬁed certain uestions about
the future len ing olicy of the xport-Import
Bank and mentione the importance we lace on
the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development.
The statements which have been made in this
Commission have been presented in a spirit of
frankness and ood will. This spirit we wish to
reciprocate. reat care has gone into the pre -
aration of your statements, and the deserve t e
serious consideration of all. In t e committee
meetings to follow, our delegates will sit dowu
with you and discuss these and other important
economic subjects in more detail.
The economic development of the entire hem-
isphere is of major interest to the United States.
We are all partners in seeking common economic
goals. These common purposes were perhaps
most simply and clearly expressed in the economic
charter of the Americas: “To live decently and
work and exchange productively in peace and
security.” The economic growth of each of us
strengthens and broadens the basis for stable dem-
ocratic societies of free men. One of the best
assurances of a workable inter-American system is
the continued success of our efforts toward greater
economic development.
The basic philosophy of the United States em-
phasizes individual freedom. Our economic be-
