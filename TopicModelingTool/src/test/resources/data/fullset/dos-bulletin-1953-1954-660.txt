So far as the United States is concerned, the
conventions apply only with respect to United
States (that is, Federal) taxes. They do not apply
to the imposition of taxes by the several States,
the District of Columbia, or the Territories or
Possessions of the United States.
Under the terms of the conventions, they will
be brought into force by the exchange of instru-
ments of ratiﬁcation. Meanwhile, each country
will take such action as is necessary in accordance
with its own constitutional procedures with a view
to ratiﬁcation. The conventions will be submitted
to the United States Senate for advice and consent
to ratiﬁcation.
On the occasion of the signing of the conven-
tions, notes were exchanged conﬁrming an under-
standing regarding the application of certain
provisions of the income-tax convention.
