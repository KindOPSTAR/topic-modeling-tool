In pursuance of this custom, which we hope to
continue to the benefit of ourselves and others, we
have had an exchange of views on Indochina and
Southeast Asia.
Mr. Dulles expressed admiration for the gallant
ﬁ ht of the French Union forces, who continue
w1th unshakeable courage and determination to
repel Communist ag ession.
\Ve deplore the act that on the eve of the
Geneva Conference this aggression has reached a
new climax in Viet-Nam particularly at Dien-
Bien-Phu and has been renewed in Laos and ex-
tended to Cambodia.
The independence of the three Associated
States within the French Union, which new agree-
ments are to com lete, is at stake in these battles.
lVe recognize t at the prolon ation of the war
in Indochina, which endangers t 0 security of the
countries immediately affected, also threatens the
entire area of Southeast Asia and of the Western
Paciﬁc. In close association with other interested
nations, we will examine the possibilit of estab-
lishing, within the framework of the nited N a-
tions Charter, a collective defense to assure the
peace, security and freedom of this area.
We recognize that our basic objective at the
Geneva Conference will be to seek the re-establish-
ment of a peace in Indochina which will safe-
guard the freedom of its people and the independ-
ence of the Associated States. We are convmced
that the possibility of obtaining this objective de-
pends upon our solidarity.
Statement by Secretary Dulles 1
I went to London and Paris because of the criti-
cal situation in Indochina and the threat that it
carried to the vital interests of many countries in
Southeast Asia and the Paciﬁc.
Amon those vital interests are those of the
French nion and the British Commonwealth. I
returned well satisﬁed with the results of my trip.
The loss of the China mainland to communism
was a reat disaster. That disaster would be com-
poun ed if there were added to it the loss of the
millions of people, the vast economic resources,
and the strategic position represented by South-
east Asia and the Paciﬁc islands.
I feel conﬁdent that that loss can be prevented
without extending the Indochina war if the free
nations having vital interests in the area are united
in a determination to preserve peace and freedom
in the area. That unity of purpose rests upon
full understanding. That understanding has been
greatly enhanced by the talks which I have had in
London with Prime Minister Churchill and For-
eign Secretary Eden, and the talks I have had in
Paris with Premier Laniel and Foreign Minister

Bidault. Our common urposes were e
in 'oint statements whic we issued on
in ondon and yesterday in Paris.
Alread before I left for London the Govern-
ment of hailand had indicated its approval of
our purposes, and President Magsaysay of the
Phillippines has now indicated acceptance in prin-
ci e.
Ibut of this unity, which is now takin deﬁnite
form, will come free-world strength which, I be-
lieve, will lead the Communists to renounce their
extravagant ambitions to dominate yet another
major portion of the globe.
The Geneva conference, which begins a week
from Monday, will be a test. I am more than
ever persuaded that if the free world stands ﬁi'inf
the Geneva conference will advance the cause 0
freedom in Southeast Asia and the Paciﬁc, and
safeguard that freedom in peace and justice.
U.S. Policy Toward Indochina
Statement by Jameson Parker
Department Press Oﬁcer ‘
Certain remarks with regard to United States
policy toward Indochina have been attributed to
a high Government official [Vice President Nixon].
The contents of the speech referred to and ques-
tions and answers which followed were off the
record, but a complete report of the speech has
been made available to the State Department.
The speech enunciated no new United States
policy with regard to Indochina. It expressed
full agreement with and support for the policy
with respect to Indochina previously enunciated
by the President and the Secretary of State.
That policy was authoritatively set forth by
the Secretary of State in his speech of March 29,
1954,2 in which he said:
Under the conditions of today. the imposition on South-
east Asia of the political system of Communist Russia and
its Chinese Communist ally, by whatever means, would
be a grave threat to the whole free community. The
United States feels that that possibility should not be
passively accepted but should be met by united action.
This might involve serious risks. But these risks are
far less than those that will face us a few years from
now if we dare not be resolute today.
In regard to a hypothetical question as to
whether United States forces should be sent to
Indochina in the event of French withdrawal, the
high Government official categorically rejected the
