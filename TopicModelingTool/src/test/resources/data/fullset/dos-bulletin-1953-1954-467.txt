and its capacity to absorb a certain scale and type
of aid. All these complex matters, so closely inter-
woven, are now being considered in the light of
one consistent operational policy so that the great-
est ossible advance can be made toward the de-
sire goals.
For most rapid and efﬁcient action, the ﬁeld of
Fox operations was organized into four regional
divisions—Europe; Near East, South Asia and
Africa; Far East; and Latin America. These
regions correspond exactly in area coverage to the
ographic regions of the Assistant Secretaries of
tate. This regional breakdown thus insures a
direct coordination between program operations
and policy formation.
Another component deals with the difﬁcult and
far-reaching problem of controls on trade relating
to the SOVth Bloc, more familiarly known as
East-West trade. In addition, since various
problems that arise in different parts of the globe
ave many similarities in method of treatment,
a number of technical activities—for example,
food and a iculture, industrial and labor aﬁ'airs,
trade and investment—were grouped to operate
on a functional basis.
Alon with these fundamental organizational
princip es, the Director of the Foreign Operations
Administration, Mr. Stassen, also introduced a
fresh approach to the actual conduct of the various
programs and rojects. Procedures were worked
out to decentr ize to a much eater degree than
ever before the authorit an responsibility for
taking the initiative an makin decisions. In
line with this emphasis on ecentralization,
increased reliance has been placed on the judgment
and effectiveness of the regional directors in the
Washington organization and the Mission direc-
tors in the ﬁeld. The overseas Missions, in turn,
have decentralized their own operations by
working more in the grass roots areas and less
in the capital cities.
The consolidation of agencies and functions
into the organizational framework of the Fox
made it possible to effect a heavy reduction in
administrative overhead. Total direct employ-
ment in Washin on was reduced by 24 percent
or some 450 positions, between January 31 and
December 31, 1953. In the same period, the
European Regional Office in Paris was cut by
56 lpercent in personnel strength; also, the three
am assadorial positions in Paris were reduced to
one. Direct emplo ment in the European Mis-
sions was reduced iiy about 30 percent. On the
other hand, the number of United States techni-
cians in the ﬁeld in the underdeveloped areas
has been increased by 35 percent to accord with the
invigorated technical cooperation eﬁ'ort. In sum-
mary, Washington overhead has been reduced,
and overseas effectiveness has been increased.
These personnel shifts have been carried out in
conformance with the expressed wish of Congress
to reduce administrative costs by 20 percent.
The Fox has been woven into a cohesive, tightly
knit organization, working with maximum econ-
omy and full efﬁciency to accomplish the objec-
tives of United States policy.
Mutual Securlty and the Future
As strength in the free world, particularly in
Europe, has grown, total funds appropriated for
United States r0 ams overseas ave been grad-
ually decrease . he reductions in milita and
economic aid, in general, have parallele the
growing self-reliance of the nations we are help-
ing. In several countries, the need for United
States aid is over; in others, this aid has been con-
siderably reduced in magnitude; in still others, aid
will most probably reach an end in the near future
as economic strength is built up. On the other
hand, a number of new or expanded programs
have been initiated—such as the increased eﬁ'ort
against Communist aggression in Indochina, the
rebuilding of war-shattered Korea, and the new
agreements with Spain. We are also working
out methods of using our domestic food surpluses
overseas.
To produce truly worthwhile and durable
results, United States programs abroad must be
planned and carried out in the context of long-
range calculations. The development of the
NATO alliance, the global buildup of military
bases and military forces, the technical coopera-
tion and special economic aid programs in the
less developed areas—these programs are being
contracted or expanded in accord with plans to
attain ositions of solid free world economic
and mi itary strength to combat a long-term
danger and enhance the opportunities for world
stability. Such programs cannot be drastically
cut without undoing much of the rewarding
success that has been so painstakingly and labori-
ously achieved.
The amounts and types of aid we give must
depend, of course, on changing world conditions.
As long as the United States maintains its prom-
inent position in world affairs, and as long as
the harsh threat to world peace exists, our
country will continue to shoulder the heavy obli-
gations of world leadership. The United States
cannot properly live up to the unavoidable re-
sponsibilities of power and at the same time
serve the best interests of the American people
without responding in a positive way to the needs
of other free peoples who require some measure
of outside support in trying to lay the stepping
stones to their own advancement. The long-
term goals of the mutual security program are
inseparably interwoven with the long-term se-
curity of the United States and with world efforts
for freedom, progress, and peace. It is on this
basis that mutual security program operations
are moving forward throughout the free world.
