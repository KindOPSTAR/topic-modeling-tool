sal destructiveness, the virtual obliteration of
space as a protective shield, has brought all of us
to the frontline of any new war.
Amid such alarms and uncertainties, doubters
begin to lose faith in themselves, in their country,
in their convictions. They begin to fear other
people’s ideas—every new idea. The begin to
talk about censoring the sources and t e commu-
nication of ideas. They forget that truth is the
bulwark of freedom, as sup ression of truth is the
weapon of dictatorship. e know that when cen-
sors ip goes beyond the observance of common
decency, or the protection of the nation’s obvious
interests, it quickly becomes, for us, a deadly
danger. It means conformity by compulsion in
educational institutions; it means a controlled
instead of a free press; it means the loss of human
- freedom.
The honest men and women amon these would-
be censors and regulators ma mere y forget that
the rice of their success would be the destruction
of t at way of life they want to preserve. But the
dishonest and the disloyal know exactly what they
are attempting to dO—perverting and undermin-
ing a free society while falsely swearing alle-
giance to it.
Whenever, and for whatever alle ed reason,
people attempt to crush ideas, to mask their con—
victions, to view every neighbor as a possible
enemy, to seek some kind of divining red by which
to test for conformity, a free society is in danger.
Wherever man’s ri ht to knowledge and the use
thereof is restricte , man’s freedom in the same
measure disappears.
Our l-Ierltage of Dlssent
Here in America we are descended in blood and
in spirit from revolutionaries and rebels—men
and women who dared to dissent from accepted
doctrine. As their heirs, may we never confuse
honest dissent with disloyal subversion.
Without exhaustive debate—even heated de-
bate—of ideas and rograms, free government
would weaken and Wither. But if we allow our-
selves to be persuaded that every individual—0r
party—that takes issue with our own convictions
is necessarily wicked or treasonous, then indeed
we are approaching the end of freedom’s road.
We must unitedly and intelligently support the
principles of Americanism.
Effective support of rinciples, like success in
battle, requires calm and) clear judgment, courage,
faith, fortitude. Our dedication to truth and
freedom, at home and abroad, does not require—
and cannot tolerate—fear, threat, hysteria, and
intimidation.
As we preach freedom to others, so we should
practice it among ourselves. Then, strong in our
own integrity, we will be continuing the revolu-
tionary march of the founding fathers.
As they roused in mankind the determination
to win political freedom from dynastic tyranny,
we can ignite in mankind the will to win intel-
lectual freedom from the false propaganda and
enforced ignorance of Communist tyranny.
Throu h knowledge and understanding, we will
drive from the tem 1e of freedom all who seek
to establish over us tiiought control—whether they
be agents of a foreign state or demagogues thirsty
for personal power and public notice.
Truth can make men free! And where men are
free to plan their lives, to overn themselves, to
know the truth, and to un erstand their fellow
men, we believe that there also is the will to live
at eace.
ere, then, in spite of A-bombs, H-bombs, all
the cruel destructiveness of modern war; in spite
of terror, subversion, pro aganda, and bribery,
we see the key to peace. That key is knowledge
and understanding—and their constant use by
men everywhere.
Today, of course, we must have infantry—and
lanes and ships and artillery. Only so can we
e sure of a tomorrow and the op ortunity to con-
tinue the mobilization of spiritua and intellectual
energies. But there is no time to waste if truth
is to win the war for the minds of men! Here
is the unending mission of the university—indeed,
of every educational institution of the free
world—to ﬁnd and spread the truth!
We send rofessors, scholars, and students out
to the schoo s of the free world, to promote under-
standing of us even as they grow in knowledge
and in understanding of others. This practice
must be accelerated.
We ﬁnd room in our own schools for tens of
thousands of oun men and women from other
lands who wit in t e American community learn
the truth about us and give understandin of their
own people. This effort must be expan ed.
The pur oses of the free world must not be too
limited! ur goal is not merely to react against
inroads of Communist lies and attacks. That
would be endless and proﬁtless; the tactics of
falsehood are limitless. We must ‘oin with our
friends in a crusade of truth. e must make
our aim the building of peace in justice and free-
dom. That is a worthy objective and a golden
reward. Under God, the united energies of free
people can attain it.
“The rospect now before us in America,” wrote
John A ams in 1765, “ought to engage the atten-
tion of every man of learning to matters of ower
and of right, that we may be neither led nor riven
blindfolded to irretrievable destruction.” And he
ended by saying, “Let every sluice of knowledge
be opened and set aﬂowing.”
Tonight I think it ﬁtting to repeat John Adams’
exhortation, conﬁdent that, prompted by reason
and armored by faith, we shall speed the advance
of knowledge and liberty on their hand-in-hand
journey along the avenue of the ages.
