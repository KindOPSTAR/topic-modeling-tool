has been considerin with us here contains certain
articles which the viet Union has not objected
to. Article 1 says that “the allied and associated
powers recognize that Austria is reestablished as
a sovereign, independent and democratic state.”
The essence of sovereignty is to be able to exclude
from your country the armed forces of other na-
tions, if you do not want them, and also the es-
sence of sovereignty is to be able to make depend-
able alliances with other nations, if on so wish.
We believe that Austria should have th of these
ri hts, and it is precisely both of these rights
which would be denied by the amendments tpro-
posed by the Soviet Union. They would, in e ect,
nullify the provisions of article 1 which I have
read, and would equally nulli the provisions of
article 2, which says that the “a lied and associated
powers” will respect the independence and the
territorial inte rity of Austria.
As I have said here, the United States does not
itself maintain any armed forces upon the terri-
tory of any other soverei state except at its
expressed raritieest and deSire, and only as it so
desires. We lieve that that sound system should
be a plied to Austria.
e are not disposed to go alon with a treaty
which imposes upon Austria a fun amental, basic
impairment of the soverei rights which ostensi-
bly, in the ﬁrst artich oﬂhe treaty, we give to
Austria, and then, in later articles, we entirely
take away.
Thus, the treaty would in effect become a fraud,
offering sovereignty and territorial integrity by
the ﬁrst and second articles, and taking them away
by article 4 his and article 33.
I beg that the Soviet Foreign Minister will per-
mit this treaty to be prompt y signed, as be pro-
fesses he would like to have it signed, by allowing
the treaty to be a enuine treaty for the sover-
eignty and indepen ence of Austria.
STATEMENT OF FEBRUARY 17
Press release 78 dated February 18
I will comment on the observations made by the
Soviet Foreign Minister.
He supports his roposal for troop withdrawal
in East and “’est Germany on the basis that this
would give satisfaction to the German eople.
I am sure he can speak with authority as far
as the Eastern Zone is concerned; I doubt whether
he can speak with the same authority as far as
the “'estern Zone is concerned.
I can say that there has been no intimation of
any kind received from the authorities of \Vest
Germany, or from the people of West Germany
that they would like to see the withdrawal of
troops of the W'estern Powers which are in
Germany.
On the contrary, there is evidence that there
would be very considerable concern if these troops
were withdrawn, given the situation which exists
in the East.
Therefore, I am afraid that, while the proposal
might give satisfaction in the Eastern Zone, it
would not give satisfaction in the Western Zone.
If the Soviet Union is ca er to give people satis-
faction b ' troop withdrawa s, I would suggest that
a good p ace to begin would be in Austria, where
there is no question but what all the eople
eagerly desire all the troops to be withdrawn.
There we are assured of a chance to give satisfac-
tion. The SOViet delegation might give further
consideration to that matter and perhaps indicate
their acceptance of the Austrian State Treaty
when we take that up tomorrow afternoon.
There is, however, a rea50n more fundamental
than any I have indicated so far why the United
States does not feel itself able to accept the Soviet
proposal which is entitled, “()n ensuring Euro-
pean Security.” That is the paper which calls
or the ﬁnal withdrawal of forces.
Analogous Case In Korea
What the Soviet Union asks the Western Pow-
ers to do, presumably in the name of European
security, is what we did under very analo ous
circumstances in Korea immediatel reee ing
1950. Our withdrawal in that case di not pro-
duce security; it produced war.
Korea, like Germany, was divided. Korea, like
Germany, was divided under conditions so that
roughly two-thirds of Korea was occupied by
Vl'estern forces and the other third occupied by
the nomWestern forces.
The analogy is closer because the indi nous
forces in North Korea, like the forces in Eﬁiestern
Germany, were highly organized and trained,
whereas those in Southern Korea and in Western
Germany were only police forces.
Moreover, Molotov has questioned Mr. Eden’s
statements with reference to the East German
military personnel. The United States has very
reliable information to reveal that the East Ger-
man military ersonnel now total 140200 men
under arms. f this number 100,000 are in the
ground forces with an additional 25,000 serving in
security formations. There are 7 organized divi-
sions of which 3 are mechanized. Air forces con-
stitute 60 'et ﬁghters manned and trained b 5,000
ollicers. ese forces are commanded y ex-
oflicers of the Nazi Wehrmacht and of the SS.
They are additional to 100,000 East German
police.
I can assure the Soviet Foreign Minister that
there is nothing comparable in West Germany.
There are ample means of access to information
so that any one can ascertain that fact readin for
himself.
There is in West Germany a total of 150,000
police, none of whom have any more than normal
police armament. That number is to be thought
