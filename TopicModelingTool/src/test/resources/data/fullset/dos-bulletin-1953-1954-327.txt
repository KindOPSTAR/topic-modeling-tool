and as Mr. Molotov was com elled to respond
to our probing of his words, t e Soviet purpose
became apparent.
The seating and speaking order at the Confer-
ence table were such that it always fell to me to
speak ﬁrst after Mr. Molotov. Then after me
came M. Bidault of France and then Mr. Eden of
Britain. They carried with conspicuous ability
their share of the task. Between the three of us,
we exposed what lay behind Mr. Molotov’s clever
words. For the ﬁrst time in 5 years the people
of West Euro e, America, and indeed all who
could and wou d observe, sized up today’s Soviet
policy out of Mr. Molotov’s own mouth instead of
y guess or by theory.
It amounted to this:
To hold on to East Germany;
To permit its uniﬁcation with West Germany
only under conditions such that the Communists
would control the election machinery through
all Germany;
To maintain Soviet troops indeﬁnitely in
Austria;
To offer Western Europe, as the rice of Soviet
“good will”, a Soviet-controlled urope which
would exclude the United States except in the
nominal role of an “observer” along with Com-
munist China.
This last Soviet project for what Mr. Molotov
called “European securit ” was so preposterous
that when he read it laug ter rippled around the
Western sides of the table to the dismay of the
Communist delegation. -
Laughter is a denial of fear and the destroyer
of mystery—two weapons upon which the Soviet
Union has relied far too long. Both of these
weapons were swept aside in one moment of West-
ern laughter.
But Mr. Molotov did more than just to furnish
us with an occasion for ridicule. In that same
breath he told Germany that the price of uniﬁ-
cation was total Sovietlzation. He told Austria
she was to be occupied until German paid the
Soviet price. He told France that t e western
frontier of communism was to be the Rhine and
not the Elbe. He told all Western Europe, includ-
ing the United Kingdom, that the price of momen-
tary respite was for the Americans to go home.
His ﬁnal utterances were harsh. When he called
for the abandonment of a European Defense Com-
munity, the dismantling of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, the scrapping of United
States bases, he spoke with no soft words. Gone
was the post-Stalin “new look.” Thus he made
clear What, to some, had been in doubt.
The Soviet position admitted of no real nego-
tiation. There is no middle ground between free
German elections and the kind of elections which
were carried out in the Eastern Zone of Germany,
where the people were forced to deposit Commu-
nist Party ballots bearing one set of names alone.
There is no middle ground between a free and
independent Austria and an Austria inﬁltrated
with Russian soldiers.
There is no middle ground between an Atlantic
community defense system and “Americans, go
home.”
There is no middle ground between freedom and
slavery.
For the clearest and shar est and simplest ex-
ition of these basic trut , all of us are in-
debted to Mr. Molotov.
In my closing statement before the Conference
last Thursday afternoon,‘ I recalled that we had
fou ht the Second World War for goals expressed
in the Atlantic Charter, to which the Soviet Union
had subscribed. One of these was “freedom from
fear.” But, once victory was won, the dominant
Soviet motive had been “fear of freedom.”
There is no doubt in my mind that the Soviet
leaders genuinel fear freedom. They do not feel
safe unless freedbm is extinguished, or is defense-
less. That Soviet attitude made it impossible to
achieve any agreement at Berlin in relation to
European matters.
Unity of the West
I have referred to the efforts of the Western
Ministers to require Mr. Molotov to expose Soviet
policies in their reality. That eﬁort gave drama
to every meeting of the four. There was another
aspect which carried, too, its drama. That was
the effort of Mr. Molotov to divide the three West—
ern Powers.
Mr. Molotov occasionally complained that he
was at a disadvanta e because we were three to
his one. But from 1is standpoint, that was an
advantage. It is much easier to divide three than
it is to divide one. If Mr. Molotov had achieved
that division, he would have won the Conference.
In that respect, he failed totall . The Conference
ended with a greater degree 0 unity between the
three Western Powers than had existed when the
Conference be an.
That unity id not come about merely because
there had been prior planning. There had been
able lanning, and our United States staff was one
of w ich all Americans can be proud. But no
planning could anticipate all the moves which
could be made by so shrewd a diplomat as Mr.
Molotov and which called for instantaneous re—
sponse. The unity that emerged was a natural and
s ontaneous unity which came from the fact that
t 1e three Foreign Ministers stood for governments
and nations which were dedicated to the concepts
of human liberty and national integrity which Mr.
Molotov attacked.
It is a tragedy for the peoples of Germany that
Germany and erlin must remain divided; and
for the people of Austria that they remain occu-
