groundwork for a future era of peace when atomic
energy ineVitably will be doing constructive work
in the world.
This policy is not only humanitarian. It also
serves our national interest. We shall at more
uranium from abroad when the uranium usiness
becomes more advantageous for supplying nations
in terms of advancin their nuclear power aspira-
tions. They want owledge even more than
money. This want can only be met b us by mak-
ing it possible for some American tec nical infor-
mation and some American material to go to such
countries when it is in our interest.
There is a degree of dependence on our part on
off-shore sources of uranium for our national ro-
gram. Naturally such uranium supplyin nations
00k to the day when electric ower wil be pro-
duced in such nations from t eir own uranium.
Three circumstances—( 1) the developing Soviet
program, (2) our dependence on forei uranium,
and 3) le itimate hopes for nuc ear power
abroa —com ine to create the need to amend the
international cooperation provisions of the Atomic
Energy Act of 1946.
Other countries are making progress in atomic
ower technology. There is a owin tendenc
or certain raw-materials supplying nations whic
are not industrially well advanced to turn to such
other countries for nuclear power information be-
cause thei have been disappointed by our inability
to give t em signiﬁcant help. It is clear to me
that if this trend continues, the interests of the
United States will be seriously affected. There is
no need here to emphasize how important it is for
us to stay ahead of the U. S. S. R. in providing
knowledge of how to put atomic energy to peace-
ful uses.
In extending abroad, under proper security
safeguards, the evolving technology of atomic
energy for peaceful purposes, we shall tighten the
bonds that tie our friends abroad to us, we shall
assure material resources that we need, and we
shall maintain world leadership in atomic
energy—leadership which today is such a large
element of our national prestige.
Pmldent's U.N. Proposal
I know that the hope has been expressed that
the proposed legislation will be sufﬁciently broad
to permit implementation of the President’s inter-'
national atomic energy proposals expressed last
December. I would certainly like to be able to tell
you that the time is ripe for putting such pro-
posals into operation. This unfortunately is not
the case, and until we have a clearer idea of how
the international discussions on the President’s
proposal will evolve, we are not in a position to
state that the bill contains all the authority which
will ultimately be required. However, the lan-
guage of the proposed bills does not offer any
obstacles to the President’s proposal and lays the
general groundwork needed to implement it. I
would point out, however, that the international
negotiations to implement this plan are still in an
inconclusive state.
lntornatlonal Cooperatlon—Mllltary Uses
I support also a change in our atomic energy
law to permit disclosure of certain military infor-
mation to our allies. The PreS1dent some 3 months
ago said:
Our own security will increase as our allies gain infor-
mation concerning the use of and the defense against
atomic weapons. Some of our allies, in fact, are now
producing ﬂssionable materials or weapons, supporting ef-
fective atomic energy research, and developing peacetime
uses for atomic power. But all of them should become
better informed in the problems of atomic warfare and,
therefore, better prepared to meet the contingency of such
warfare!
The gravity of the present international situa-
tion lends great emphasis to these words of the
President and lends added ur ency to this matter
of increasin our allies’ capagilities in these new
techniques 0 war. We particularly need author-
ity to transfer to nations articipating in defense
arrangements with the Uhited States a limited
type of tactical information essential to defense
planning and training of personnel for atomic
warfare.
In the conduct of our foreign relations much is
beyond our control. But here is an instance where
it is clear] within our control to increase United
States abi ity to gain greater security. The pres-
ent legal restraint on disclosure of even limited
types of weapons information has become a real
handica in our collective effort with our allies
to buil necessary strength to resist a gression.
I understand that the Department of efense is
concerned because the remedial language of the
bill authorizing this type of military interchange
falls somewhat short of what is needed. I hope
a way can be found to permit the amount of inter-
chan e of military information which is needed
to en ance our security.
In modernizing our atomic energy law I feel
that we will be taking three steps in the direction
of peace : First, we Will be increasing the deterrent
factor represented by our weapons stockpile by
the prowsions we have requested permitting us
to integrate certain tactical weapons information
into our foreign military planning; second, by
being able to give our friends abroad atomic
energy information and material, we shall be
strengthening our capacity to build the raw-mate-
rial base on which our entire atomic energy pro-
gram rests 5 and third, we will be strengthening
the ties which unite the free nations by a sense 0
fellowship.
