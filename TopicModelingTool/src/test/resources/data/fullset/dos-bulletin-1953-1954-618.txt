or anizations, the National Federation of Business
an Professional Women’s Clubs, has taken leader-
ship in the equal pay ﬁeld. One of its methods,
for example, is the use of an “ ual pay kit,” con-
taining materials for use by their clubs in support
of equal pay at State, national, and international
levels; a radio script on equal pay; a suggested
speech; a suggests program for a meeting; ar-
ticles in its monthly magazine; and various other
materials. This or anization also emphasizes the
need for vocationaFtraining opportunities to ﬁt
women for higher level jobs where they will qual-
ify for the same work and pay as men.
Another interestin example of recent public-
opinion activities in t e equal pay field was carried
on by a member of the Federal Congress prior to
her introduction of a Federal equal pay bill. In
an extensive study covering almost a year, she sent
uestionnaires to about a thousand leaders in
merican labor, business, education, and women’s
affairs. The experts who replied almost all
agreed with the principle of equal pay and a ma-
jority were in favor 0 Federal legislation to en-
force it. This public 0 inion poll was extremely
useful in stimulating public support for the bill.
I am sure that in many other countries similar
educational work is going forward. I would
therefore like to suggest that the Secretary-
General obtain from nongovernmental organiza-
tions an account of the steps being taken on an
unofficial basis in the various countries to promote
public education and acceptance of the principle
of equal pay. In addition to the ILO report deal-
in with oﬁicial action, such an account of un-
oﬂigcial activities would be helpful to this Commis-
sion. It would enable each of us to proﬁt from
her neighbor’s experience and would provide many
useful ideas for voluntary programs to help give
practical meaning and effect to equal pay.
\Ve also look forward to hearing statements by
nongovernmental organizations at the current
session. These will furnish concrete examples of
the type of information that the Commission could
hope to obtain from an account of this kind next
year.
EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN
U.S./U.N. press release dated April 5
Our discussion this year indicates that education
for women has become an important, if not the
most important, ﬁeld of action for our study and
planning. Education provides women with the
knowledge and the conﬁdence to use the rights
they have gained—their rights and responsibilities
as citizens, as wives and mothers, as workers, and
as individuals. The word education means much
more than schools, or literacy, or the study of
books. Voters who could not read and write have
repeatedly demonstrated understanding of issues
and maturit of judgment. All of us here today
are gratefu for the wisdom which has been
handed down through enerations from person to
person. Education em races the whole of culture,
and the manner in which we gain our knowledge
should never be confused with knowledge itself.
The problem we face in this Commission is that
in many countries there are women who have
never had an opportunity to learn much of their
world, and there are girls toda who are not hav-
ing the same opportunity as t eir brothers to go
to school. The causes for such denial of oppor-
tunity are many and various, but they are not un-
conquerable. The report we have before us, the
UNESCO report on access of women to education
(E/CN.6/250), is valuable for exactly this rea-
son—it provides us not only with careful statistics,
but also with some analysis of the problems which
account for the variations between continents and
countries. Another document which seems to us
of great value is the report of the Committee on
Non-Self-Governing Territories on the Education
of Girls (A/AC.35/L.133).
I would like to discuss the situation regardin
education on the basis of these documents, wit
particular attention to three problems:
First, assurance for girls of full educational op-
portunities.
Second, more teachers, and more women in
teachin .
Thir , scholarships and fellowships for women.
I believe you all have before you the resolution
on education introduced by six delegations, in-
cludin the United States.’ This resolution deals
with t ie three points I have just stated.
l-‘ull Educatlonal Opportunltles for Glrls
The UNESCO re ort is to be commended on many
grounds. One 0 these is the plan to survey edu-
cation for girls over a 3-year period, so that we
can consider in greater detail the progress achieved
in primary, secondary, and higher education.
This seems a wise division of material, and our
delegation expresses satisfaction with it. The sec-
ond chapter of the report, on UNESCO activities in
1953, is also of interest.
U.S. COMMISSION ON “I! EDUCATION 0' '0.“
The Unssco report mentions a Commission on
the Education of IVomen set up recently in the
United States. This is a voluntary effort, spon-
sored by one of our professional organizations,
the American Council on Education. The Com-
mission is being paid for by private sources and not
by Government funds. Among its members are a
' U.N. doc. E/CN.6/L.145. The resolution. as amended.
was adopted on Apr. 7 by a vote of 16—0, with the United
Kingdom abstaining.
