As I listened to the calm, wise words of M. Bi-
dault, I could not but think of our own President
Lincoln, who, animated by the s irit of “malice
toward none and charity towar all,” forged a
political unity which has produced the lar est
measure of human welfare that the world ias
yet known.
As Mr. Molotov pointed out, France, equal]
with Russia, was a Victim of nazism. But M. Bi-
dault evoked the spirit which can bind u and heal
the wounds of war. Mr. Molotov evoke the spirit
of vengeance and of hatred which marked the ill-
fated treaty of Versailles. He recalled the de-
cisions of Yalta. It was Yalta which called for
the “dismemberment of Germany,” for the strip-
ping of Germany of all removable assets, and for
im ressed German labor.
These decisions of Yalta, which my own Gov-
ernment shared, were understandable in the con-
text of the day. The German war was. still in
full vigor, and wars are not won by a spirit of tol-
erance. But it is sad that today, years Since the
German armistice, one of the parties to the Yalta
Conference should attempt to revive the bitter-
ness and the hatred of those days and the cruel
decisions which that hatred and bitterness
occasioned.
The Mood at Versailles
I had some part in the Paris conference which
created the Treaty of Versailles. It is easy for
me to recall the mood of that conference. We
then believed that the way to exorcise eVil from
the German spirit was to occupy Germany, to
demilitarize Germany, to impose upon Germany
humiliating discriminations so that she would al-
ways be a nation apart, branded openly With the
stigma of Cain.
From that ex eriment, those who truly and
wisely seek peace ave learned that no great nation
is made harmless by subjecting it to discrimina-
tions so that it cannot be an equal in the family of
nations. Restrictions such as were imposed _by the
Treaty of Versailles, and as are implicit in the
Soviet proposals of yesterday, merely incite a
people of Vigor and o courage to strive to break
the bonds im osed upon them and thereby demonstrate t eir sovereign equality. Pro_ib1-
tions thus incite the very acts that are prohibited.
In contrast to the Soviet reversion to a sterile
and dangerous ast is the French approach as put
forward by M. idault. France has resolved not
to repeat that past. In the interest of ermanent
peace, she is striving to forge strong 11 s of com-
mon interest and purpose to unite Germany With
her neighbors.
We can well pause here to pay tribute to the
genius of France which has drawn together the
six nations of Western Europe in the Coal and Steel
Community, which has conceived the European
Defense Community (E00), and which stimulates
the development of a European political com-
munit .
Sucli creative thinkin marks freedom at its
best. It condemns to ri icule those who would
destine France to a humble place in the Soviet
world of enforced conformity.
Mr. Molotov professes to fear that the European
Defense Communit would be dominated by Ger-
man militarism. lius is precisely what no is
designed to prevent. It is a program which ac-
ceptably precludes an German national army and
any German Genera Staﬁ'. I say “acceptably”
because the treaty operates in a nondiscriminatory
way. Each of the countries of the European De-
fense Community accepts for itself in Europe the
same conditions as apply to Germany. Thus,
there is brou ht into being a modest defense force
in which individual Germans have a minority part
and the whole of which is dedicated to defensive
purposes. No part of the European army can
ever be used to serve any national ends in Europe.
That is a program which the Germans themselves
willingly accept. The German eople are eager
as are the peo 1e of France, to nd a way to end
forever the hi eous spectacle of the European na-
tions ﬁghting each other. The treaty to create
the European Defense Community was conceived
by France, has been si ned b France, Germany,
Italy, Belgium, the Net ierlan s, and Luxembourg.
The process of ratiﬁcation is far advanced. There
is no known substitute for Eoc. Certainly the
Soviet Union has proposed none exce t a return
to the obsolete, bankrupt system 0 Versailles
and other so-called “peace” treaties which have
bred war.
Surel statesmansliip can do better than to re-
create t e world’s worst ﬁre hazard. The country
and eople of the Soviet Union have been cruelly
muti ated by the consequences of German hos-
tility toward France. It seems incredible that
Sowet leaders should now be devoting themselves
to reviving that Franco-German hostility and to
obstructing a uniﬁcation which would realize the
vision of the wise European statesmen who for
generations have been preaching unity as the in-
ispensable foundation for lasting peace.
The Soviet Foreign Minister suggested that the
formation of a European or North Atlantic treaty
military force mi ht lead to the creation of a de-
fensive alliance 0 other European countries, thus
splitting Europe into two opposing military
cups of states. This is a grotesque inversion of
istory.
Following the end of World lVar II, the United
States withdrew its vast armies and air and naval
forces from Europe and largely dismantled its
military establishment. The United Kingdom did
likewise. Western Europe itself was left totally
devoid of military strength. The WVestern nations
put their primary dependence in the pledges of
the United Nations Charter. They continued to
do so until June 1951. Then the sudden outbreak
