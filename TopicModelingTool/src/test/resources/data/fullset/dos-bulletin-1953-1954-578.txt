us undue concern. I shall, of course, take appro~
priate action to ensure that our security is fully
safeguarded.
Convortlblllty
The Commission rightly regards positive rog-
ress toward currency convertibility as an indis-
pensable condition for a freer and healthier inter-
national trade. Steps toward enabling holders of
foreign currencies to convert them freely into
other currencies deserve our encouragement.
The Commission has correctly observed that the
initiative and responsibility for introducing cur-
rency convertibility must rest with the countries
concerned. I am happy to say that such initiative
is being taken. The British and other members
of the Commonwealth of Nations have met twice,
in London and in Sydney to consider plans for
convertibility of the pound sterling. The United
Kingdom and other important nations of Euro e
have discussed their aims with us. Individual y
they are taking constructive steps affecting their
own currencies. In addition, discussions amon
them which are now under way in connection witg
the renewal of the European Payments Union are
being largely inﬂuenced by their desire to prepare
the way for convertibility.
I have approved the Commission’s recommenda-
tions for cooperation in strengthening the gold
and dollar reserves of countries which have pre-
pared themselves for convertibility by sound in-
ternal and external policies. These recommenda-
tions do not call for new action by the Congress.
Authorit and procedures for this purpose already
exist. T e United States will su port the use of
the resources of the International Idonetary Fund
as a bulwark to strengthen the currencies of coun-
tries which undertake convertibility. In addition,
a study is now being made as suggested by the
Commission, of the possibility of standby credits
from the Federal Reserve System.
Conclusion
“'hat I have outlined to on is a minimum pro-
gram which should be ju ged as a whole. Its
various parts are interrelated; each requires the
other.
Conceived as a whole, this program consists of
four major parts:
Aid—which we wish to curtail;
Investment—which we wish to encourage;
Convertibility—which we wish to facilitate;
and
Trade—which we wish to expand.
I consider it essential that we achieve each of
these objectives, which we must clearly understand
are closely interlocked: As we curtail our aid, we
must help to close the dollar gap by expanding
our foreign investment and trade. This expansion
will be facilitated by a return to convertibility of
foreign currencies. The return by our friends
abroad to convertibility will be encouraged if our
trade policy leads them to expect expansion of our
forei n trade and investment.
Un ess we are prepared to adopt the policies I
have recommended to ex and export and import
trade and increase the ow of our ca ital into
foreign investment, our friends abroa may be
discouraged in their effort to reestablish a free
market for their currencies. If we fail in our
trade policy, we may fail in all. Our domestic
em )loyment, our standard of living, our security,
an the solidarity of the free world—all are in-
volved.
For our own economic growth we must have
continuously eXpanding world markets; for our
security we require that our allies become eco-
nomically strong. Ex anding trade is the only
adequate solution fort ese two pressing problems
confronting our country.
