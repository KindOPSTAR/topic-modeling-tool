Hungarian Plane Case in International Court of Justice
DEPARTMENT ANNOUNCEMENT
Press release 111 dated March 5
As announced at the International Court of
Justice at The Hague on March 3, 1954, the U.S.
Government ﬁled with that Court ap lications in—
stitutin proceedings against the Soviet and Hun-
garian overnments on account of their conduct
in connection with the four American airmen who
came down on Hungarian soil in a U.S. C—47 mili-
tar aircraft November 19, 1951.
s annexes to the a plications there were trans-
mitted copies of the ormal diplomatic notes de-
livered to the Soviet and Hungarian Governments
by the U.S. Government on March 17 , 1953,1 and
the replies received from the Soviet and Hun-
garian Governments. The applications, the De-
partment of State is informe , have been duly
transmitted by the registrar of the International
Court of Justice to the respondent Governments
and are being transmitted to all governments en-
titled to appear before the Court as required by
the rules of the Court.
In ﬁlin its applications with the International
Court of ustice, the U.S. Government ave care-
ful consideration to the fact that the oviet and
Hungarian Governments had not submitted to the
compulsory jurisdiction of the International
Court of J ustlce and had not responded to the U.S.
Government’s invitation, contained in its notes of
March 17, 1953, either to enter into a special a ee-
ment with the U.S. Government submitting siese
cases to the Court or to ﬁle with that Court dec-
larations accepting the Court’s jurisdiction for
this dispute. nstead, in a note of June 19, 1953,
replying to this Government’s note of March 17,
1953, the Soviet Government, without being re-
sponsive to the charges made by the U.S. Govern-
ment, stated:
The Soviet Government considers the proposal of the
United States Government concerning the submission of
this question to the consideration of the International
Court to be without foundation since there exists no sub-
ject for such consideration and equally since there exists
no basi for bringing any claims whatsoever against the
Soviet Union.

‘ For a summary of these notes, see BULLme of Apr. 6,
1953, p. 496.
In a note of November 2, 1953, the Hun arian
Government, referring to this Government s note
of March 17, 1953, stated:
. . . the Hungarian Government considers the case
of the four American ﬂyers as closed.
The Hun arian Government made no effort to
res 0nd to t e detailed charges of the U.S. note.
i hile customaril , in the past, cases have been
brought before the f'nternational Court of Justice
under special written agreements between the
dis uting governments or on the basis of prior
dec arations by both overnments acceptin the
Court’s jurisdiction, are Court’s rules an the
Court’s jurisprudence permit a complaining gov-
ernment to ﬁle an ap lication unilaterally upon
the premise that the defendant overnment will
tacit y or by its own unilateral eclaration agree
to a hearin of the dispute b the International
Court of ustice. This method was left open
for cases where the defendant government might
have been unwilling to join in any preliminary
agreement with the complaining government or
to ﬁle a formal declaration acce ting jurisdiction
in advance of the dispute itser being brought
before the Court by the complaining government
but where it was nevertheless willing to appear
and defend a proceeding instituted against it. I
The U.S. Government has exhausted the chan~
ncls of diplomacy in seeking satisfaction in these
cases. The U.S. Government is conscious, how-
ever, that the human rights, and international
rules of conduct with respect to overﬂying air-
planes, involved in this case, are subjects which
have assumed importance in international rela-
tions. The case is one particularly suited to the
institution of the International Court of Justice
both as to an authoritative determination of the
facts and as to a formulation of the rules of law
which civilized governments should observe in
these ﬁelds.
In determining to bring this matter before the
International Court of Justice in this way, the
Department of State has been moved by the desira-
bility of promoting the establishment and main-
tenance of the rule of international law and order.
