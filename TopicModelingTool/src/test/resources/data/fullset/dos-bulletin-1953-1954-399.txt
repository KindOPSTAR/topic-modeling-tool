of the Political Integrity of the American States
Against International Communist Intervention ‘
Wuaams:
The American Republics at the Ninth Interna-
tional Conference of American States declared that
international communism, by its anti-democratic
nature and its interventionist tendency, is incom-
patible with the concept 0! American freedom, and
resolved to adopt within their respective territories
the measures necessary to eradicate and prevent
subversive activities;
The Fourth Meeting of Consultation of Ministers
of Foreign Aﬂairs recognized that, in addition to
adequate internal measures in each State, a high
degree of international cooperation is required to
eradicate the danger which the subversive activities
of international communism pose for the American
States;
The aggressive character of the international
communist movement continues to constitute, in the
context of world affairs, a special and immediate
threat to the national institutions and the peace
and security of the American States, and to the
right of each State to develop its cultural, political
and economic life freely and naturally without
intervention in its internal or external affairs by
other States;
THE TENTH INTER-AMERICAN CONFERENCE,
I
CONDEMNS the activities of the international com-
munist movement as constituting intervention in
American affairs;
Exraicsses the determination oi! the American
States to take the necessary measures to protect
their political independence against the intervention
01! international communism, acting in the interests
of an alien despotism; and
Rnrraas'ras the faith of the peoples of America in
the eﬂective exercise of representative democracy

as the best means to promote their social and polit-
ical progress; and
Dacnsans:
That the domination or control of the political
institutions of any American State by the interna-
tional communist movement, extending to this
Hemisphere the political system of an extra-conti-
nental power, would constitute a threat to the
sovereignty and political independence of the Amer-
ican States, endangering the peace of America, and
would call for a meeting of consultation to consider
the adoption of measures ‘ in accordance with exist-
ing treaties.
II
RECOMMENDS!
That without prejudice to such other measures as
they may consider desirable, special attention be
given by each of the American governments to the
following steps for the purpose of counteracting the
subversive activities of the international commu-
nist movement within their respective jurisdictions:
1. Measures to require disclosure of the identity,
activities and sources of funds of those who are
spreading propaganda of the international com-
munist movement or who travel in the interests of
that movement, and of those who act as its agents
or in its behalf; and
2. The exchange of information among govern-
ments to assist in fulﬁlling the purpose of the reso-
lutions adopted by the Inter-American Conferences
and Meetings of Foreign Ministers regarding inter-
national communism.
3. This declaration of foreign policy made by the
American Republics in relation to dangers originat-
ing outside this Hemisphere is designed to protect
‘and not to impair the inalienable right of each
American State freely to choose its own form of
government and economic system and to live its own
social and cultural life.'

Most of the leaders of the Soviet Communist
Party a pear before the eyes of the world as
responsi le ofﬁcials of the Soviet Government. In
this capacity they conduct relations with the other
Governments through the traditional institutions
of diplomacy. But at the same time they 0 erate
and control this worldwide clandestine p0 itical
or anization to which I have referred.
ntil the Second World War, Moscow’s control
over this organization was exercised openly
through the central headquarters of the Commu-
nist International, the so-called “Comintern.”
That was a political association to which all of the
Communist parties belonged and it had its seat in
Moscow. Durin the war the Comintern was of-
ﬁciall abolishe . Since that time the control
over t e foreign Communist parties has been exer-
cised b the Moscow leaders secretl and infor-
mally, at for the most part no less e ectively than
before.
As proof of this fact one does not need to search
for the precise channels through which this control
proceeds, although some of them in fact are known.
f one compares Soviet propaganda with the po-
litical positions taken by individual Communist
ofﬁcials and agents around the world, both from
the standpoint of substance and timin , it becomes
clear beyond possibilit of doubt, t at there is
this highly disciplined ierarchical organization
which commands the unquestioned obedience of its
individual members.
The disciplinary requirements include a ﬁrm
insistence that loyalty to the movement, which
means in effect loyalty to the leaders of the Com-
