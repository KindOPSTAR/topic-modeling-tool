hand is the name of Mr. Ulbricht, a one-time Soviet
citizen.
I wonder whether Mr. Molotov really believes
that this type of so~called “election” gives the so-
called “government” a mandate to speak for the
people of East German .
I myself doubt that that performance rovides
the means of ﬁnding out what the East ermans
really want. That doubt s rings not only from
the character of the so-cal ed ‘elections” them-
selves, which I have described, but also from what
has happened since.
East German Attitude
‘l’eward Rulers
Since the October events that I describe, nearly
a. million East Germans have ﬂed the East zone to
the West zone and West sector of Berlin. Does
that prove the popularity of the rulers and their
ca acity to s ak for the ruled?
ast year ungry Germans under the rule of
their so-called “ overnment” sought and obtained
ﬁve million foo parcels from the West. Does
that prove that the people are satisﬁed with their
rulers?
In the Eastern area there is an armed force of
250,000 to keep order. That is one guard for 80
persons. In \Vest Germany there is one police-
man for 330 persons. Does this shockin dis-
crepancy prove that the East Germans free y ac-
cept the order that their rulers impose?
If the facts I mention do not sufﬁce to prove to
Mr. Molotov my point, I can mention more. But
I hope it will not seem necessary to do so.
As I understand the roposals of the Soviet
Union, they treat it as o the essence that four of
us should accept the so-called German Democratic
Republic as one of the principal organs whereby
the German problem is to be solved. We cannot
accept that position.
We know that the German people would regard
as contaminated any decisions which were fastened
upon them through the interposition of the “Ger-
man People’s Republic.”
Mr. Molotov has said: “Only they themselves,
only the Germans, can really solve the German
problem. Any other solution of the German ques-
tion would be unreasonable and unfair to the Ger-
man people.”
Because we believe that premise, we are com-
pelled to reject the Soviet proposal and return
to that which the three Western powers support.
We urge that Mr. Molotov agree to create
quickly by free, all-German elections a German
goverm'nent which can genuinely speak for all
of Germany and thus provide the indispensable
basis for a peace that will last, because it will be
a peace of consent.
In his speech yesterday, the Soviet Foreign
Minister sought to divert us from the serious dis-
cussion of this urgent topic by injecting a series
of charges against the United States, Great Brit-
ain, and France, which he claimed “are trying
to form a military bloc directed against the Soviet
Union.”
I will not take time at this conference to reject
these charges in detail. There is nothing new in
them. The same familiar charges have been made
car after year in the United Nations. They
have been refuted time after time, year after year.
For example, Mr. Molotov sIaJys that $100 mil-
lion was appropriated by the . S. Congress for
“subversive’ activities within the Soviet satellite
countries. That charge, often made, was com-
pletel rejected when raised by Mr. Vyshinsky in
the nited Nations. I refute it again as being
totally untrue. That legislation has been utilized
solely for the purpose of assistance to refugees
ﬂeein from the Soviet bloc, such as the one mil-
lion w o, as I mentioned, ﬂed from East Germany
to the West. It is elementary kindness to assist
these refugees to make a new start in life.
Perhaps there would have been fewer of them
if, in 1948, the Soviet Union had allowed its satel-
lites to share the thousands of millions of dollars
which the United States made available to relieve
conditions of economic distress abroad. Perhaps
_ then, too, a Soviet mistake was made.
U. 5. Contributions to
Military Vieteriee
I would recall to the Soviet Foreign Minister
that the United States is one of the nations which
paid a very hea price for two German aggres-
sions. \Ve came into WVorld War I and we came
into World \Var II, when it seemed that German
militarism might gain decisive victories in Europe
and dominate the Eurasian continent.
It would not be proﬁtable for us here to engage
in unseemly competition as to the importance of
our relative contributions to the ultimate defeat of
Nazi Germany. That defeat required blood and
steel, and the United States contributed both.
There was a time when the Soviet Union paid
tribute to that contribution.
In li ht of that history, the United States feels
that it ias earned the right to shrug off, as foolish
chatter, the accusation that it now seeks to recreate
the very force that has twice so cruelly hurt it.
The United States is dedicating its material,
intellectual, and spiritual resources to building a
world of peace.
We took a leading part in creating the United
Nations. We take seriously our obligation under
that charter to refrain from the threat or use of
force against the territorial integrity or political
independence of any state. That obligation will
apply to Germany when she becomes a member
of the United Nations.
We take seriously the undertaking of that or-
ganization to insure that states which are not
members of the United Nations act in accordance
