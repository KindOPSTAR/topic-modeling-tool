Jul 1, 1953, are now estimated at less than 31
mil ion ba s, or about two million bags below the
anticipat requirements. If exports from Braml
should be maintained at last season’s levels the
United States Embassy in Rio de J aneiro foresees
a reduction in the Brazilian carry-over from 3.2
million bags, at the end of the last season, to 2.3
million bags this year, a record low ﬁgure.
Adjustment of su ply to demand 13 very slow
in the case of coffee Because the tree does not bear
until the ﬁfth to seventh ear after planting.
Low coﬂ'ee prices during t e 1930‘s and early
1940’s made it unprofita Is to plant new trees,
and it is estimated that Brazil suffered a net loss
of some 390 million trees during the decade 19:10—
50. Planting has been increasin rapidly durin
the post-war riod, but only a ut one-half o
the new trees ave yet come into bearing. _Much
of Brazil’s new planting was concentrated in the
state of Parana, and this was, unfortunately, the
area most affected b the recent frost. The Bra-
zilian Government as allocated funds to asmst
coffee producers to replant, but it will be several
years before these trees can contribute to the sup-
ply. New plantings have been increasmg 1n other
countries as well as in Brazil, however, and the
long run supply picture is better than it has been
for some years. _
The Department has learned of no speculation
or hoarding, either in the United States or in the
producing countries. A December 16 report, the
latest from the United States Embassy in R10 de
J aneiro on this subject, states that exports from
Brazil during the ﬁrst ﬁve months of the current
season (J uly—November 1953) amounted to 7.4
million bags compared with 6.9 million bags dur-
ing the same period last year, which would indicate
that coffee was moving normally and not berg?
withheld from market, at least during that peri .
You ask whether the Department of State has
made any effort to reach agreement with the coffee
producing nations to assure that adequate supplies
of coffee will be made available at reasonable
prices to meet the requirements of consumers in
the United States. The Department of State
takes a great interest in keeping coffee prices
within reach of the American consumer, since
coffee is one of the principal items of trade be-
tween the United States and Latin America, and
an expanding trade is in the interest of both. It
is my understanding that coffee prices have re-
ceded somewhat from the recent peak, and it is
my belief that the governments of the producing
countries will make every effort to bring prices
back to normal. I am informed that exports from
Colombia are moving at record levels and that
prospects for the 1954 Colombian crop are very
good. This will offset, to some extent, the antici-
pated short crop in Brazil.
As to steps which might be taken to relieve the
situation immediately, there does not appear to
be any practicable basis upon which the Govern-
ment of the United States might approach the
governments of producing countries with a re-
quest that they al ocate supplies or impose ceiling
prices. Coffee, like most agricultural cro 5 grown
in the United States, is produced by t ousands
of small farmers who customarily sell throu h
private trade channels. The large surplus stoc
once held by the Brazilian Government were liqui-
dated several years ago. The United States Gov-
ernment did impose ceiling prices on coffee during
the second lVorld War and durin the emer ency
following the outbreak of hosti ities in orea.
Coffee was one of the last items to be decontrolled,
and there was some criticism from the coffee-pro-
ducing countries because controls were being re-
laxed on rices of manufactured goods which they
customarily buy here while controls were retained
on the rice of coffee, one of their rincipal ex-
ports. ne of the ﬁrst acts of this A ministration
was to eliminate price controls, in the belief that
the free lay of market forces, operating through
rivate initiative, would result in the long run
1n the most satisfactory allocation of the nation’s
resources and the best protection of the consumer’s
interest. The authority for imposing price con-
trols no longer exists 1n the United States, and
this Government would be reluctant to request
action by other governments which it is not in a
position to reciprocate.
If the United States Government were to under-
take to negotiate an agreement with the coffee-
producing countries which would obligate them
to supply a speciﬁed quantity of coffee at a s eci-
fied price it would, necessarily, assume an oh i a-
tion to purchase the coffee at that price. glo
agency of the United States Government has au-
thority to assume such an obligation.
The United States Government, through the
Department of State, has been represented over
a number of years on the Sub-Committee on Coffee
of the Inter-American Economic and Social Coun-
cil of the Organization of American States. This
Committee, on which most producing countries of
the western hemisphere are represented, considers
coffee problems of mutual interest, and the United
States representative has repeatedly urged that
better statistical information be collected in the
producing countries, especially with respect to
new plantings of coffee trees, so that an accurate
determination could be made of the prospective
sup ly over a period of years, and crises either
of s10rtage or surplus avoided. This Committee
is purely an advisory body, but it has developed
an awareness on the part of the member govern-
ments of the need for expanding production, and
plantings of coffee trees have increased. The De-
partment will continue to urge producing coun-
tries to expand production until consumers’
requirements can be met at a price which they
can afford to pay.
Sincerely,
THRUS'I‘ON B. MoR'rON
