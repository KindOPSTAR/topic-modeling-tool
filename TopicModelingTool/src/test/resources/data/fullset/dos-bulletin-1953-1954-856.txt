One fact stands out stark and clear: Of all who
inhabit the lobe, only relatively small numbers—
only a handful even in Russia itself—are ﬁxed
in their determination to dominate the world by
force and fraud. Except for these groups in the
several nations, mankind everywhere—those who
still walk upright in freedom, those who hesitate
in neutralism, those who must bow to commu-
nism—mankind everywhere hungers for freedom,
for well-being, for peace. Now, how can a few
men thwart the will of hundreds of millions?
Because, answering to no judge in conscience or
in public opinion, the are engaged in a relentless
and highly organize world campaign of deceit,
subversmn, and terrorism. And, opposed to them,
there is no single, global effort to promote knowl-
ed e and cooperation.
hey preach a material do a that is abhorrent
to us, a dogma coated with alse Promises. And
they speak it with a sin 1e and a tireless voice,
while the free world s ea with diverse tongues
a message that deman s from each responsibi ity,
perseverance, and sacriﬁce.
Our op onents focus all the weight of govern-
ment on t e sin le objective they have chosen as
the next goal. a‘he free world uses government
for the furtherance of human happiness, a front
so bread that forward movement is at times almost
im erceptible.
'izo s read their falsehoods, the few who seek
world omination possess a global organism cease-
lessly enga ed in carrying out the orders of their
masters. 0 give the world the truth, the free
nations rely largely on the volunteer efforts of
individuals—efforts often weak because they are
intermittent and uncoordinated.
Possibly in no other way do the Communists so
clearly exhibit their fear of the free world achiev-
ing real unity as in their persistent efforts to divide
and thereby weaken us. They ex loit every dif-
ference of view among inde en ent nations to
make honest discussion false y appear, not as a
valued characteristic of free systems, but as indica-
tion of mutual hatreds and antagonisms. This
doctrine of divide and conquer they apply not only
as between nations but amon groups and indi-
viduals of the same nation. hey ceaselessly at-
tack our social, industrial, educational, and spirit-
ual institutions and encourage every type of in-
ternecine struggle of whatever kind.
It is very easy to become an unwitting tool or
ally of such conniving. For example, there is
no other subject or purpose in which Americans
are so completely united as in their opposition to
communism. Yet, my friends, and I say this
sadly, is there any other subject that seems, at this
moment, to be the cause of so much division among
us as does the matter of defending our freedoms
from Communist subversion? To this problem
we must apply more knowledge and intellect and
less prejudice and passion. Above all, we must
not permit any one to divert our attention from
the main battle and to inspire quarrels that even-
tually ﬁnd good citizens bitterl opposed to other
good citizens, when basically ail would like to be
joined in effective opposition to communism.
Now, we must of course require from the govern-
mental organizations set up for our internal and
external securit the utmost in vigilance, energy,
and loyalty. e must make certain through con-
stant examination that they are so erforming
their duties. Let us provide any additional laws
or machineryl necessary to rotect America—re-
membering t at protecting erica includes also
the protection of every American in his American
rights. Let us not lose faith in our own institu-
tions and in the essential soundness of the Ameri-
can citizenr , lest we—divided among ourselves—
thus serve t e interests and advance the purposes
of those seeking to destroy us.
The Soviet Communists claim that their cause is
timeless, possibly requiring an entire era to achieve
desired results. But they know that the truth of
freedom possesses an unchanging validity and a.
cumulative power as more millions learn of it.
So the dictators seek to den to the world the time
and opportunity to learn t e truth of both com-
munism and freedom. The power-hungry few are
therefore persistently aggressive.
In this Situation, we, t e American people, stand
committed to two far-reaching policies—
First and foremost: We are dedicated to the
building of a cooperative peace, based upon truth,
justice, and fairness.
Second: To pursue this pu ose effectively, we
seek the strengthening of erica—and her
friends—in love of libert , in knowledge and com-
prehension, in a de en able prosperity widely
shared, and in a mi itary posture adequate for
security.
In these two policies, there is no iota of aggres-
sion, no intent to exploit others or to deny them
their rightful place and s ace in the world. This
consideration of others—t is dedication to a world
ﬁlled with peaceful, self-respectin nations—ﬁnds
its only opposition in militant tota itarianism.
It we are to work intelligently in the cause of
freedom, we must study and understand these
factors in the world turmoil.
Even when so armed with knowledge, it is not
easy for the free world’s representatives to nego-
tiate successfully with those who either cannot or
will not see the truth or admit the existence of
obvious fact.
But surely, even the men in the Kremlin must
realize that before all mankind now lies a grand
prospect of a far better life for ever one. Its
achievement requires only that the scientists of
every nation concentrate on the means to a plenti-
ful life rather than on the tools of sudden death;
that the millions now under arms be released to
fruitful work; that industries of war be con-
verted to the production of useful goods. We
