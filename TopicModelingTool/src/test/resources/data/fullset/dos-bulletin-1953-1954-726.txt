The United States and Canada as Neighbors and Partners
by Vincent Massey
Governor General of Ua/nada‘
First may I thank you for the high compliment
you have paid my country this morning and for
the warmth of your welcome which has touched
me ver deepl . I feel greatly honored that I
should be asked] to meet, on this occasion, the mem-
bers of the two great legislative bodies assembled
in this Chamber. I am conscious at this mo-
ment—and who would not be—of the relation
between the course of world events and the deci-
sions which are arrived at here. You have given
me a rare privilege today, and I am very grateful
to ou for it.
feel no stranger in this city. I spent several
very pleasant years here long ago, when my task
was to set up the ﬁrst diplomatic mission from
Canada to your country, and my privilege to serve
as envoy. This was when the nations of our
Commonwealth commenced to send their own
representatives abroad—ﬁrst to this capital—th
concerned with his country’s business but all look-
ing on the same sovereign as the head of the
Commonwealth.
As Canadian Minister I bore credentials from
our sovereign. I now come to you again as a
representative of the Crown—this time not in a
post abroad but in one at home. “Governor Gen-
eral” is, perhaps a rather misleading term. A
person holding t at ofﬁce does not govern. His
functions, indeed, can easily be confused with those
of governors in some other countries who, unlike
him, are administrators. We, no less than your-
selves, are, of course, a completely free and inde-
pendent nation. Canada alone amon the
countries of the Americas is a constitutiona mon-
archy. Under our system the Governor General
represents the soverei , who is the head of our
Canadian State, and With us, all actions in the ﬁeld
of government from the passing of legislation to
the delivering of mail are performed, to quote the
ancient phrase we use, “On Her Majesty’s service.”

In June of last year, an event took place of high
iilgniﬁcance to us in Canada. In none of Her
a'esty’s realms was her coronation celebrated
with greater fervor. May I say that as your
neighbors, we Canadians were greatly touched by
the deep and widespread interest dis layed by the
American people in this event. ng I be per-
mitted to convey to you the sincere appreciation of
the Queen’s subjects in Canada, for your sensitive
understanding of a ceremony which meant so
much to us and, we believe, much to the world.
Declaration of Independence a Challenge
On an occasion such as this, made possible b
your graceful hospitality, one is reminded of a 1
that our Commonwealth owes to you, and, indeed,
has owed ever since you established your free Re-
public here on this continent. The principles en-
shrined in your Declaration of Independence and
in your Constitution were a challen e to the
British peoples in the 18th century, an since, to
seek out the sources of their ancient freedom——
sources from which we all have fed. Thus, you
helped us to cultivate our own institutions under
the Crown, which to us is a symbol of freedom and
duty. We are grateful to you for aiding us in the
Commonwealth to preserve and enrich our own
wa of life.
ven at the very beginning, the noble emotions
inspired by the declaration of the fathers of this
Republic, and the solid framework of the Consti-
tution which they built, were comprehended and
welcomed by many in Great Britain. I belong to
a club in London—a stron hold of the Whigs in
the 18th century—man 0 whose members used
to receive the news of eneral Washington’s vic-
tories with undisguised satisfaction. One of them,
indeed, boasted that he had drunk the General’s
health every night during the course of the war
in America.
To say that you in the United States and we in
Canada have much in common, is a venerable
