developments that have taken place over the past
year. They noted that the gold and dollar reserves
of other countries generally have been rising; that
there has been a marked improvement in the in-
ternal economic stability of many countries; and
that these favorable develo ments have made pos-
sible some relaxation 0 import restrictions.
Nevertheless, it was agreed that the recovery to
economic health has not progressed equally for all
countries. What is needed, it was concluded, is the
creation of a more ﬂexible system of trade and
payments throughout the world which would offer
greater resilience to changing circumstances and
which would contribute dynamically towards ris-
ing standards of living. It was agreed that much
of the necessary preparation for such an advance
has already been accomplished by the work of the
Commission on Foreign Economic Policy in the
United States, by the roposals of the Common-
wealth Economic Con erence. and by discussions
within the Organization for European Economic
Cooperation.
6. In the meantime, it was agreed that it is
essential that pressing, but possibly temporary,
economic problems should not be solved by expedi-
ents which might make more difficult the advance
on a broad front that was held to be necessary.
One immediate roblem which received close con-
sideration was that raised by the accumulation of
large agricultural surpluses. Special incentives
and favorable weather conditions have operated
in varying degrees to enlarge these surpluses. The
Ministers of both countries recognized that if
surpluses were to be disposed of without regard to
the impact on normal trade, great damage might
be done not only to the commerce of Canada and
the United States but also to the world economy.
The Ministers reafﬁrmed that it is the continuing
policy of their respective governments, in dispos-
ing of agricultural surpluses abroad, to consult
with interested countries and not to interfere with
normal commercial marketings. They stated that
it is their settled intention that any extraordinary
measures that might be adopted to reduce sur-
pluses should result in greater consumption and
should augment, and not displace, normal quanti-
tiesd of agricultural products entering into world
tra e.
7. In advancing toward a freer s stem of world
trade and payments, it was agree that existing
international organizations would continue to
play an important role. The valuable work al-
ready done by the International Monetary Fund,
the International Bank, and the Contracting
Parties of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, was recognized. Ministers noted with sat-
isfaction the arrangements which have recently
been made within the Fund to enable its resources
to be used more effectively. Acknowledgment
was also made of the useful service that has been
performed by GA'I'I‘ in developing a code of com-
mercial conduct and in providing a forum where
multilateral tariﬂ' cements could be ne otiated
and where the pro lems of commercia policy
could be discussed.
8. It was appreciated that it is for countries
whose currencies are now inconvertible to decide
when and under what circumstances the might
wish to make them convertible. It was a so real-
ized that enlightened economic policies on the
part of the United States and Canada will ma-
terially contribute to establishing and maintain-
ing broader freedom of trade and payments
throughout the world. Because of the importance
of that objective, the United States and Canadian
Ministers warmly welcomed the evidence of a de-
sire in many countries to take decisive steps
toward the restoration of a broad area of con-
vertibility, and expressed a willingness to do
their part to help in making such a movement
successful.
9. The discussions at this meeting of the Joint
Committee were marked by the friendliness and
candor which are characteristic of relations be-
tween the two countries. At the invitation of the
Canadian Ministers the second meeting of the
Joint Committee will be held in Ottawa.
U.S. Views on Situation
In Indochina
1V ews Conference Statement by Secretary Dulles
Press release 154 dated March 23
I do not expect that there is going to be a Com-
munist victory in Indochina. By that I don’t
mean that there may not be local affairs where one
side or another will win victories, but in terms of
a Communist domination of Indochina, I do not
accept that as a probability.
There is a very gallant and brave struggle bein
carried on at Dien-Bien-Phu b the French an
Associated States Forces. It is an outpost. It
has alread inﬂicted very heavy damage upon the
enemy. T e French and Associated States Forces
at Dien-Bien-Phu are writing, in my opinion, a
notable chapter in military history. Dian-Bien-
Phu is, as I say, an outpost position where only a
very small percentage of the French Union forces
is engaged and where a very considerable percent-
age of the forces of the Viet Minh is engaged.
Broadly speaking, the United States has, under
its reviously known policy, been extending aid
in t e form of money and materiel to the French
Union Forces in Indochina. As their requests for
materiel become known and their need for that
becomes evident, we respond to it as rapidly as
we can. Those requests have assumed various
forms at various times. But I think that we have
responded in a very prompt and effective manner
to those requests.
