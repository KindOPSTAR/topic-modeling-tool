Thus far the United States, on behalf of the
entire family of American Re ublics, has borne
most of that ﬁnancial burden. owever, by their
contributions to United Nations pro ams, by
their refusal to sell strategic materials ehind the
Iron Curtain, our sister American Republics are
showing their wish to participate in th1s ﬁnancial
burden each in proportion to its own ability.
\Ve thank God that our programs of aid to Latin
America are of a very different nature than the
Marshall plan. They were undertaken long be-
fore that plan and other forms of aid similar to
it were developed. Before the world Communist
conspiracy was recognized as the menace which it
is, we were dedicated to the olicy of contributing
to strengthening the economies of the other Ameri-
can Republics. We shall still be dedicated to
that policy when the Communist menace has dis-
appeared.
What Is and Should Be Our Contrlbutlon
in the Economic Field?
I come now to the question, all-important to us,
of what is today and what should be the contribu-
tion of this Government to that great crusade
toward industrialization and expanding commerce
that is going on throughout Latin America, and
whose achievements have been so notable.
Vast sums of capital have been productively in-
vested in Latin America in the past 2 decades.
Opportunities for further equally productive in-
vestment are enormous. However it is important
that we not overlook the gratifying fact that, as
great as are these opportunities for investment,
the reservoirs of available Latin American and
foreign private capital available for investment
in the other American Republics greatly exceed
the total of these opportunities. It is no exaggera-
tion to say that the amounts of private capital
that could be made available from domestic and
foreign sources for investment in Latin America
are many times greater than the sums of invest-
ment capital that could possibly be absorbed pro-
ductively in the area at present.
That capital will venture itself when and to the
degree that the reassuring conditions to which I
have referred are established and assured in the
areas of investment. That, of course, is a matter
lying entirely within the jurisdiction of the various
interested governments.
In sayin these things I am not overlooking the
fact that t ere are im ortant ﬁelds in which new
investment will contri ute effectively and immedi-
ately to our common goal but into which we must
recognize that private ca ital will not venture
even under favorable conditions. It is to our in-
terest that we make capital available for invest-
ment on a sound basis in these ﬁelds. As Presi-
dent Eisenhower stated in his message of March
30 to which I have referred, the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development will
be the primary institution of this tyge of public
ﬁnancing. Nevertheless, he said, an I consider
this exceedingly important:
The Export-Import Bank will consider on their merits
applications for the ﬁnancing of development projects
which are not being made by the International Bank, and
which are in the special interest of the United States, are
economically sound, are within the capacity of the pro-
spective borrower to repay and within the prudent loaning
capacity of the bank.
Thus, if the policies and actions of our respec-
tive governments are sound and enlightened, those
quantities of investment capital which are needed
and which can be constructively absorbed will be
available in Latin America.
More important than the creation of new indus-
tries and other sources of economic strength is the
effective exploitation and utilization of the vast
assets now available in Latin America. It is ele-
mental that the existing economy to which addi-
tions are made through new investment should be
sound and well administered.
In this all-important ﬁeld we hope that our
technical assistance programs will make an effec-
tive contribution.
As I have said, access to ever-widening markets
is essential to the establishment of new industry
and the growth of those already existing. One of
the most important contributions of our govern-
ment and of this Administration would be to 'oin
in an effective and orderly program designe to
give foreign industry greater access to markets not
only in the United States but in other countries as
well. We feel that this can be best achieved
through a program of reciprocal reduction in
trade barriers.
In closing, I want to repeat somethin that I
have touched on several times earlier in t is talk.
As reat as is our desire to contribute effectively
to t e establishment of strong and self-reliant
economies elsewhere in this hemisphere, the pri-
mary responsibilit in that ﬁeld lies upon the na-
tions involved. t is primarily through their
foresight. industry, and self-discipline that this
goal will be achieved. I found com lete and con-
rageous realization of this fact at aracas. The
credit for their great achievements in the past and
for those which lie ahead belongs overwhelmingly
to the Latin American peoples themselves.
