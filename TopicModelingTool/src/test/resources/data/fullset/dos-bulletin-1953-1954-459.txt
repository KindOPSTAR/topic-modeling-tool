Press release 134 dated March 15
The United States ﬁled on March 15, pursuant
to article 66 of the Statute of the International
Court of Justice, a written statement, furnishing
information concerning the questions submitted
for advisory opinion to the International Court of
Justice by General Assembly Resolution of De-
cember 9, 1953.3 The questions are ﬁrst, whether
the General Assembly may legally, for whatever
grounds, refuse to give effect to awards of com-

nsation made b the U.N. Administrative Tri-
ﬁiinal, and, secon , on what grounds it may rely.
The decision to refer these questions to the
International Court of Justice was made by the
General Assembl as a result of considering
awards totaling about $180,000 made by the Ad-
ministrative Tribunal of the United Nations dur-
ing 1953 to certain U.S. citizens, staff members of
the United Nations, who were dismissed by the
Secretary-General after they had refused to an-
swer various (Huestions concerning Communist
Party members lip or activity, and espionage,
which the had been asked by a subcommittee of
the U.S. enate. As is clear from the questions,
which are quoted below, the merits of those awards
is not the issue before the Court. The U.S. state-
ment does not discuss the merits of the awards.
The U.S. position, in opposition to payment of
the awards, was made known last fall when it was
put before the General Assembly by the U.S. dele-
gate, Congressman James P. Richards.‘ There is
nothing new to add on this aspect of the matter.
The text of the questions put to the Court is:
(1) Having regard to the Statute of the United Nations
Administrative Tribunal and to any other relevant instru-
ments and to the relevant records, has the General Assem-
bly the right on any grounds to refuse to give effect to an
award of compensation made by that Tribunal in favour
of a staﬂ! member of the United Nations whose contract
of service has been terminated without his assent?
(2) If the answer given by the Court to question (1)
is in the afﬁrmative, what are the principal grounds upon
whicpl the General Assembly could lawfully exercise such
a rig t?
The U.S. statement answers the ﬁrst question
“yes.” It examines the origin, nature, and charter
basis of the Administrative Tribunal and con-
cludes that it remains subsidiary to the General
Assembly which established it, which remains re-
sponsible for its work, and which must have power
to correct its errors. It recites the precedent of
the action of the League of Nations Assembly
which, in 1946, refused to give effect to 13 awards
of compensation made by the Lea e of Nations
Administrative Tribunal. The gtliatute of the
United Nations Tribunal was modeled on that of
the League.
The statement points out that the U.N. Tribunal
lacks a fully developed and accepted body of law,
a long judicial development, or even a system of
appellate or internal review which are among the
cornerstones of such national institutions as the
U.S. Federal Courts or the French Conseil d’Etat
and which minimize the chances of error. Only
the General Assembly can assure the proper de-
velopment of the Tribunal and retrieve errors it
may make.
The statement emphasizes that the budgetary
