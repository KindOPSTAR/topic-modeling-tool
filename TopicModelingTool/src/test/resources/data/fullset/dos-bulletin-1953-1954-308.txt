world. Countries rely u n our exports of wheat,
tobacco, cotton, fats, an oils, and other products
far more heavily than before the war. By the
same token, they ﬁnd it more important than ever
to sell goods in our markets in order to ay for the
products they are buying from us. Conversely,
our farms, our industries, and our labor forces de-
pend heavily on foreign markets.
New Industrial Ralatlanchlpa
In this connection it is not without si ificance
that the industrial nations of the worl emer d
from the war with new relationships with the izeess
advanced areas. Nor has the develo ment been
all in favor of the so-called underdeve oped areas.
For one thin , all of the industrial nations, ar-
ticularly the nited States, have found themse ves
far more dependent upon imported minerals and
other raw materials than ever before. Expanded
consumer demands and extraordinary wartime
needs have used such great quantities of irreplace-
able raw materials that the industrial nations are
being forced to turn outside their borders to ﬁll
an increasing proportion of their needs. At the
same time new expanding markets have been
opening all over the world for the exports of the
industrial nations. The peo les of the Far East,
Latin America, and Africa ave been stirred to
new aspirations for economic rowth. They are
deﬁnitel on the march. In the next generation
or two, ese areas are bound to ow spectacularly
by one means or another, ant?r as they grow to
draw upon the roductive facilities of the indus-
trial nations. ew forces exist which may create
a level of world trade hi her than has ever pre-
viously been contemplatetﬁ
One added in redient in the new situation needs
to be mentione . The shock of wartime devasta-
tion and the herculean job of reconstruction which
many countries faced in the ears following the
war made them reluctant to a andon the wartime
controls they had been forced to assume. The
were afraid of ra id change, fearful of competi-
tion, uncertain o the future. In the past year,
this has changed. There is, as I mentioned, a.
great deal of talk abroad of the risks of an Ameri-
can recession, but there is developing a new conﬁ-
dence among forei nations in their abilit to
meet the trade angnpaymenm difliculties w ich
movements in the business cycle could bring. And
there is a far wider recognition among govern-
ments of the world than ever before in the wisdom
of avoiding direct governmental controls in the
economy, a much greater appreciation of the
hidden costs and the debilitating effects of such
controls, and a much greater willingness to expose
themselves to the risks of competition in world
markets.
The relative position of our country in this
changing world is the constant problem. Some of
our foreign economic policies have been adapted to
these changes. The process of change and adapta-
tion has been iecemeal and disjointed. Aid
programs have een framed under pressure of
emergencies, without adequate time to ponder over
how these programs fitted together with our tariff
policies, our overseas investment olicies, our mer-
chant marine policies, or our omestic agricul-
tural policies. At the same time, our tariff poli-
cies have developed in their own separate groove;
our merchant marine policies have remained in
their compartment; our domestic agricultural pro-
grams have continued to develop in their partic-
ular setting and with their particular set of pre-
occupations; and so on. There has been a great
deal of hauling and pulling among these programs
and very little ada tation among them.
\Vhat the Randu 1 Commission has tried to do
is to fit these policies together into a reasonabl
consistent whole. This effort, taken by itsel ,
would not be ii spectacular accomplishment. Any
student of international economic affairs who was
assigned the task might have produced a reason-
ably coherent proposal reconciling the various
programs which make up our foreign economic
policy. But the report of the Randall Commis-
sion was not written in an ivory tower. It was
actually written by a Commission of 17 men chosen
from representative fields of American life—busi-
ness, academic, and government. Ten of the mem-
bers were drawn from the 2 Houses of the Con-
gress—6 Republicans and 4 Democrats. Seven
were drawn from other walks of American life.
Collectively, they were able to bring to this study
an intimate knowledge of the problems of foreign
relations, and of American agriculture, industry,
and labor. These 17 men, therefore, framed their
views with a full realization not only of what was
necessary but also of what was feasible in the de-
velo ment of a foreign economic policy. Viewed
in t is light, the document must be regarded as
quite remarkable.
Naturally, there are dissents and qualiﬁcations
throughout the re ort. It would be strange if
there were not. Vi ithout in any measure attempt-
ing to minimize the basis or effect of these dissents,
the fact remains the members seem to be largely
in agreement that constructive action is desirable
in large areas of our foreign economic licy.
The Commission a proached its tas with “the
sobering realization t int the policies pursued and
the actions taken by the United States in respect
to foreign economic olicy profoundly influence
the destinies of all of) the peoples of the world.”
Prlnclpal Recommendations of the Report
The Randall Report is bound together by a tini-
fying philosophy. The Commission observes that
ours is one of the most dynamic. resilient. and cre-
ative economies in the world. The strength of our
economy, the Commission says. has been due to
three fundamental principles: (1) The freest pos-
