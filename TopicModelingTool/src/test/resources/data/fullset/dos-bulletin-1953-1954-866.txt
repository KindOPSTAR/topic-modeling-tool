And in our own day it is clear that many prob-
lems cannot be solved by any nation alone or even
by small cups of nations. It is by a signiﬁcant
act of faith that the preamble of the charter of
the United Nations begins with the words, “We
the peoples of the United Nations”—faith in the
lessons of history, not least in the history of our
own United States. The U.N. Charter is based
not on an ideology such as dialectical materialism
but on the grim determination “to save succeeding
generations from the scourge of war,” whose en-
ines of destruction have since become more awful
t an their scientist designers intended or ex-
pected. From the viewpolnt of political science I
suppose the UN. structure is sound in its ﬂexibil-
ity and in the inclusion of specialized agencies
created to deal with critical problems in food and
agriculture, world health, meteorology, civil avia-
tion, labor, trade, telecommunications, and the like.
It seems relevant to recall that “Ideolo ies divide;
projects unite.” The exploitability of t e divisive-
ness of ideologies is now apparent. The cohesive
property of projects is increasin ly manifest in
the operations of multinationa staffs of the
United Nations and several of the specialized
agencies, as in increasing and improving food
production, health and sanitation programs, and
technical assistance in underdeveloped areas.



Figure 11. Hemisphere with the northern limits of the
United States at its edge
This hemisphere, which has the corners of Maine and
the State of Washington at its northern edge, is centered
near 38" S., 98° W., in the South Paciﬁc. It includes a
very narrow strip of Canada, all of Mexico, Central Amer-
ica and South America and Antarctica, and the more
densely populated part of Australia. The white-ocean
area on the Miller projection map at the right delineates
the same hemisphere.
If Haushofer and Hitler or the Japanese mili-
tary strategists ever made intelligent use of globes,
I have never been able to discover it. What they
might have done or might have decided not to
attempt, if they had visualized geographical re-
lationships and situations more accurately, we can
only guess. But it is clear that misconceptions
of global relations, concerning which many people
speak very glibly—on the part of men in high
places either in this or almost any other large
country—can so distort, or in the past have so
distorted, the facts of another nation’s capabilities
and intentions as to compromise peace or to start
or lose wars. This is only one of the reasons why
ﬂat-map thinking about world relationships may
be treacherously deceptive and politically and
socially dangerous.
We cannot really comprehend many of our own
national problems except in their true relation-
ships to the whole. As a corollary it is the
writer’s conviction that:
He who would solve world problems must
understand them;
He who would understand world problems
must visualize them; and
He who would visualize world problems
should study them on the spherical sur-
face of a globe.


Figure 12. The sum of all hemispheres containing all
of the United States
The sum of all hemispheres that include the entire
United States is indicated in reverse on this world map
on the Bricscmeister equal-area projection, by bringing
out the only area no part of which can be included in a
hemisphere that embraces all of the 48 States and the
District of Celumbia.
The outermost points of the United States are marked
by the letters A. B, C, D and E; and the points antipoda-l
to them (as if one were to stick a hatpin ﬁve times through
the center of the earth, coming out on the other side)
are lettered A', B', 0', D’, and E'. The dotted line
passing through A and B, across Canada and west of
Africa and crossing Australia, is the great circle that
outlines the hemisphere shown in ﬁgure 11. A series
of hemispheres, each including all of the United States,
can similarly be deﬁned, bounded by the great circles
passing through BC, CD (not shown), DE, and EA, which
are shoum on the map in distinctive dashed lines, each
completely encircling the earth.
The only area which lies wholly outside all of these
U.S. hemispheres is the area in the south Indian Ocean
bounded by these curves, which are tangent to' an inverted
outline mirror image of the United States (which is
therefore but little larger than the United States itself),
and is therefore the only portion of the earth no part
of which can be included in a hemisphere embracing the
entire United States.
The continuous curve in a solid line is the line of the
centers of all hemispheres which barely include all of
the United States. Therefore any hemisphere centered
at a point inside that came will include the United States
and somewhat more.
