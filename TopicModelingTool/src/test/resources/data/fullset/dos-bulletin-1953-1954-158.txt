and a number of other pieces of special legislation.
Under this legislation we are now conducting ex-
changes of about 8,000 people a year with over 70
countries of the free world.
Let me tell you a bit about who these 8,000 people
are and what it is they do.
Two-thirds are carefully selected people from
other countries who are studying, teaching in our
schools and colle es, lecturing, or carrying on
s cialized researc . They are young people like
til): deputy chief of the Le islative Reference
Service of the Government of ndia who has this
year completed work on his Ph. D. in the ﬁeld of
public administration at American Universit ; or
the oﬁicial of the bank of Thailand who is stu ying
economics at the tharton School of Finance in
Philadel hia; or the head of a reformato in
Egypt w o is studying juvenile delinquency or a
year at the Univer51ty of Minnesota. Three-
fourths of these foreign students are, as the above
examples indicate, not students in their home
country, but already embarked on professional
careers.
We also bring elementa and secondary school-
teachers to this country. lSyome of them, especially
from the English speaking countries, swap jobs
with their American counterparts in our public
schools. Others, like the instructor and curricu-
lum planner for a number of rural schools in Cuba,
come to observe our educational methods, in this
case our methods of teaching vocational education.
Still others, like the head of the Physics Depart-
ment at the University of Oslo in Norway, are
lecturing in our colleges or are carrying on ad-
vanced research in a great variety of ﬁelds, im-
portant among which are the medical sciences and
American literature and history.
Another group of people whom we brin from
overseas are the present leaders of thoug t and
opinion in these countries—outstanding newsmen,
overnment oﬁicials, members of national legis-
atures, and ople with wide inﬂuence in labor,
business, an social and community welfare. It
might interest you to know, for example, that 71
of the present members of the German parliament
came to the United States under our program in
the last few years. Because of their positions,
most of these ople can come for only a short
time, usually a at 3 months, and they 3 end this
time estabhshin contacts with their erican
coworkers and 0 serving recent developments in
various parts of the United States. To give you
a few examples of who these people are, let me
cite some w o are in this country right now: a
member of Parliament from England; three labor
leaders from Finland; the political editor of a
newspaper in Dusseldorf, Germany; the director
of what might be the counterpart of our Farm
and Home Hour on the Japanese radio; and the
chief labor oﬂicer in the Ministry of Labor of the
Gold Coast Government.
One of our projects for foreign newsmen is of
particular interest. In 1946, the Virginia Press
Association decided to bring two French news-
papermen to the United States as its guests for 3
months. The association worked out the details
of this project with the State De artment, and
our mission in France helped ﬁn two suitable
candidates. The expenses of their trip were
shared by the Virginia Press Association and the
French newspapers from which the journalists
came. During their 3 months’ stay in Virginia
the two French newsmen accompanied members 0
the news )aper staff on their regular assignments,
became t oroughly familiar wnth desk and edi-
torial procedures, lived most of the time in the
homes of fellow journalists, and participated fully
in the life of the community.
During all this time they were writing articles
about their experiences for their newspapers in
France. Following this pattern, we are now
bringing about 18 journalists a year from different
countries. We pay their travel and the newspa er
on which they work pays their expenses while t iey
are in the United States. One of the most success-
ful of these trips was an arrangement under which
Ronald McKie of the Sydney I)az'l Telegraph
in Australia spent 3 months with t e Winston-
Salem Journal and Twin City Sentinel. McKie’s
articles appearing in the Journal-Sentinel, touch-
ing as they did on every aspect of American life
from the cleanliness of our restaurants to the
nature of our political campaigns, became the sub-
ject of frequent letters to the editor. Some of
the more cynical writers indicated a strong belief
that McKie existed only as a creature of the editor’s
warped imagination and that this was merely a
clever device whereby the Journal-Sentinel could
give vent to some unorthodox views about the
ife of the community without becomin the target
of brickbats and Mason jars thrown by disgruntled
readers.‘
Amerlcans Abroad
The other one-third of our 8,000 exchan are
outstanding Americans who go abroad or pur-
g‘oses similar to those of their foreign counterparts.
hese representative Americans come from all 48
of our States. Through their professional activ-
ities and their informal contacts, they are able
to demonstrate and share our American achieve-
ments and give ﬁrsthand information about our
country. They bring back and put to use the
knowledge of foreign cultures, achievements, and
problems acquired during their visit overseas.
One of the fundamental concepts of the ex-
change program and one which I think contributes
immeasurably to its effectiveness is the fact that
it is a truly cooperative undertaking. In many
