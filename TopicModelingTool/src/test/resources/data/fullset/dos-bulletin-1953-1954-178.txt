ter-national rights and obligations it shall assume?
Again, the national assembly and the all-German
government.
As I read the lan, the entire emphasis seems to
be on enabling reel elected German authorities
to make the crucial ecisions all along the road to
a ﬁnal German settlement. That observation
brin me to comment on another point upon
whic 1 Mr. Molotov has commented, namely, this
problem of free elections.
Any proper plan for German uniﬁcation must
provide adequate safeguards of election freedoms.
This it seems is covered by the proposal that we
are considering. Conditions of genuine freedom
must exist not only on election day itself, but for
a reasonable period of time before the votes are
cast, and also after the elections, in order to insure
that there shall be no reprisals, and that everyone
may safely vote his convictions.
To take care of this latter point, the United
Kin dom plan would maintain the supervisory
mac iinery in operation until the all-German gov-
ernment assumes full control and is able to assure
democratic freedoms throughout Germany in ac-
cordance with its constitution.
We can be sure that the 50 million inhabitants
of Western Germany are willing and anxious to
cooperate to insure such free elections. The same
can be said for my Government and also, I believe,
for the French and British Governments. The
18 million inhabitants of the Soviet zone deserve
the same kind of assurances, and I trust that my
Soviet colleague will agree to the importance of
providing those assurances
Mr. Molotov has made some observations about
the pending roposal which seem to me to imply
a lack of ful understanding of that r0 osal, or
ossibly, I might suggest, the need of urt ier clar-
iﬁcation of the proposal. I will not attempt to go
into those matters myself, because I am conﬁdent
that Mr. Eden, who submitted the plan, will him-
self deal with these matters. But as I read the
plan, it is not subject to the t pe of objections
which Mr. Molotov has indicate , and I hope that,
on the basis of further clariﬁcations, he would ﬁnd
that the plan itself, at least in its broad outlines,
is reasonable and one that we could proceed to
adopt as providing a way of bringing an end to
this dangerous condition of the continued partition
of Germany.
Problom ot Socurlty
Let me now turn to what I referred to as the
second aspect of the problem, that is the roblem
of security. We want Germany uniﬁed, but also
we want to be sure that a united Germany will be
a peaceful Germany. As I have said, the elapsed
time since the armistice should enable us now
calmly—and I ho e wisely—to consider how best
to achieve this in ispensable result.
On this point, history has much to teach us. It
teaches us that a stable peace cannot be achieved by
some countries imposing upon other countries dis-
criminatory restrictions. These methods fail
their very nature. They fail because the presen
a direct challenge to the spirit of nationa ism, and
themselves. They provoke efforts to demonstrate
sovereign equality. The very provisions which
are des1 ed to create controls in themselves breed
international lawlessness and violence.
The tragic failures of the past should warn us
not to resort here to the methods that have so often
been tried and as often failed. If we do not want
a revival of German militarism and an excess of
nationalism, we must ourselves admit the natural
and proper desire of the German people to be
equals in the family of nations. We must enable
them to contribute to a system of security, which,
threatenin none, defends all.
Our pro lem consists, most of all, in ﬁndin a
worthy outlet for the great energy and the vitality
of the German people. Whether we like it or not,
that vitality is a fact. It is a fact that cannot be
forcibly repressed for long, and it is a fact which
need not destroy the welfare of all of Europe, but
which can be brought to serve that welfare.
The essential thing is to ﬁnd a way in which the
energies of all of the European countries which
form a natural community will be pooled in com-
mon constructive tasks rather than perverted to
struggles by one to dominate the other.
T at vision is already being translated into
reality. Under the leadership of France. six na-
tions of continental Europe are establishing a
community. Already, the Coal and Steel Com-
munit exists. The same six countries have
signe to create a defense community, and other
aspects of community association are being
actively explored.
U. K. Support tor Dotonso Communlty
We have welcomed the steps which the United
Kingdom has taken to associate itself with and
su port this community. The United States also,
ltliiough not itself a European power, would asso-
ciate itself durany with the communit through
the North Atlantic Treaty, which, I recall, is much
more than a mere military alliance.
The Soviet Union professes to fear that this new
community which is being born might be danger-
ous to it. This community, it is true, will make
Europe healthy, more prosperous, and in that
sense more strong, but that is nothing to fear if at
the same time Europe is made more peaceful.
That is the purpose and that would be the sure
result. No more will there be national armies to
ﬁght each other and to invade others in a uest for
national triumphs. There will be only t 0 com-
mon army so interlocked that no single member of
the communit could in ractice commit armed
aggression. here woul be no more German
Army. There would be no German General Staﬂ,
