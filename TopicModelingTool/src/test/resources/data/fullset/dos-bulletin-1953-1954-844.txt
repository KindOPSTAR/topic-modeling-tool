Thermonuclear Tests in
Paciﬁc Trust Territory
STATEMENT BY HENRY CABOT LODGE, JR.
U.S. REPRESENTATIVE TO THE U.N-
U.S./UN. press release 1917 dated May 14
The United States Government is very so
indeed that some inhabitants of the Marshal
Islands ap arently have suﬁ‘ered ill effects from
the recent t ermonuclear tests in the Paciﬁc prov-
ing grounds, as described in the petition to the
United Nations. This is a matter of real and deep
concern to the American people and overnment,
who take very seriously our responsibi ities toward
the inhabitants of the Trust Territory of the Pa-
ciﬁc Islands.
I can assure them, as well as the members of the
United Nations, that the authorities in charge are
doing everything humanl possible to take care
of everyone who was in t e area aﬂ'ected by the
unexpected falling of radioactive materials caused
by a shift in the wind during the March 1 test.
The 236 Marshallese citizens in the affected area
were immediately 'ven the same medical exami-
nation as the American personnel of the test group
who were similarly exposed. They were romptly
evacuated to the United States Naval tation at
Kwajalein, where their needs were immediately
provided for b the United States Navy. In addi-
tion, a team 0 medical experts from the Atomic
886
