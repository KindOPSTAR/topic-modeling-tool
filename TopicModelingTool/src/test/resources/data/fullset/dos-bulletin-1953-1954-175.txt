Therefore, I say, let us get on with our work.
Let us truly discharge that responsibility on which
the hope of millions center.
STATEMENT OF JANUARY 21
It is proposed by the Soviet Union that there
be a ﬁve-power conference which would include
the four of us plus the Foreign Minister of Com-
munist China to consider “measures for reducing
international tensions.”
If I understand rightly what Mr. Molotov has
said, this pro osed meeting of the so-called “ﬁve
great powers’ is desi ed primarily to establish
and implement the principle that these ﬁve powers
have a special mandate to run the affairs of the
world.
Mr. Molotov pointed out that the Charter of
the United Nations gives special rights to the ﬁve
gowers by makin them permanent members of the
ecurit Counci . From this, Mr. Molotov de-
duces t at they have worldwide responsibilities
which should bring them together in a ﬁve- ower
conference which would be held outside the rame-
work of the United Nations.
Mr. Molotov should, however, remember what
I am sure the rest of us remember—and it so hap-
pens that all four of us were in San Francisco 1n
1945—that the conference which created the
United Nations rejected the concept of world
dominance b ﬁve powers. It was, it is true,
agreed that the ﬁve powers should be rmanent
members of the Security Council—but it was also
agreed six other nations should be members of that
Security Council and that, even if the ﬁve perma-
nent members were unanimous, their action would
not be effective unless it was concurred in by at
least two of the so-called “small” powers. It also
required that all parties to a dispute shall partici-
pate in any discussions relative to a dispute.
Mr. Molotov further stated that, if it is legiti-
mate for the four of us to meet together and con-
fer, it is even more legitimate for ﬁve powers
to do so.
This argument, it seems, bases the legitimacy of
this meeting on a false foundation. We four are
not meeting here because other nations have given
us or because we have usurped a right to deal
generally with world problems. We four are here
to deal with the roblem of German and the prob-
lem of Austria cause we are the four occupying
powers. There are no other occupying powers.
Therefore, the liberation of Austria and the uni-
ﬁcation of Germany depend upon us and upon us
alone. We are the proper and indispensable
parties. There can be no end to the occupation
unless we four end it.
Had the matter at issue been the liberation of
Korea from foreign troops, then Communist
China would be a proper party because it is, even
thou h wron full in occupation of a large part
of orea. he nited States indeed actively
seeks a Korean political conference in which Com-
munist China would be a party. Also, of course,
the Republic of Korea would have to be a party
because its overnment, established by virtue of
internationa ly supervised free elections, speaks
for all the Korean people except those in the north
who are not allowed to participate in such
elections.
Futility of Five-Power Meeting
For the foregoing reasons, and for the reasons
alluded to in my opening statement, the United
States rejects the conce tion of a ﬁve-power meet-
ing to end internationa tensions.
As far as Asia is concerned, Korea and Indo-
china constitute the principal sources of tension
in the Far East. Nothing that has happened up
to date enables us to say that Communist China
is willing to collaborate in efforts to bring about
a solution on an acceptable basis of the Korean or
Indochina questions, or for that matter of any
other Asian problem.
The means for settling the Korean political
question with the participation of the ﬁve govern-
ments mentioned 1n the Soviet proposal is pro-
vided in the form of a political conference rec-
ommended by the Korean Armistice Agreement.
It is useless to s eak of another Asian confer-
ence to deal with orea so lon as the so—called
Chinese People’s Republic wit Soviet su ort
employs all possible means to revent the ho ing
of the olitical conference which was agreed to
by the orean Armistice terms, and indeed ro—
posed by the Chinese Communists themse ves.
There already exist appropriate forums for the
discussion of other matters which have been al-
luded to in the course of the statements made by
the Soviet Forei Minister.
If the Soviet nion ﬁnds it undesirable to avail
of existing United Nations and conference pro-
cedures, there remain diplomatic channels through
which any and all problems can be discussed.
The United States, and, I have no doubt, also the
United Kingdom and France, are prepared to
discuss by means of normal diplomatic channels
all points which the Soviet Government wishes
to explore.
Mechanisms for Reducing Tensions
We have no desire that tensions should persist
merely because there is no mechanism for alla -
ing them. We believe that such mechanisms 0
exist, either through the United Nations or
through conferences on speciﬁc matters which will
bring together the parties in interest, or through
di lomatic channels.
Ve are not aware of any concrete problem the
solution of which would be facilitated by estab-
