volume of immigration added to the problems
caused by the normal backlogs of consumption
and investment demand resulting from the war.
Consequently, until early 1952 the process of
development was accompanied by continuous in-
ﬂationar pressure which was at its greatest in
1950 an 1951; and production in the basic eco-
nomic activities such as agriculture, coal mining,
and power was not suﬁicient to meet rapidly
growmg demands.
In 1951 strong anti-inﬂationary action was taken
by both the Commonwealth Bank and the Treas-
ury. The bud t was designed to (produce a large
surplus; tax atﬁiiistments were ma e to discourage
consumption and investment; and more restric-
tive monetary and credit policies were adopted.
At the same time the rate of immigration de-
clined, and a general im rovement in the supply
position in the rest of t e world led to a large
increase in Australia’s imports and a substantial
balance-of-payments deﬁcit. These forces com-
bined to brin about a she reduction in the
liquidity of t e economy, an the inﬂation was
brought to a halt. Durin 1952 Australia ex-
perienced a mild recession wﬁile the heavy imports
of the previous few months were absorbed. By
early 1953 the small amount of unemplo cat
which had made its appearance in 1952 was imin-
ishing and economic expansion was resumed,
thou h without the steady inﬂationary pressure
whic had accompanied the earlier period. In
future, therefore, Australian development should
be able to proceed without the distorting effects
of excessive demand.
T he effects of the high level of investment in
Australia since the war are now beginning to be
apparent. The lags of production in basic indus-
tries are now lar ely overcome. In particular
there has recently 11 an increase in agricultural
production, which is of fundamental importance
to an economy relying large] on earnings from
agricultural ex orts to pure ase the im orts it
needs. Until t e 1952—53 season the failure of
agricultural production to expand was a matter of
concern in Australia. Since 1939, population had
been increasin at about twice the rate of increase
of a icultura production so that in 1951—52,
whic i was admittedly an unfavorable season,
agricultural production was only 4 percent higher
than prewar, whereas population was up 24 per-
cent. The 1952-53 season showeda eatimprove-
ment, total agricultural production being 18
percent above prewar. The most striking develop-
ment was a 20 percent increase in the wool clip
to 1,280 million pounds, an alltime record. The
production of wheat, meat, and sugar also in-
creased substantially. Altogethr exports of agri-
cultural produce increased to £A740 million from
£A560 million the previous season. The excellent
results of the 1952—53 season are only partly due
to favorable weather; they also reﬂect the greater
use by farmers of equipment and materials.
Previously farm output had suffered because of
shortages of such things as tractors, mechanical
harvesters, fertilizers, wire nettin , and fencing.
Increases in both imports and loca production of‘
these essentials in recent years did much to relieve
this position and pave the way for growing agri-
cultural production in the future.
The improvement in the Australian economy-
has also been apparent in industry, where the in-
crease in production since 1946-47 has been sub-
stantial, for example: 60 percent in electricity. 30»
percent in coal, and 45 percent in pig iron. ew
capacity under construction is expected to result in.
a substantially increased output of ﬂat rolled-steel
products and reﬁned petroleum in the next year-
or two.
However, to maintain in the future the rate of
progress which has been achieved in the last few
years, Australia still needs imported capital equip-
ment in addition to that which can be purchased
from her own resources. The bank loan is de-
signed to ﬁll this need.
