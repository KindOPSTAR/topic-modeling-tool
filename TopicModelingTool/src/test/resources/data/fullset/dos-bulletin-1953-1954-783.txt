New Trend In (iaptlve Countrles
In the 14 months that have passed since Stalin’s
death, important thin s have hap ened in the
captive countries as we 1 as in the oviet Union.
The inevitable struggle for power has reduced
reshuﬂlings of arty and government 0 ces and
ofﬁceholders. eria is dead, and what thoughts
run through his followers’ heads?
In the puppet regimes events followed the Mos-
cow pattern and serve as a further reminder of
the subservience of those regimes t0 the Kremlin.
More signiﬁcant has been the announcement in
each of the captive countries of a “new economic
course.” The terms and conditions of this new
course vary from country to country, but there
are certain features common to the whole of Soviet-
dominated Eastern Europe. Thus, each regime
has confessed to the world it has followed im-
practical, ineﬁicient, and contraproductive eco-
nomic policies. These confessions of failure have
been invariabl accompanied by protestations of
concern for t e welfare of the people and b
promises of thoroughgoin reforms. It is worth
considering what has in uced these doctrinaire
Communists to shift their tactics so suddenly and
to alter, temporarily at least, long-cherished Com-
munist economic precepts—man of which had
been reexamined and approved y Stalin as re-
cently as October 1952. Clearly 1t was no new-
found concern for the misery of its subject peoples
that caused the Kremlin to chan e its economic
tune. The answer is to be found 1n the stubborn
and long-continued resistance of the people.
The world was dramatically reminded of the
vitality of this opposition spirit last June 17, when
in East Berlin and the Soviet Zone of Germany
unarmed workers rioted in deﬁance of the Com-
munist puppets who ruled them, backed by Soviet
troops and tanks. But there are other forms of
resistance which are not so spectacular but which
nonetheless impose severe strains on the Soviet
control mechanisms. These are such things as cir-
culating uncensored news heard from Western
radio stations, absenteeism and tardiness on the
job, slowdowns in production, the diversion of
food and other products from the prescribed chan-
nels of controlled trade. As individual acts these
things may seem small, but when practiced on a
nationwide scale they are enormously effective—
so eﬂ'ective that the Communists were compelled
to embark on their “new economic course” in order
to eliminate some of the causes of disaﬂ'ection and
to remove some of the obstacles to increased pro-
duction. Surely there could be no clearer evi-
dence of popular resistance. Now, instead of re-
lying only on such devices as terror, party agita-
tion, “socialist emulation,” “stakhanovite accom-
plishment,” and the like, the Communist rulers
strive to lure their subjects into producing more
by holding out promises of a greater supply of
foodstuffs and consumer goods in the future.
If the Communists really are interested in im-
proving the standard of living of the subjugated
peoples, the normal channels of trade and com-
merce are 0 en to them to purchase in the West
the foodstugs and other consumer goods which
they lnow profess to want to make available to the
co es.
p nfortunately for Communist calculations, the
people of these countries long ago learned to be
ske tical of Communist promises. It is precisely
in ostering this attitude that we can be of assist-
ance to these people. Certainly we would not
want to deny to them any improvement in their lot.
We sincerely hope the Communist leaders will
perform under their promises. You can be sure
that we will not let them forget these promises,
and if they prove to be a cynical effort to relieve
the pressures to which they now feel themselves
exposed, we will, in support of their victims, hold
them to account.
At the same time, we can point out the a parent
reasons why the Communists have ma e these
promises in the ﬁrst place and why they may not be
able to, or do not intend to, implement them for
the beneﬁt of the pee le rather than for the ur-
pose of augmentin 'oviet ower. We can elp
the people pierce t e veil 0 Communist trickery
and at the same time show our sympath and
understanding of the problems facing the or inary
people of these countries. By seizing every oppor-
tunity to show our sympathy and understanding,
we can hel to maintain against a relentless
tyranny their faith in their national traditions,
their spirit of resistance, and their determination
to be free men and free nations once more.
In all that we do the welfare of the peoples
themselves must continue to be the basis of our
policies and actions.
We must above all continue to give tangible
assurance to these people that we consider their
plight a persisting challenge to all of us. We must
make it clear that we regard the improvement of
their lot as a moral obligation resting on all
nations who still enjoy a free and sovereign exist-
ence. Never must they be allowed to feel that we
hold them guilty of the crimes committed by
masters they did not choose. We must prove to
them, by word and deed, that the bonds of kinship
which tie them to the history and culture of the
\Vest can never be dissolved by arbitrary ﬁat.
When the hour of freede will strike, nobody can
tell. We do not expect it to happen tonight or
tomorrow morning. Although everything that
we and they can do to accelerate the process of
their emancipation must and will be done, the road
which they will have to travel may yet be long
and arduous.
