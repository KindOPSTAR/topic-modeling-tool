only expressed his “great pleasure at having the
opportunity of receiving so distinguished a rep-
resentative of a country with which the United
States enjoys especially close relations,” but ex-
pressed “his concern over some evidence that there
ad lately occurred a deterioration in relations be-
tween the Arab nations and the United States.”
He added that “it would be his ﬁrm purpose to
seek to restore the spirit of conﬁdence and trust
which had previousl characterized these relations
and he hoped that t e Arab leaders would be in-
spired b the same purpose.” President Eisen-
hower alliided to “the many strong educational and
cultural ties” between the Arab world and the
United States and was conﬁdent that this was “a
foundation of good will on which to build during
the coming years to mutual advantage.” The
President also stressed his personal interest “in the
welfare and progress of Saudi Arabia and the
other States in the Near East.”
Vlelt of Secretary Dulles
President Eisenhower was, indeed, “keenly
aware of the im ortance of the Near East and
South Asia.” n March 9, Secretary Dulles
announced that the President had asked him to
go personally to the Near East and South Asia “to
show our friendship for the Governments and peo-
ples of these areas,” and to obtain ﬁrsthand im-
pressions of their problems. It was the ﬁrst visit
ever paid to the area b a Secretary of State.
Accompanied by Mutual urity Director Harold
E. Stassen, Assistant Secretary of State Henry
A. Byroade, and others, SecretarieDulles visited
Egy t, Israel, Jordan, Syria, banon, Iraq,
Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, India, Turkey, Greece,
and Libya between May 9 and May 29.6
Mr. Dulles reported on his journey to the na-
tion on June 1 ’ and declared it “high time that
the United States Government paid more atten-
tion to the Near East and South Asia,” indicatin
that the situation in that area of the world called
for “urgent concern.” The Secretary had arrived
at a number of conclusions. He noted, in the ﬁrst
instance, that most of the peoples of this area
were “deeply concerned about political independ-
ence for themselves and others.” They were sus-
picious not only of the “colonial powers” but also
of the United States because, it was thought, mem-
bership of the United States in NATO required
it “to preserve or restore the old colonial interests
of our allies.” Mr. Dulles was convinced that
American policy had become “unnecessarily am-
biguous” in this matter, and he stressed that the
“'estern Powers could “gain, rather than lose,
from an orderly development of self-govern-
ment.”
Secondly, Mr. Dulles noted the popular demand
for better standards of livin a demand which
could no longer be i ored. e believed that the
United States coul useful] help in ﬁnding a
solution of this problem “ y contributing ad-
vanced technical knowledge about transport, com-
munication, fertilization, and use of water for
irri ation” under the Mutual Security Pro ram.
hirdly, Mr. Dulles believed “that the nited
States should seek to allay the deep resentment
against it that has resulted from the creation of
Israel.” The Arab oples, he said, were “afraid
that the United States will back the new State of
Israel in aggressive expansion”; they were “more
fearful of Zionism than of communism.” Israel,
on the other hand, was fearful lest ultimately the ‘
grabs might try to push it into the Mediterranean
ea.
In this connection, the Secretary made it clear
that the United States still stood by the Tripartite
Declaration of May 25, 1950, as to violations of
frontiers or armistice lines. He also said that the
leaders in Israel themselves “a reed with us that
United States licies should impartial so as
to win not 0 y the respect and regard of the
Israeli but also of the Arab peo les,” and that the
United States would seek suc policies. There
was need for peace in the Middle East, achieve-
ment of which would uire concessions on the
art of both Israel and tie Arab States, and the
ecreta declared that the United States would
not “hesitate by every appropriate means to use its
inﬂuence to promote a step-by-step reduction of
tension in the area and the conclusion of ultimate
peace.” On the other hand, he was now convinced
that the establishment of a Middle East Defense
Organization was a matter for the future, not an
immediate possibility.
Beelc Problems In the United Nations
As had been the case in previous years, the new
Secretary-General of the United Nations, Dag
Hammarskjold, in his annual report on the work
of the United Nations, made general reference to
problems arising from areas like the Near East,
South Asia, and Africa. Among other things,
for example, he declared: ‘
'Ibid., Mar. 23. 1953, p. 431; Apr. 21'. 1953. p. 605;
May 18. 1953, p. 707.
' "ML, June 15, 1953, p. 831.
The efforts of the governments to control and moderate
those conﬂicts that constitute an immediate danger to
world peace—and above all the “East-West" conﬂict—-
must command ﬁrst attention in day-to-day decisions.
However, side by side with those conﬂicts, or underly-
ing them, two fundamental trends in human society are
apparent which must determine the long-term direction
of our efforts. One of the trends is directed towards
wider social justice and equality for individuals. The
other is directed towards equality and justice between
nations, politically but also in the economic and social
sense.
