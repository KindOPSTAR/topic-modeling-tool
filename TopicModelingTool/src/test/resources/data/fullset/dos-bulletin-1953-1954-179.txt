and the military service of individual Germans
would be closely restricted.
Such a European army could go into action on]
in response to great and pressmg needs of sel -
defense. It could not be used without the con-
currence of countries which themselves have had
bitter experience with German militarism and
which could never be a party to its revival.
The lVest German Federal Republic, represent-
ing over two-thirds of the German people, has
eagerly turned toward the buildin of a European
communiati7 in which its own nationalism will be
submerg .
It is indeed a historic moment when the Ger-
mans have come to realize the danger to them-
selves and to all Europe if their energies are con-
ﬁned to nationalistic channels and if their future
success must be measured only in terms of national
grandeur. The German desire to bury the ex-
cesses of German nationalism is a desire that can-
not be repulsed without grave hazards for the
future.
Surely this is a matter which the four of us
ought to be able to consider together with the feel-
ing that we are bound together by the same inter-
ests. The United States credits the Soviet Union
with a sincere desire to achieve security in Eu-
rope. Certainly that is our own desire. It would
be a tragedy if a division between us on this
matter created the very insecurity which we all
would banish.
My plea is therefore that we explore this matter,
not in any sense as representing opposing sides,
but as a group of countries which, with the Ger-
mans, seek a single goal—the transformin of
_Europe from a cockpit of war to a home of a id-
ing peace.
METHOD OF REUNIFICATION
Memorandum submitted on January 2.9 by Mr.
Eden
German reuniﬁcation and the conclusion of a freely
negotiated peace treaty with a United Germany should
be achieved in the following stages:
I. Free elections throughout Germany.
II. The convocation of a national assembly resulting
from those elections.
III. The drafting of a constitution and the preparation
of peace treaty negotiations.
IV. The adoption of the constitution and the formation
of an all-German government responsible for the negotia-
tion of the peace treaty.
V. The signature and entry into force of the peace
treaty.
I. Free Elections Throughout Germany
Free and secret elections should be held throughout
Germany including Berlin at the earliest possible date.
These elections must be held in conditions of genuine free-
dom. Safeguards must be agreed to assure this freedom
before. durin;r and after the elections. The elections
must also be supervised in such a manner as to make
sure that these safeguards are observed and that the elec-
tions are properly conducted.
MARATIOI POI ILIC‘I’IONS
a. The electoral law. The electoral law should be pre-
pared by the four occupying powers. taking into consid-
eration the electoral laws already drafted for this pur-
pose by the Federal Bundestag and the Soviet zone Volks-
kannner. When approved, it should be promulgated
throughout Germany by the four powers. Elections
should take place as soon as possible thereafter.
b. Guaranties for free elections. The draft electoral
law must contain provisions which will guarantee the gen-
uine freedom of the elections. These include, amongst
others: Freedom of movement throughout Germany.
Freedom of presentation of candidates. Immunity of
candidates. Freedom from arbitrary arrest or victimisa-
tion. Freedom of association and political meetings.
Freedom of expression for all. Freedom of the press,
radio and television and free circulation of newspapers,
periodicals, etc. Secrecy of the vote. Security of polling
stations and ballot boxes.
0. Supervision of the elections. Supervision should be
carried out by a supervisory commission throughout the
whole of Germany. There should be a central body with
subordinate bodies at Land and local levels. All votes
should be counted and veriﬁed at local headquarters in
the presence of the supervisory commission.
0'. Composition of the supervisory commission: The
commission should be composed of representatives of the
four powers with or without participation of neutrals.
H. Organisation of the commission: The commission
should work on a committee basis. Its decisions should
be taken by a majority vote.
iii. Functions and powers of the commission: The prin-
cipal task of the commission will be to insure that the
elections take place in genuine freedom and in strict
conformity with the provisions of the electoral law.
MITIIOD FOR COMPLETING Till AIOVI PREPARATIONS
The foreign ministers must in the ﬁrst place agree on
the principles contained in this plan. They will then
give instructions accordingly to a working group con-
sisting of the High Commissioners in Germany of the
four powers or their representatives which will work out
the necessary details and submit a report.
This report should include in particular:
1. A draft of the all-German electoral law.
2. Detailed recommendations regarding the supervision
of the elections.
The working group should begin work not later than
two weeks after the conclusion of the Berlin conference.
It should submit its report to the four governments not
later than one month after beginning its work.
II. The National Assembly
All-German elections will establish an all-German na-
tional assembly. The first task of this assembly will be
the preparation of a constitution.
During the period between the end of the elections and
full assumption of control by the ail-German government
it will be desirable for part of the supervisory machinery
to remain in operation in order to prevent action after
the elections which would impair conditions of genuine
freedom under which they will have been held. Recom-
mendations on this subject should be included in the re-
port of the working group.
III. Drafting of the Constitution and Establishment
of a Provisional All-German Authority
The national assembly will begin drafting a constitution
as soon as possible after its first meeting. Meanwhile, it
