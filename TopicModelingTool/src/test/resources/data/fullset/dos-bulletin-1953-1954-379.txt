Dean MR. DEAN! Regarding your letter of Feb-
ruary 26, 1954, addressed to Secretary Dulles, all
of us are eatly disappointed that the Korean
Political onference has been so long postponed
that it has made it impossible for you to serve as
the President and the Secretary had originally
planned. It will, however, be very useful and
ighly a preciated if, as you indicate, on will con-
tinue tobe available on a consultant asis to help
us here in Washington in connection with the
Korean Political Conference, which is presently
ex ted to convene on April 26 at Geneva.

We have come here today to take part in a
notable occasion. Two destroyers of the United
States Reserve Fleet are to be turned over on loan
to the Republic of China under an authorization
by the United States Congress. Such an event is

this world. In participating in the ceremonies

However, in looking forward to these observ-

image of the Chief of State of the Republic of
China—a picture of him not only as the austere,
uniformed leader depicted in the lithographs that
have had a place of honor on the walls of so many
Chinese homes and shops, but as the warm and

dor for the President in the preliminar work at
Panmunjom constitutes a splendid c apter in
American diplomatic annals. You dealt with the
Communists there in a way which was vi orous
and jealous of the dignity and honor of the nited
States.
Your contacts with President Syngman Rhee of
the Republic of Korea, the Neutral Commission,
and with General Thimayya, have materially con-
tributed in the general opinion to the prompt
release of the prisoners of war on J anuar 22.
You have gained I am sure, the conﬁ ence of
the nations which fought on the United Nations
side, as re resented by the grou of seventeen who
have met ere and in New Yor , and with whom
you have been fre uently associated.

so many memorable hours in the past. Then too,
the Chinese Ambassador who is here with me,
\Vellington Koo, is an old friend. It is impossible
for me to act as if I were addressing strangers.
\Vhat is taking place here is, as it were, within the
family. You Wlll look to me in vain, therefore, for
those high-pitched, majestic cries that mi ht be
expected to resound when an eagle and a ragon

more than you would expect to hear between 015
friends—friends who, as a matter of fact, need to
say very little to each other because so much is
understood between them.
The spirit of this occasion is a familiar one to us.
The Chlnese and Americans are used to giving
each other things. It began many years ago. One
of our writers in New England, speaking of those
days, has told us of the satisfaction with which he
reﬂected that ice had been taken from his little
pond, by clipper ship, to cool the drink of 8. Chi-
nese philosopher. Philosophy and the artistic
masterpieces of a great culture have been among
