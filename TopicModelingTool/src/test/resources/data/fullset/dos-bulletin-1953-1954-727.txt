platitude. Living as we do side by side on the
same continent, our resemblances are many. We
have, too, similar views on fundamental things.
Among our common characteristics, one_ of the
greatest, I believe, is our dislike of regimenta-
tion—our respect for the differences which lend
color to everyday existence. We believe that each
man should lead his own life; that each group of
men should reserve its own customs. It is not
surprising, t erefore, that for all that we have in
common, you and we should each preserve certain
habits and traditions which we cherish because
they belong to us. We know it is not your wish to
have on your borders a mere replica of your own
country, but rather a self-respecting community
faithful to its own ways. We are thus better neigh-
bors, because self-respect is the key to respect for
others. On our side of the border you will ﬁnd a
country in which parliamentary government has
been, we believe, successfully married to a federal
system; a country whose eople cherish two
languages and two cultures-— nglish and French;
a land which has inherited from its mother coun-
tries in the Old lVorld many forms and customs
which have been happily ﬁtted into life in the
New. These ways of ours you respect because they
are ours, just as we res ect your ways because they
are yours. Thus, in t e words of the Treaty of
Amity, Commerce, and Navigation, which laid
the foundation of our present concord as lon ago
as 1794, we “ romote a disposition favorab e to
friendship an good neighborhood.”
In Canada we are indeed fortunate in our neigh-
borhood. We haveawarmhearted neighbor. This
your people have shown us over the years. There
are countless bodies in this country in which,
through your invitations, Canadians share mem-
bership with their American friends. We are
not unmindful of what we owe to your great uni-
versities and foundations. Let me say, too, that
we are ever conscious of the warmth of the hos-
pitality we receive when we are your guests.
U.S. Strength Dedicated to Freedom
We have a powerful nei hbor. Your massive
strength, economic and mi itary, excites a sense
of wonder at its magnitude. The dedication of
this power to the cause of freedom evokes the
atitude of all who love freedom everywhere.
our Canadian neighbors know that when on
assumed the ave responsibilities ou bear t ay,
it was not 0 ylour choosing. An for what you
have done, we onor you.
We have a friendly neighbor. There is no need
to enlarge on the traditions of neighborl good
sense which for so long have marked our re ations.
We can only hope that the may be reﬂected else-
where in this troubled wor d.
We are happy to think that we know on well.
Countless Canadians have personal frien s on this
side of the border. Many of us have relatives
here. It is, of course, natural that a small com-
munity should know more of a larger neighbor
than that neighbor knows of it. We are getting
to know each other better as the years pass. We
welcome your visits to us. Often your ob'ective
may be the river or the forest, and we are app
to oifer you a playground. But perhaps you Wlﬁ
let me say that we would not have our visitors
show too strong a preference for those parts of
Canada which are not yet inhabited by Canadians.
We should like you to know our peo le—what
they do and how they do it. I wou d not, of
course, suggest that you are unaware of what is
goin on in Canada in the ﬁeld of engineering
and industry for example. Much of our develo -
ment in these spheres, I need not say, is a resu t
of your conﬁdence in our future. Nowhere has
our recent growth met with warmer acclaim than
in this country. It is true that quite extraordi-
nary things have happened of late in Canada, but
we prefer sober adjectives with which to describe
them. Our ex ansion has been rapid, but it is
steady and it is built on sound realities. It is
based on the character of our people and on the
quality of our national life. It is based on a.
hardihood and spirit of adventure as remarkable
as that shown by our ﬁrst explorers; on the dis-
ciplined intellect of our men of science seeking
out new horizons of knowledge and usefulness;
on the devotion of our le islators working to ful-
ﬁll the conscious vision 0% the fathers of our Con-
federation who almost 100 years ago came to-
gether to found a new nation. We believe that
the Canada of today is not unworthy of inspec-
tion. I invite you to come and see us.
Working Together In the lnternatlonel Communlty
I have talked about ourselves as your neighbors.
I have said little about ourselves as your partners.
You and we work together in the international
community. Along with kinsmen and friends
across the seas, we are allies in defense of the
things we value. And, if I may say so, I think
that we in Canada, like you, have given proof that
those values must be actively and zealously de-
fended. Thus, in the Far North we are working
with you to strengthen the defenses of this con-
tinent on our territory and on yours. In Korea
there has been, from an early stage, a brigade
group of Canadian troops. They are now stand-
ing guard against the possibility of renewed at-
tack. Twelve squadrons of the Royal Canadian
Air Force and a further Canadian brigade group
are stationed in Europe. Such formations, I need
hardly say, should naturally be related in our
minds to the size of the population which provides
them.
We are also supplying our European friends
with mutual aid on a considerable scale. Canada,
too, is giving-help under the Colombo plan to the
countries of southern Asia. We believe, as you
do, that tth‘oblems of our time cannot be solved
