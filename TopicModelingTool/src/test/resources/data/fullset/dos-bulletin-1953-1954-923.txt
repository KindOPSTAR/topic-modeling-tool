Security in the Pacific
Address by Secretary Dulles 1
It seems appropriate here to speak of the Paciﬁc
Ocean. That is responsive to my deep interest
derived both from 1nheritance and experience.
My andfather, as Secretary of State, negotiated
the ﬁrl‘st Hawaiian Annexation Treaty, and then
he negotiated peace between China and Japan.
In the last 4 years, I have dealt with the Paciﬁc
area in connection with the Japanese peace treaty
and the security treaties with Australia, New
Zealand the Philippines, and Japan, and in rela-
tion to korea. These missions have involved my
crossing the Paciﬁc 12 times.
Looking Westward
For approximately 100 years, between 1830 and
1930, the United States had generally friendly
relations with the nationson the other side of this
vast ocean, and we faced no threat from that
direction.
Since 1930 there has been a change for the worse.
The economic de ression of 1929-30 cut Japan’s
forei trade in alf. It gave the Japanese ex-
tremists a chance to press their program for ex-
tending the Japanese Em ire. In 1931, Japanese
aggression began in Manc uria.
Our Government saw the serious implications
of that move. Secretary of State Stimson pro-
posed to other countries that there should be united
action to restrain Japanese aggression. The an-
swer, in Secretary Stimson’s own words, was “a
plain rebuﬁ'.” Matters went from bad to worse
until ﬁnally there came Pearl Harbor and the
Japanese sweep through Southeast Asia and the
Western Paciﬁc.
It took 4 years of terrible war to reverse that
situation. Now, happily, the island positions in
the Paciﬁc, for the most part, are no longer in
hostile hands. Japan is a friendly power. How-
ever, on the mainland the situation is different.
‘ Made before the Los Angeles World Affairs Council at
Los Angeles, Calif., on June 11 (press release 318).
When the Japanese surrender occurred, the
Russian Red armies were allowed to penetrate
deeply into China and Korea to accept the sur-
render of Japanese forces. Also, the Soviet Gov-
ernment took over the Manchurian railroads and
Port Arthur and the J a anese northern islands,
as had been agreed at Yalta. But, in violation of‘
its express agreement, the Soviet gave vast J ap-
anese war supplies to the Chinese Communist
forces, so that, by the end of 1949, they had
gained control of substantially all of the China
mainland.
In June 1950 the Communists from North Korea
opened their military aggression, and in Novem-
ber 1950 the Chinese Communist regime launched
its massive attack against the forces of the United
Nations engaged in repelling the Korean aggres-
sion.
Also, the Chinese Communist regime has stead-
ily increased material and technical aid to the
Communist forces ﬁghting in Indochina. Now, at
Geneva, the Chinese Communist delegation at-
tacks the United States with venomous words and
boldl charges the United Nations itself with being
a too of aggression.
Today, the vast Paciﬁc is a friendl ocean only
because the West Paciﬁc islands an two penin-
sular positions are in friendly hands. Thus, the
Unite States itself holds Okinawa, Guam, and
other islands. Also we have security or defense
arrangements covering the Philippines, Australia,
New Zealand, Korea, Formosa, and Japan. We
are giving su plies to the French Union forces in
Indochina. ut close behind this island and pen-
insular screen lies a mainland with many hundreds
of millions of people under a despotic rule that
is fanatically hosti e to us and demonstrably ag-
gressive and treacherous.
Japan
One problem which must particularly concern
us Is the economy of Japan, a chain of rocky
islands whose area is about that of California.
