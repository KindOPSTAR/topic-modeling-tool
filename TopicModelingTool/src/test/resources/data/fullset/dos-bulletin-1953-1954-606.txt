regardin human rights. One of these, entitled
“Strengt enin of the System for the Protection
of Human Rig ts,” appeared to the U.S. delega-
tion to give a propriate attention to the point of
view that the gest methods for promoting respect
for human rights are often found in education
and example rather than through legal compul-
sion. In this resolution, various steps were
proposed which governments might take to en-
courage observance of, and wider dissemination
of information on, basic rights and duties of man.
In the Same resolution, the Pan American Union
was requested to obtain periodically from the gov-
ernments information relating to the rogress
made in promoting human rights, to e ect ex-
change of pertinent legislation among the Ameri-
can States, and to undertake studies in comparative
law concerning such legislation, iving preference
to those rights centering aroun freedom of ex-
ression. A separate resolution, introduced by
ruguay, requesting the Council of the Oas to
study the possibilit of creating an Inter-Ameri-
can Court for the Protection of Human Rights,
was opposed by the United States, on the grounds
that such a court is premature and does not con-
stitute an effective instrument for advancing the
objective of greater respect for human rights.
Cultural Matters
Action of the Tenth Conference in the cultural
ﬁeld centered primaril on three important as-
pects: revision of the onvention for the Promo-
tion of Inter-American Cultural Relations, the
need for greater efforts to promote general educa-
tion, especiall the eradication of illiteracy, and
guidance to t e organs of the Oas dealing with
cultural matters in the development and execution
of their programs.
Revision of the Convention for the Promotion
of Cultural Relations marked a signiﬁcant step
in the ﬁeld of cultural relations and educational
exchange. This convention, which is concerned
with the exchan e of students and professors, was
sponsored by t e United States at the Buenos
Aires conference in 1936. Ex erience with its
application since that time has emonstrated that
many of its detailed provisions for the selection
and sup ort of exchangees are excessively rigid
and cum rsome. Revision of the convention was
directed therefore, at introducin greater ﬂexibil-
it in the awarding of fellowships and grants.
T us, for example, allowance is made for the ar-
ties to carry out exchan e programs through direct
bilateral agreements. he rocedures for select-
ing exchangees are simpliﬁe and the ﬁnancial re-
sponsibilities of the participating governments
are speciﬁed more recisely and realistically. A
new provision was a so introduced into the conven-
tion entrusting the Pan American Union with the
responsibility for compiling and circulating an-
nually to the states members of the Gas reports on
the nature and extent of the articipation of each
in exchange rograms. All t e governments rep-
resented at aracas signed the revised convention.
In the ﬁeld of education the Conference reco -
nized that the eradication of illiteracy is of t e
utmost importance and requested that s ecial at-
tention be given to this matter in the cu tural ac-
tivities for which the Council of the Oas is directly
responsible as well as in the Oas Technical Coop-
eration Pro am. The overnments were likewise
urged to intensify t eir national campaigns
a ainst illiteracy, endeavoring to coordinate them
With the activities of the Oas. In other resolutions
bearing on education the Tenth Conference rec-
ommended to the governments the establishment
of specialized educational centers for rural areas,
requested the Committee for Cultural Action to
undertake studies on vocational education in the
American States and on the aluivalence of aca-
demic degrees, commended the Pan American
Union for the work it has done in organizing semi-
nars in education and urged the governments to
lend their support to development of demonstra-
tion libraries. The Conference also endorsed the
idea that there should be held a meeting of Minis-
ters and Directors of Education simultaneously
with the next meeting of the Cultural Council and
requested the Cultural Council to consider the de-
sirability of holding periodic meetings of rectors,
deans, and professors. Various other resolutions
includin a possible convention on exchange of
publications, participation in the 1946 Inter-
American C0 yright Convention, and sup rt of
the work of t e Pan American Union in literary
publications, the United States was not able to
support for a variety of reasons.
A signiﬁcant action of the Tenth Conference
was to trace the uide lines which the overn-
ments, the Counci? of the Oas and the ultural
Council should follow in developing and ca ing
out inter-American cultural programs. The“ ec-
laration on Cultural Cooperation” sets forth the
areas in the educational, scientiﬁc, and cultural
ﬁelds in which they are ur to intensify their
efforts. In a resolution entitled “Inter-American
Cultural Organizations” the Conference recom-
mended to the governments a greater utilization
of the cultural organs of the Or nization of
American States, to the Council ofﬂthe Oas an
increased effort to improve the functioning and
coordination of its cultural organs, and to the
Inter-American Cultural Council a series of
points, emphasizing coordination and the estab-
ishment of riorities, which it should bear in
mind in deve oping its program.
