V‘OT‘I We feel a close tie with the people of
.nia thro h a common devotion to freedom
and national independence. We sympathize
deeply with them in their present distress.
The United States continues to recognize the
independence of Lithuania because we know that
the present situation in the Baltic States was
brought about by direct Soviet aggression and has
never been conﬁrmed by the free expression of the
will of the peoples concerned. In refusing to rec-
ognize the forced incorporation of the Baltic
States, the United States remains faithful to the
princi les to which our Nation has been dedicated
since t e promul ation of our own Declaration of
Independence. f the Soviet Union were to abide
b the principles which it professes, no doubt the
altic peoples would be restored to freedom.
We in the United States know that eve Lith-
uanian celebrates the 36th anniversary of t e Dec-
laration of Lithuanian Independence in his own
innermost thoughts and prays for the day when he
can again demonstrate his love of count as a free
citizen of an independent Lithuania. 1 the ex-

Problems of Foreign Economlc Pollcy
by Samuel C. Waugh
Assistant Secretary for Economic Aﬂaz'ra ‘
During the past month of January, the ﬁrst an-
niversary of the present Administration, many
important messages were delivered by the Pres-
ident to the Congress, and in addition two sig-
niﬁcant publications were released.
The Economic Report of the President, pre-
pared by the Council of Economic Advisers, was
submitted to the Con s on January 28, 1954.“
A few days previous, larence B. Randall, Chair-
man of the Commission on F orei n Economic
Policy, resented his report to the resident and
to the ongres.‘
‘ Address made before the Trust Division of the Amer-
ican Bankers Association 35th annual mid-winter meet-
ing at New York, N. Y., on Feb. 8 (press release 55 dated
February 5).

us that this longing for freedom cannot forever
be denied. “'e know that the cause of national
independence and the right of all peoples to gov-
ernments of their own choosing, supported by the
free world, will prove stronger than a tyrannous
dictatorship.
Exports to Sovlet Bloc
Secretary of Commerce Sinclair Weeks an-
nounced on February 10 that it had been decided
as a matter of polio to deny commercial ex ort
license applications or the export for cash of .S.
Government-owned sur lus agricultural or vege-
table ﬁber products to lgussia or her satellites.
Secretary \Veeks pointed out, however, that this
ban does not preclude study of export license a -
glication for these nonstrategic products to e
oviet bloc if acquired by exporters in the 0 en
market and not from the Commodity Credit r-
poration surplus stocks.
A recent national poll reported that only 28
percent of the American peo le had ever heard
of the highly controversial l ricker amendment.
If that report is correct, I doubt if more than
a fraction of one percent will ever read the highly
si iﬁcant publications just released.
t me hasten to add that these two documents
have been scrutinized with eagle eyes by the re
resentativcs of every foreign government in Was -
ington, as evidenced by the stream of Ambassa-
dors and their economic advisers who have been
