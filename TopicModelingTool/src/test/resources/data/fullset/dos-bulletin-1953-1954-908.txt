JOHN SLEZAK (UNITED STATES)
UNDER SECRETARY OF THE ARMY
In this time of international conﬂict, it is heart-
ening and reassuring to witness two nations in the
western world living side by side in mutual respect
and friendship, and jointly dedicating their talents
to the enhancement of one of the most magniﬁcent
natural wonders with which our continent is en-
dowed. At the same time, consistent with the
reservation of natural splendor, Canada and the
nited States are preparing to derive, from this
same resource, power to expand our economies and
add to the comfort and well-being of our people.
It is plain good sense for us to cooperate in such
activities, which result only in mutual beneﬁt.
Yet how rare this kind of good sense is today!
Throughout the world, more lifegiving water is
being withheld by international disputes—with-
held from people who desperately need it—than
has been developed and put to use in all lands to-
gether. More than half of the world’s eople live
in the great arid belt that circles the glo e. These
people suffer hunger and overty, beside barren
acres, while the water which would bring good
living to all ﬂows by unused, because men on one
bank of the river cannot work together with the
equally needy men who live on the other bank.
Examples dot the globe. They exist in the Mid-
dle East, in the Far East, in Europe, in Africa,
and in Asia. They exist also in the Americas, both
North and South. Even within the United States,
water rivalries between states have held back
needed resource developments from entire genera-
tions of our citizens. Experience has shown that
there are very few causes of conﬂict between people
which are as stubborn, as complex, and as fraught
with emotional excitement, as disputes over water.
One might think that the very urgency with
which water developments are required in desert
regions would be an incentive to cooperation—for

that purpose, at least. Instead, we ﬁnd that it is
two of the most prosperous and least needy nations
on earth, Canada and the United States, which
have been most successful in ﬁnding ways of solv-
ing water disputes. And perhaps it is their ability
to cooperate and get thin done which has helped
to make these two nations so prosperous and
strong.
Canada and the United States set up the Inter-
national Joint Commission by treaty in 1909, to
handle problems arisin along the more than 5,000
miles of international boundary between our two
nations. Most of these problems have dealt with
the use of rivers shared by both countries. The
Niagara Falls Remedial Project is a signiﬁcant
example of the constructive work done under the
aegis of the Joint Commission. Through this
Commission, we have been able to reconcile our
interests in neighborly fashion, before difﬁculties
could become inﬂated into controversial issues and
inﬂamed into international quarrels.
The Commission has been an indispensable in-
strument in accomplishing the harmony that ex-
ists between the two most friendly nations on
earth.
But even this ex erienced organization, ﬁrmly
backed as it is by 0th its contributing nations,
cannot solve a river problem in a day. The point
is that it does solve these knotty problems—and
solve them well—by the democratic process, so
that people on both sides of the border know they
have obtained the best possible arrangement to
protect and advance all interests.
Vital developments are now being considered by
the International Joint Commission which affect
the Kootenai,2 the Milk River, the Belly, the Wa-
terton, and even the mighty Columbia itself—de-
velopments which are basic to the growth of the
entire Northwest—because people on each side of
the border want joint discussion and action on
questions which concern both nations.
The same kind of hard-working cooperative
effort has been applied with mutual beneﬁt in the
East, too—on the Great Lakes, and now on the
Niagara.
