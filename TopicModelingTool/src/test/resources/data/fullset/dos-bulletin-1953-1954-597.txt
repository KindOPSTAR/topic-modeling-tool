The Middle East In New Perspective
by Henry A. Byroade
Assistant Secretary for Near E astern, South Asian and African A fairs 1
To me the Middle East is one of the most fasci-
nating parts of the world, and I am convinced all
Americans would ﬁnd it so. It has been my good
fortune to visit each of its states at least twice, and
at each stop one wishes he could stay long enough
to ﬁnd out more—about not only the present-day
political and economic problems but the culture
and traditions, the hopes and aspirations of the
peo le themselves.
e area for which I am responsible abounds
in superlative contrasts. It ﬂaunts diversity of
costumes unrivaled an where else in the world
from the Evzones of reece, the veiled Tuaregs
of North Africa, the jaunty agal and kaﬁiyeh of
the desert Arab, and the multicolored jackets of
the Kurd to the Dinka, the Nuwwar and the
Shilluk of the Sudan who wears nothing at all.
The world’s richest men and the world’s poorest
have lived side by side in this area for ages. The
piercing minaret of the mosque, the church belfry,
the dome of the syna ogue attest to the evolu-
tion of the world’s loftiest religious faiths. And
where the peasant still plants his seed with the
sim lest of wooden tools, air lanes spread insec-
tici es to halt the march of tlie devouring locust.
Nowhere else in our universe do such extremes
stand in intimate juxtaposition.
One’s study of history—or one’s visit to the
area—need not be exhaustive or lengthy for the
conclusion that these people, beset as they are by
present day embroilments or economic poverty,
ave had a rich life—rich in the things one may
say make life worthwhile.
n fact the strength of our Western civilization
rests to a considerable extent on the foundations
of the ideas and sciences developed in the Middle
East. How could we have modern banks or ac-
counting had it not been for the Arabic numerals
which made rapid calculation possible? Ibn i
Haitham a thousand years ago discovered the
science of optics leading to the use of the micro-
scope. In ran, the millennial celebration of
Avicenna is taking place—the man who wrote one

of the greatest collections of medical lore known
before the eighteenth century. Similarly our
moral values, our ideas, and our symbols of cul-
tural intercourse to a great extent ori inated in
the Middle East. If by some ill win we were
suddenly to be deprived of the heritage given us
by the Middle East, we would be deprived of much
of the basis of the advanced state of our present
da civilization.
et this area—with its ast elements of great-
ness and its romise for the future—is today in-
volved in difﬁculties to such an extent that it can
truly be called a “trouble area” of the world. And
we as a country are more involved in the problems
of the area than ever before. Why is this so?
The answer is simple. We can no longer avoid
these problems even if we would choose to do so—
and we cannot choose to do so—in the interests of
our own welfare and securit .
The United States has
Middle Eastern scene suddenl and without ade-
quate national preparation. uring most of our
national rowth the peoples and problems of the
Middle Eglst have seemed remote from our daily
lives. Because of our expanding continental
boundaries, our eyes were naturally turned toward
our own West until 1900. Our concern was with
national developments and with Latin America.
The United States later involved in two world
conﬂicts, then focused most of its attention on
Euro e and the Far East. For lon the Middle
East new only American missionaries, archeolo-
gists, doctors, and educators.
In this period the United States had a humani-
tarian interest in developments in the Middle
East; it had a few trade interests, but other than
that our positive interests were few. Then, as
now, we had no interests of a colonial nature, no
alliances that gave us direct political responsi—
bilities.
Our position in the Middle East has changed
simply because our world position has changed
and because the world in which we live has
changed, changed to where there is in the East-
West situation for the ﬁrst time an ever present
