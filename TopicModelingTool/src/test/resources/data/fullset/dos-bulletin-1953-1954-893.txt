ernment with respect to the dangers of Communist
penetration in this hemisphere—and in Guatemala
1n articular—would remain precisely the same.
hope that the Or anization of American States
will be able to help t e people of Guatemala to rid
themselves of the malignant force which has seized
on them. As a member of this inter-American
organization, the United States inevitably takes a
s mpathetic interest in the courageous efforts of
uatemalans in all walks of life to ward off Com-
munist attem ts to destroy the freedom and inde-
pendence of uatemala. If they do not succeed,
the whole body of the Organization of American
States may be corrupted and we shall see in the
American continents the same forces which have
brought war and captivity and misery to so many
hundreds and millions in Euro e and Asia.
That is the evil desi n. I elieve that it will
be thwarted by peacefu , collective processes. If
so, the Organization of American States will
attain a new stature and exert a new inﬂuence.
The American Republics will have shown that
diversit can unite so that it produces, not con-
fusion, but enlightened action.
The United States Attitude
Let me in conclusion say a word or two about
the basic attitude of my own country, its govern-
ment and its people, toward these international
problems.
We do not assume that we have any mandate
to run the world. Nothing indeed would be
less in keeping with our traditions and our ideals.
Those who conceived this Nation and brought it
to life breathed into it a sense of mission. That
mission has to show others, by conduct and ex-
ample, that a free society could produce good
fruits. That has been and still is our basic foreign
olicy. Twice, during this generation, we have
eparted from our tradition by developing vast
mi itary power and using it abroad. Our sea, air
and land forces were spread over the surface 0
much of the globe. In both cases, as soon as the
common peril was ended, we brought our forces
home, and we largely dismantled our military
establishment. We wanted to concentrate upon
our own affairs.
We now see that, under modern conditions,
interdependence is not the exception but the rule.
We recognize that we have a measure of power
which carries with it certain responsibilities. We
are basically a religious eople, who believe in the
brotherhood of man and in the need to practice
the Golden Rule. That leads us to be willing
to help others to gain the conditions of security
which will help them to realize ideals which they
have in common with us. ‘
To say that, however, is far short of saying
that the United States has a responsibility
for all that takes lace throughout the world.
We do not accept the view that whenever there
is trouble anywhere, that is the fault of the United
States and we must quickly ﬁx it.
The United States does not believe that it. can
alone solve roblems elsewhere. The possibilities
of solution ie primarily with the peoples directly
concerned. It sometimes seems that others de-
liberately indulge themselves in irres onsible con-
duct on the theory that the Unite States will
prevent this having serious consequences. That is
dan erous business.
T e role of the United States is often miscon-
ceived. This is, perhaps, inevitable. It is not
readily understood that a nation should take so
enlightened a view of its own self-interest that it
does much for others without seeking for itself
any extension of its political power or national
domain. Our motives are sometimes openly sus-
pected. That makes it hard for us here at home
to pursue a steady course. However, I hope and
believe that we shall continue in our traditional
way. None need fear that we shall develop an un-
healthy lust for power. Also, I believe, we shall
persist in helping others to help themselves gain
peace and security and better standards of life in
larger freedom.
