Understanding Our Foreign Service
by John M. Cabot
Assistant Secretary for Inter-American Affairs1
We face a mortal peril today—perhaps a ater
one than any of those which we have face since
Revolutionary days. If we are to confront this
implacable challenge successfully we must. under-
stand the forces With which we are dealing. We
must have conﬁdence in each other. “'e must
realize that our security does not come from for-
mulae devised in an ivory tower—it comes from
the faith of our peo le in our institutions, our
elected and appoin ofﬁcials, our way of life.
It is of that that I would s k to you today.
Never underestimating t e power of women, I
believe it was the women of America who ar-
ticularly perceived that we could not go it a one
in the modern world; that in this shrunken world
we had better cooperate with friendly nations
lest we ourselves perish; that history was knock-
ing at our door and would not be denied. Other
sincerely patriotic Americans had different
views, and those views deserve attention and re-
spect. But there is one tendenc with which I
frank] have little patience. A too frequently
in pub ic arguments an effort is made to obscure
the issue b smearing the opponent. Today some
of those w o oppose our bipartisan foreign policy
are employing t iose tactics. Not wishing to argue
issues, they are attacking the instrument b which
it is carried out—without which, indeed, it prob-
ably could not be carried out. In exposing such
weaknesses as exist, they serve the country’s in-
terests; but in wilfully undermining our Foreign
Service, they emphatically do not.
Have you ever heard of an American di lomat
who has ridden up Broadway in a storm 0 ticker
tape? A good many Americans would probably
answer, I fear, that it would be better to ride
them out of town on a rail.
This talk might be entitled “Why Diplomats
Don’t Behave Like Human Beings.” I think you
will agree that that is an almost universal Ameri-
can gripe, and perhaps it is justiﬁed. On the
'Address made before the Massachusetts State Fed-
eration of Women's Clubs, Boston. Mass, on Feb. 18
(press release 68 dated February 15).
other hand, I hope I will be able to show on that
we don’t behave as we do because we li c to be
stuffy. We often sound stuffy because we have
learned that anything else may spoil the job we
are trying to do.
I recall a witty passa in the book of an Italian
diplomat describing t 0 Geneva Disarmament
Conference in the early 1930’s. The Italian re-
called that, in regard to every proposition, Am-
bassador Gibson (our re resentative “said noth-
ing and he said it with al reservations.” We can
have our little laugh about that, but I ask you to
think what would have happened to Ambassador
Gibson at that period in our national thinkin if
he had said anything. The whole crux of the dis-
armament meeting was that the continental Euro-
Eean nations, sensitive to the latent menace of a
erman comeback (which later developed), had
no intention of disarmin unless they were given
political guarantees b t e Anglo-Saxon powers.
At that time we won dn’t even agree to consult
with other countries in the event that they were
the victims of aggression. Hence Ambassador
Gibson’s constructive contributions to the Dis-
armament Conference!
Far-Reaching Ellects of Each Decision
The avera e citizen forgets the vast backdrop
against which an American diplomat must project
his recommendations. Any major decision of the
United States aﬂ'ects not only you and me and
the group around the cracker barrel down at the
corner—it will be noted all over the world. Di-
verse interests in the United States will consider
it in the li ht of the way it affects them; they
will seek if they can to derive advantage from
and, if they cannot, to undermine it, occasionally
on the most specious grounds. Foreign nations
will think of it not on] in terms of its immediate
effects but of its signi cance, its pomible use even
through the most distorted interpretation, to ad-
vance their interests. Indonesia will note what
we are doing in Bolivia because both produce tin;
Egypt will note what we are doing in Panama
