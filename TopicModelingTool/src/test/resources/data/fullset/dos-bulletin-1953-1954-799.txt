I talked about the economic problems which were
of eat concern to all of us in this hemisphere
and3r particularly to our American friends to the
south of us. I would like to read a couple of sen-
tences out of that speech:
The United States recognizes that the freedom and in-
dependence which we all covet, and which we are re-
solved to preserve, is based not only on political and moral
considerations but also on economic and social well-being.
The United States Government is conﬁdent of its ability
to maintain the health and vigor of its own national
economy.
Prlvete Capital and Free Enterprise
Then in discussing the ﬂow of capital and what
was needed to produce an expanding economy at a
high level of employment, went on to say:
In the United States, private capital and free enter
prise constitute the great source of our own economic
well-being. That is a source which we do not try to keep
at home. It is free to go abroad, and we welcome its in-
ternational activities. Indeed. President Eisenhower in
his recent Budget Message to Congress recommended cer-
tain modifications in our tax laws which will encourage
our capital and business people to work abroad. How-
ever, private capital cannot be driven. It has to be at-
tracted. Therefore, the decision rests with you.
I refer to these two talks which I made, one
before I entered the Cabinet of President Eisen-
hower, and the other a recent address which I
made in the process of tryin to carry out an ef-
fective American policy, to indicate to you how
vitally important it is, in m judgment, that efforts
such as you are making, an have been making over
recent years, should succeed. If you do not suc—
ceed, if through private activities of the American
people along economic lines they do not provide an
expanding economy, if the do not provide a high
level of employment, and i it is necessary in order
to achieve those things to put the increasing re
sponsibility upon the government in ever-growin
measure, then the demonstration to the world wi 1
be that all we are doing is playing a cor second
to what the Soviet Union is doing an where it is
leadin the way. If we merely become a country
which is trailin along a path which is being blazed
by somebody e se, then it will be Soviet foreign
policy which will be easy to conduct in the world,
just as American foreign policy was easy to con-
duct during the last century. For then most of
the peoples of the world will be looking to the
Soviet Union for leadership. They and not we
will have the environment of admiration and re-
spect, and the ﬂattery of imitation. Should that
happen it will be difﬁcult if not impossible for the
United States to conduct successfully its foreign
policy. Much indeed depends upon you and the
kind of activities which you are so successfully and
so ably promoting in the United States.
I often think back to the opening paragraph in
The Federalist papers, where it says that “it seems
to have been reserved to the people of this country,
by their conduct and example” to show how a free
society can be successfully organized and o erated.
That is the heart of American foreign po icy. It
must be that we can show by our conduct and ex-
am le that a free society can work. When we
fai to show that, when our conduct and example
no longer demonstrate that a free society can give
the fruits which people want and which they de-
mand, then that can be the end of the great role
of our nation’s history. We may coast alon for
a while upon a certain momentum accum ated
out of the great deeds of those who went before us.
But we W111 have undermined the basic concept
upon which our nation was founded—the conduct
and example of a free society. And it is because
I believe that so very strongly that I was ea r
to have the opportunity to come here and, igeI
could, to make clear again to you what I know
you must realize—that your activities are vital to
the successful conduct of American foreign policy.

of Tung Imports
White House press release dated May 19
The President on May 19 directed the United
States Tariff Commission to make an immediate
investigation of the eﬂ'ects of imports of tung oil
and tung nuts on the domestic price support pro-
gram for tung nuts and tun oil and on the amount
of products processed in t United States from
twng nuts or tu oil. The President, having been
advised b the ecretary of Agriculture, directed
the Tani Commission to make its investigation
as ovi ed under Section 532 of the Agricultural
A justment Act, as amended.
The President’s letter to Edgar B. Brossard,
Chairman of the Tariff Commission, follows:
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: I have been advised by
the Secretary of Agriculture that there is reason
to believe that tung oil and tung nuts are practi-
cally certain to be imported into the United States
under such conditions and in such quantities as
to render or tend to render ineffective or to mate-
rially interfere with the price su port program
for tung nuts and tung oil undert en by the De-
partment of Agriculture, pursuant to Section 201
of the Agricultural Ad'ustment Act of 1949, as
amended, or to reduce su stantiall the amount of
products processed in the United tates from do-
mestic tung nuts and tung oil.
The Secretary of Agriculture points out that
the Department of Agriculture has, at present, a
mandatory price support program for tung nuts
and tung oil. He advises me that prices of tung
oil in the United States are below the support price
and have been below since November 1, the begin-
ning of the 1953-54 crop year; and that prices of
tung oil in countries other than the United States
