can meeting as a natural accord of wills without opposi-
tion from any important national interest? We are not,
because of this, better or worse, but more fortunate.
The great achievement of America and of the
nations of the Americas has been the unity it has
achieved and the civilization it has built on the
bases of human dignity, mutual respect, and the
God-given belief that the brotherhood of man is
an achievable ideal. We are proud that not only
tolerance but love of our fellow man is a part of
our credo. And with humility we recognize that
we are the beneﬁciaries, as Dr. Lleras has ointed
out, of what the crucible of history has fas ioned.
The mission of our country, and of all the coun-
tries of the Americas, is to serve as a dynamic
example which can beneﬁt all of mankind.
The brotherhood of Protestants, Catholics, and
Jews, as evidenced by this gathering here in Bos-
ton, is symbolic of the love of our ellow man to
be found throughout the broad reaches of our
country, in the Western Hemisphere, and wherever
in the world man looks out for his brother.
Inﬂuence of Moral Forces
Let us seek for a solution of man’s basic prob-
lem: distrust of one another. This problem does
not lie beyond our power of inﬂuence. For posi-
tive moral forces can exercise tremendous
inﬂuence even in a world of tensions.
And, ﬁnally, since it is the individual who is so
important, we can place our faith in him. B the
acceptance of this rinciple it is a part 0 our
belief that, unless they by their actions and will
prove otherwise, all men are worthy of our trust.
Because of this faith we can be sure that we shall
never lack the leadership of, say a Lincoln or of a
Bolivar, when gloom falls upon the stage of his-
to .
t is on this same concept of justice and moral
order, of international recognition and protection
of human rights and freedom, that United States ‘
support of t e United Nations rests. Throughout
the 9 stormy years of the United Nations we have
held steadfast to the ideal. And no less important,
certainly, we have held, and will I think continue
to hold, to belief in its attainability. As at home
we found it possible to advance toward brother-
hood by respecting the rights and points of view
of others, so must we continue to work for inter-
national brotherhood.
In the meantime, and realism demands that we
look ahead perhaps man years, we rely u on the
coalition of the United tates and other ree na-
tions and a buttressing of our collective security.
For, as you know, not all members of the United
Eatjlons are dedicated to the concept of brother-
00 .
Thus the United Nations reﬂects the kind of
world in which we now live. A considerable ma-
'ority of its members, including, of course, the
nited States, continue to aspire to the goal of
brotherhood. They want agreements, not wars.
They want just political settlements and enduring
eace. They long for a reduction of military
orces and ho e for eventual disarmament. Next
week, in Lon on, a subcommittee of the U.N. Dis-
armament Commission, including a United States
representative, will consider again the complex
problems in its ﬁeld in an effort to ﬁnd a construc-
tive program.
Many have been disturbed by news of recent
nuclear tests in the Paciﬁc, with their indica-
tions of the tremendous destructive force of the
weapons which might be employed in the future.
How to deal with these awesome weapons is part
and parcel of the whole disarmament pro ram.
Repeatedly, the overwhelming majority o the
United Nations has recognized the sense of this
point of view. It has rejected Soviet efforts to
single out a particular kind of weapon for sup-
posed eiimination in exchange for a paper promise
without any safeguards to compel the honoring
of the promise.
It is worth recalling that when the United
States had an absolute mono oly of atomic wea -
ons, we offered to give up t is monopoly in the
interest of world peace—provided that there be
an effective international control system which
would protect all states against violations or
evasions. This was rejected b the Soviet Union,
even though it was acce ted by almost all other
giembers of the United ations except the Soviet
oc.
U.S. Record on Disarmament
The United States record on disarmament is a
good one. It is a record of persistent and sincere
attempts, whether individually or 'oined by our
closest allies, to ﬁnd ways to ease t e costly bur-
den of armaments and lessen the threat of war.
lVe tried in the Atomic Energy Commission. We
tried in the Commission for Conventional Arma-
ments. We tried in special meetings of the six
powers most knowledgeable about atomic ener
matters. lVe proposed the creation of the Dis-
armament Commission, to replace the Atomic En-
ergy and Conventional Armaments Commissions
and to take a fresh look at these difﬁcult problems.
We and our allies introduced proposal after pro-
posal in the Disarmament Commission, only to
ave the Soviet Union refuse even to discuss them.
It was the United Kingdom, France, and the
United States which took the initiative recently to
renew discussions in the Disarmament Commis-
sion and to set up the new subcommittee, now pre-
paring to meet on May 13 in London, to carry on
a fresh attempt to ﬁnd workable solutions.
Our record is highlighted by the fact that, al-
though we have put forward one proposal after
another in unsuccessful efforts to reach agreements
with the Soviet Union, we have not been adamant
