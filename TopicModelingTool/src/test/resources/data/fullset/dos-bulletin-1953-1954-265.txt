There is the further general recognition of the vital im-
portance, for sound development of the world community.
of orderly progress of the nations towards a state of full
economic development, self-government and independence.
And, ﬁnally, international co-operation is recognized as
an essential instrument for a guided development
towards greater social Justice within the nations.
. . There is a tendency to regard social justice
and equality of political and economic rights among
nations—or what may be called international equality——
as being, on the whole, technical and special problems
subordinated to the more urgent one of collective security.
This attitude is understandable and correct, but only
in a short-term perspective. International equality and
justice are prerequisites of the domestic social develop-
ment of all the peoples of the world and, together, they
are the decisive factors if we are to build a world of peace
and freedom. No system of collective security can be
built with snﬂicient strength unless the underlying pres-
sures are reduced—and those pressures can be mastered
only to the extent that we succeed in meeting the demands
for international Justice or internal social justice.
The Secretary-General added that “the efforts of
the United Nations to assist under-developed coun-
tries and its efforts to promote the observance of
human rights should be recognized as contribu-
tions to world peace which are just as basic as its
efforts in the ﬁeld of collective security.”
ll. SOME SPECIAL PROBLEMS
The Greek Problem
The United States was no longer confronted
with si iﬁcant Greek political questions in the
Genera Assembl of the United Nations. Even
that of the Gree children, which had been dis-
cussed in the spring of 1953, did not arise in the
old forms.“
In his remarks before the General Assembly on
September 21, Ambassador Alexis Kyrou, head
of the Greek delegation, touched on the Soviet
“ eace offensive” and noted the persistent refusal
oi) the Soviet satellites to cooperate with the In-
ternational Red Cross in the repatriation either
of the Greek children or of other Greek nationals.
His comments on the problem of (hprus were
also of interest: after reviewing the history of the
problem, Mr. Kyrou said: 1°
British friends. My Government deﬁnitely prefers the
method of friendly bilateral discussion, since that is war-
ranted by the very nature of our long-standing cordial re-
lations with the United Kingdom and by the felicitous
identity of purpose which has always animated the peoples
of the two countries. It is our ardent hope that these views
are shared by our friends in the United Kingdom and that
they, also, consider the task that lies ahead as a worthy
object on which to exert their statesmanship. The door
will always be open for us to go before a judge, if the
ordinary processes of friendly conversations prove to
be of no avail.
The changed situation with respect to Greece Was
underlined on February 28, 1953 when Greece,
Turke , and Yugoslavia signed a Tripartite Pact
provi ing, among other things, for political and
military consultation, economic, technical, and cul-
tural collaboration, and paciﬁc settlement of any
disputes in accordance with the United Nations
Charter. The Soviet “peace offensive” did not
seriously impress the members of the new Balkan
Entente, despite the later exchanges of ambassa—
dors between Greece and Yugoslavia, on the one
hand, and the Soviet Union, on the other. As
Kin Paul of Greece indicated during the visit
whic he and Queen F rederika made to the United
States in October-December 1953, Greece was de-
termined “that the unity of pu ose and under-
standing that we are forming in astern Europe”
should not be “exclusive” but should “become a.
message of be e and daring possibility to some of
our neighbors. ’ 1‘
Early in November the three nations established
a permanent secretariat to deal with matters of
common interest, and on November 20 it was an-
nounced that agreement had been achieved among
the respective general staffs “on all questions re-
lated to the common defense of the three friendly
countries in the event of aggression.” The United
States, of course, welcomed the Entente between
its two NATO allies, Greece and Turkey, and
Yugoslavia, as a contribution to international
peace and security both in Southeastern Europe
and in the Eastern Mediterranean.

“ eace offensive,” ulgaria on June 22 substan-
tially accepted the standing Greek proposal that
