A First Step Toward the Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy
by Lewis L. Strauss
Chairman, Atomic E norgy Commission ‘
The technical limitations of photography in
1863 spared Abraham Lincoln the daily exhorta-
tions of “Just one more, Mr. President,” but it
would have been an intensely interesting archive
for this eneration to be able to see the expressive
face of t 1e great President—for instance, just as
he had delivered his address at Gettysburg. The
ubiquitous camera no longer spares our Presidents.
There is a ﬂashlight photograph of President
Eisenhower taken within a few moments after he
had resumed his seat in the great assembly hall of
the United Nations and just as the prolonged ap-
lause had begun—ap lause which is almost un-
known in that august c amber and which was the
recursor of the worldwide acclaim that greeted
his historic address.2 The picture is a very mov~
ing one. It is the face of a man who had suc-
ceeded in communicatin his profoundest convic-
tions to his hearers while they were responding
spontaneously and with obvious feeling. What
may well be a reat moment in the history of the
world is recor ed and epitomized in that photo-
graph.
By now a great deal has been said about the
December 8th address. It was not a hastily put
together 5 eech. It is true that the invitation to
yipear be ore the General Assembly of the United
ations was onl received while the President was
in Bermuda an it presented an appropriate, in-
deed an ideal, forum for the occasion. But the
speech itself had been long in composition and
even longer in the President 5 mind. Every ara-
graph, every word in it, had been weighe and
considered by him. He had written and rewritten
it and could have delivered it had he cared to do
so without beneﬁt of manuscript.
Like other great addresses, it was not long—only
some 3,000 words. Edward Everett’s oration at
Gettysburg on the famous day in 1863 took up-
‘Address made before the Los Angeles World Affairs
Council on Apr. 19; released to the press on the same date
by the Atomic Energy Commission.

wards of an hour to deliver and is forgotten.
President Eisenhower’s brief speech had two ma-
'or purposes. One was to tell the world in the new
language of the atomic age of what humanity faced
if it could not escape another war. The other
purpose was to propose an alternative to the head-
ong race of nations toward that precipice.
The ﬁrst part was roughly two-thirds of the
speech. In measured phrases which could not be
misunderstood, the President described the force
of the new weapons with which science and engi-
neerin had stocked the military arsenals of at
least t ree nations. He said that he sought that
day to speak in a language which he would have
preferred never to use, the new language of atomic
warfare. “Atomic bombs,” he said, “today are
more than 25 times as powerful as the weapons
with which the atomic age dawned, while h dro-
gen weapons are in the ranges of millions 0 tons
of TNT equivalent.” He continued, “Today, the
United States’ stockpile of atomic weapons, which,
of course, increases daily, exceeds b man times
the explosive equivalent of the tote of al bombs
and al shells that came from eve plane and
every gun in every theatre of war in all of the
years of World War II.”
But so profound was the effect of the latter
part of the address, so eat the yearning of the
world for some light in t e gathering gloom of an
atomic armament race, so welcome any hope for
reducing the threat of atomic destruction by any
amount or means, that there was surprisingl little
note of the content of the ﬁrst art of the a dress.
It was, in fact, overshadowe in both news and
editorial reaction.
The current series of weapons tests at our Paciﬁc
Proving Ground, however, has effectively drama-
tized the earlier part of the s eech. I hope it has
reminded many who had a most for otten the
fact that the Soviets tested a thermonuc ear device
in August of last year. A little examination of
the calendar also reveals that, had we not begun
our researches when we did, we might now be in
a position of weapon inferiority to the Soviet
