glad to say—so far been called upon to demon-
strate under odds as heavy as those the Chinese
themselves have had to face: courage, hardihood,
endurance.
Our two peoples, I believe, want the same kind
of world—a world in which there will be a mini-
mum of strutting authorit , a world in which or-
dinary human beings wil be left alone to earn
their livelihood, to cultivate their gardens, to en-
'oy their homes and their children and not be
ullied or robbed in the name of any high-sound-
ing rhetoric.
American Hopes for Chlnl
It is for all thesa reasons that no wish is closer
to the heart of the American people than that
China shall be herself again. It is in witness of
that hope that two American destro ers today
are being transferred to the Chinese ag. These
vessels are symbols of our abiding faith in China
and of our conviction that China will a ain as
always in the past, prove stronger than t e alien
intruder. We believe these ships will contribute
to bringing nearer the da when China will again
belong unreservedl to t e Chinese. In passing
to the command 0 the Republic of China, they
go to strengthen a overnment that is at once a
symbol and a fruit 0 the inextinguishable Chinese
s irit.
pRecently, 14,000 Chinese prisoners of war in
Korea, by choosing to forsake the ties of family
and community in order to live under a truly
Chinese ﬂa , exposed the fraudulence of the claims
of the ant oritIes in Peiping to speak with the
voice of China. The pass10nate determination of
so many soldiers from their command not to re-
turn to Communist rule clearly came as a great
shock to those authorities. It did not surprise
us in the least. There has never been any ques-
tion in our minds as to how the Chinese people
would choose if given the choice between a govern-
ment rooted in Chinese traditions and one that
has made of China a handmaiden of an alien im-
perialism. It is because of what we know of the
Chinese people’s abilit to endure the most malig-
nant fortune without eing crushed by it or sur-
renderin to it that we have no doubt of the out-
come of hina’s resent travail.
Mr. Ambassa or, the missions that lie ahead
for the Han any and the L0 any, as these ships
are to be ca led, and their 0 cers and men, are
important ones: to strengthen the defense of the
Paciﬁc, upon which our nations jointly front, co-
operating with our own Seventh Fleet, and to
represent and defend the cause of China’s free-
dom. These are tasks worthy of the names of
the ancient and historic cities these ships will
bear. They are tasks worthy of the great naval
tradition in which these ships were ﬁrst manned.
We are conﬁdent that China has chosen well
in selecting you, the ofﬁcers and men of the Han-
yang and Loyang, to take these ships to their duty
stations and to man them in the carrying out of
their responsibilities. We feel sure that you take
with you more than the technical skills you have
a aired in your brief months of trainin at Nor-
fglk We believe you will take with you rsthand
knowledge of the esteem, good will, and lasting
friendship that our people feel for yours.
We wish you Godspeed and success in all your
undertakings.

LETTER TO PRIME MINISTER NEI'IRU
DEAR MR. PRIME MINISTER: I send you this per-
sonal message because I want you to know about
my decision to extend military aid to Pakistan
before it is public knowledge and also because
I want you to know directly from me that this
step does not in any way affect the friendship
we feel for India. Quite the contrary. We will
continually strive to strengthen the warm and
enduring friendship between our two countries.
Our two Governments have agreed that our
desires for peace are in accord. It has also been
understood that if our interpretation of existing
circumstances and our belief in how to achieve
our goals diﬁ'er, it is the right and duty of sov-
ereign nations to make their own decisions. Hav-
ing studied long and carefully the problem of
opposing possible aggression in the Middle East,
I believe that consultation between Pakistan and
Turkey about security problems will serve the
interests not only of Pakistan and Turkey but
also of the whole free world.1 Improvement in
Pakistan’s defensive capability will also serve these
interests and it is for this reason that our aid will
be given. This Government’s views on this sub-
ject are elaborated in a public statement I will
release, a copy of which Ambassador Allen will
give you.
that we are proposing to do, and what Pakistan
is agreeing to, is not directed in any way against
