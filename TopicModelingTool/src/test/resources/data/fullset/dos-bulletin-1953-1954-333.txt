of competent military forces an where on our
side of the Iron Curtain in the ar East must
make the Communists that much more reluctant
to attack anywhere else. The military forces of
the Republic of Korea for example, are defending
the countries of Southeast Asia, as well as their
own country, simply by maintaining their present
impressive capabilities—even if they never budge
from Korea or ﬁre a shot. The long-range Ameri-
can striking forces called for by our present
strategy of defense are also calculated to deter
ag ion by the mere fact of their existence.
t is essential for the Asians to have something
to ﬁght with, but it is even more important for
them to have something to ﬁght for—or rather
for them to realize how much they have to ﬁght
for, including the chance to achieve something
better. It is much easier for us to provide weap-
ons, however cost] the operation may be, than
to provide conviction and faith. You may ask
whether the Asians do not recognize that any peo-
ple menaced by communism have everything to
ght for, above all for their independence. My
answer would be that the Asians are passionately
attached to their independence. I would further
submit that the vast majority of Asians are pro-
foundly opposed to what communism consists of.
I would even hazard the ess that nowhere in
Asia, including China and iet-Nam, could Com-
munists, running as such, poll as heavy a per-
centage of the vote in a fair election today as
they have in arts of the West. 0
But I woul also point out that, while a growmg
knowledge of realities in the Communist worl
has gone a long way in disabusin the Asians—
as it has the rest of the world—of illusions about
communism, there are still many Asians who do
not know what communism is and who accept its
retensions uncritically, deriving no small satis-
action from the discomﬁture the Communists ap-
arently cause the West. For those Asians who
have had experience of Western overlords and of
feudal overlords of their own but who have seen
nothin of Communist tyranny, it is not unnatural
to thin of communism in terms of economic and
social radicalism, which is appealin , rather than
in terms of Soviet Russmn an Communist
Chinese reactionary imperialism. At the same
time, most of the population of Asia is living in
circumstances that even by Asia’s own pathetic
standards are des erate.
The Asian revo ution, insofar as it is a national-
ist revolution, is today living on borrowed time.
An improvement has got to be shown in the condi-
tions in which the vast majority of Asians live.
Such an improvement cannot be taken for granted.
Many Asians are worse off today than before the
war, and the falling prices of Southeast Asian raw-
material exports and the difﬁculties Japan is hav-
ing to surmount in rebuilding her foreign trade
can mean destitution for tens of millions of human
beings—human beings who cannot be expected to
submit to starvation because they are told that
communism would be worse.
Eeonomlc Ald and Technical Assistance
What the United States is trying to do is to
extend economic aid and technical assistance where
it will count for the most, where the economic and
social structures of the new Asian nations are
weakest. We cannot give aid of a magnitude that
would industrialize Asia in a matter of years or
cause dramatic chan es in the standards of living
of 700 million peop e. But we can help bring
about speciﬁc improvements—say in trans orta-
tion systems, in small industries, in public ad-
ministration, in agriculture methods, in the
diversiﬁcation of production—that will help create
a constructive atmosphere, an atmos here of hope,
a climate of conﬁdence in Free Xsia’s present
nationalist, moderate leadership. Further, we can
take the lead in reducing those arbitrary barriers
to the wider development of Asia’s resources and
the world’s resources—high tariffs, uota systems,
and the like—by which a nation see 3 to live in a
world apart when the survival of all depends on
common effort.
The report of the Randall Commission on US.
foreign economic policy,2 released at the end of
January, stressed the importance of reducing our
tariﬂ's. It also recommended that our technical
coo eration programs be pressed forward vigor-
ous y; that our overnment extend loans to coun-
tries where substantial economic aid is necessary
in our interests and cannot be provided by private
or international sources; that our Government
contribute all it can to the creation abroad of a
climate conducive to private foreign investment.
In all these ways we could ive the Asian eoples
a greater stake in their new y won independbnce.
To appreciate the situation in the Far East, you
should hear not only what the United States is
gycilng to do but what some others say it is trying
0.
This is from the Peoples Dail Editorial, North
China News Agency, in Englis Morse to South-
east Asia, Europe, and North America, December
19,1953:
The American imperialists, who have been supporting
the French aggressive war against VietNam, are stub-
bornly pursuing the policy of prolonging and expanding
the war in VietNam. . It is American imperialism
which is the most vicious enemy of the Vietnamese and
all peoples demanding liberty and independence. At the
same time, American imperialism is seriously jeopardiz-
ing the national interests and independence of France.
As is universally known, the U. S. is taking advantage of
the situation in which France is being bogged down and
weakened by the war in VietNam to coerce the French
Government into subordination.
