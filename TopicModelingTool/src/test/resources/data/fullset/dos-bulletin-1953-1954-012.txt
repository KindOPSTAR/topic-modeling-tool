7. The Council recognized that a long-term de-
fence system as now envisaged raises important
milita and ﬁnancial problems. With respect to
the mi itary problems, the Council invited the
Military Committee to continue its re-assessment
of the most effective pattern of military forces, for
this long term, both active and reserve, due re-
gard being paid to the results of studies of the
eﬂect of new weapons. The Council will be kept
informed of the (progress of this work and a report
will be submitte to it in due course. The Council
will also keep under review the very considerable
ﬁnancial eﬂ'ort still required to continue the pres-
ent build-up, to maintain NATO forces at an
adequate level of readiness and to replace obso-
lescent wea ns.
8. The uncil heard statements by Admiral
Sir John Edelsten, Commander-in-Chief Channel,
Admiral L. D. McCormick, Supreme Allied Com-
mander Atlantic and General Alfred M. Gruen-
ther, Su reme Allied Commander Europe, on the
work ac ieved in their Commands, and took note
of a r0 ress report by the Military Committee.
9. n t e course of its review the Council con-
sidered the Secretary General’s Report and wel-
comed the progress recorded since the last Min-
isterial Meeting in A ril.‘ It emphasized the im-
portance of the wor being done to co-ordinate
national planning in such matters as civil defence,
the wartime control and distribution of commodi-
ties and of shipping and other means of transport.
Agreement was expressed with Lord Ismay’s view
that the preparations by member governments in
these ﬁelds should parallel the progress alread
achieved in the military ﬁeld. The Council too
note that the problems of manpower had been
kept under review and that several recommenda-
tions to governments had been approved. Prog-
ress which had been achieved this year in prepar-
ing correlated production programmes was we]-
comed. These programmes cover production, for
several years ahead, of important ranges of mili-
tary equipment. The Council expressed satisfac-
tion with the Secretary General’s Report on the
implementation of the common infrastructure
programmes. Besides a large number of projects
now under construction, no less than 120 airﬁelds
and a large network of signals communications
facilities are in use by Na'ro forces.
10. Ministers took the opportunity to meet to-
gether in restricted session and discussed infor-
mally matters of interest to all the member gov-
ernments. They intend at future meetings to
continue this procedure, which developed natu-
rally from the sense of unity in the Alliance.
They are continually mindful of the political
links which bind them in an Alliance which is not
solely military in character.

Soviet Union Delays
Four Power Meetlng
Press release 676 dated December 26
The Soviet Union on December 26, after 18 days
of deliberation, advised that it will meet in Berlin
but not on January 4 as the Governments of
France, the United Kingdom, and the United
States had proposed.1 It suggests January 25 “or
any subsequent day” as suita le for the meeting.
It says that this later date is a “necessity for ap-
propriate preparation.” This seems somewhat
curious in ight of the fact that the three-power
invitation to the Soviet Union has been outstand-
ing since last Jul . In suggesting a postpone-
ment, the Soviet nion refers to the necessnty of
assuring proper conditions of participation in this
conference for all four Governments. The Soviet
Union presumably has solicitude for other lar-
ticipating governments and assumes that it is t-
ter quali ed than the Governments of France, the
United Kingdom, and the United States to decide
what best suits their own interests.
The US. Government will promptly exchan e
views with the Governments of France and e
United Kingdom in order to prepare an early
reply to the oviet Union. The Soviet note would
appear to delay for 3 weeks but not to revent
this meeting which the three Western owers
have long sought and to which they attach high
importance.
Sovlet Response to
0.5. AtomlclProposal
Statement by Secretary Dulles
Press release 666 dated December 21
The Soviet Minister for Foreign Aﬂ'airs has
now delivered to Ambassador Bohlen, and has
broadcast, the response of the Soviet Union to
President Eisenhower’s address of December 8
before the United Nations.2 President Eisen-
hower’s address carried to every corner of the
globe hope for the recession of the horror of
atomic warfare.
The United States was ready, the President said,
to meet privately with such other countries as may
be principally involved, including the Soviet
Union, to seek an acceptable solution to the atomic
armaments race. Into those talks the United
States would carry a new conception for a “world
bank” under the auspices of the United Nations,
into which nations possessing normal uranium and
ﬁssionable materials would make contributions for
