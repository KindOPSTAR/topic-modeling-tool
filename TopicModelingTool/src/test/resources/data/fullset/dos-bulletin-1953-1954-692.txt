I address myself ﬁrst to the report of the group
of experts on commodity trade and economic de-
velopment. The experts were required to include
in their report some consideration of the problem
of long-term changes in the relation between the
prices of primary commodities and the prices of
manufactured articles. This is a subject which
has been much discussed both in the United Na-
tions and in other international forums. The con-
clusions reached by the experts correspond to those
presented in the report on Measures for Interna-
tional Economic Stability which a different group
of experts, also ap ointed under a U.N. resolution,
submitted to this ouncil in 1951. These conclu-
sions are also similar to those my Government has
expressed on a number of occasions. Their es-
sence is this: It would be neither desirable nor
practicable to attempt to change the long-term
relationship of prices between primary commodi-
ties and manufactured goods which tends to be
established by the operation of competitive mar-
ket forces. The experts accordingly reject any
proposals designed to change artiﬁcially the long-
term course of price relationships between pn-
mary and manufactured commodities. I think
that their work in this ﬁeld has been most useful
and realistic and I commend them for it. I should
like also to pay my tribute to the Secretariat for
the series of informative and germane studies pre-
sented under item 3 (b). These provide helpful
factual and other data which supplement the
work of the experts on long-term internationa]
price relationships but in no way disturb their
conclusions.
Prlce Instablllty In Primary Commodities
The experts direct their attention chieﬂy to the
problem of extreme short-term price ﬂuctuations
within the lon -term trend. Such price swings
present difficulties for all countries, but especially
for those less developed countries which depend
mainly for their foreign exchange earnings on the
exports of only one or two primary commodities.
Wide ﬂuctuations and uncertain foreign exchange
earnings may entail economic hardship and im-
pede the steady progress of economic development.
The problem of marked price instability in pri-
mary commodity markets is, therefore, one with
which my Government and all governments of
the free world must be greatly concerned. As to
the desirability of reducing this instability, there
can be no disagreement. The problem to be faced
is how this can be safely accomplished. Devices
that serve tem orarily to reduce rice ﬂuctuations
must be 'udgeg by their potentia ities for contrib-
uting to ealthy economic growth. They may re-
tard rather than promote such growth if they in-
terfere with long-term price trends and introduce
rigidities and restraints that impair the elasticity
of economic adjustment which is fundamental to
economic progress.
This is a danger which must be faced in the
consideration of proposals for governmental com-
modity arrangements. This danger and the great
practical difﬁculties involved in reaching accord
on the details of any contem lated arrangement
largely explain why so few mternational agree-
ments involving consuming as well as producing
countries have hitherto been reached. The ex-
perts recognize this situation and see little pros-
pect of any substantial increase in the number of
agreements. My delegation shares this view.
The experts also believe, however, that commod-
ity agreements, if properl drawn and operated,
may be an effective means or preventing excessive
price ﬂuctuation. This they hope might be ob-
tained if the attempt were made to cover several
commodities in a single agreement, instead of re-
lying on the inevitably slow and uncertain increase
in single commodit agreements.
I must confess, r. President, that I ﬁnd no
ground to justify this hope. The difﬁculties
experienced in negotiations relating to a single
commodity would in my judgment be greatly mul-
ti plied if we attempted to deal with many commod-
ities at the same time. Moreover, any a eement
covering many commodities would invo ve wide-
spread interference with the workings of a free
world econom . It would magnify the danger of
diverting pro uction, consumption, and trade pat-
terns from the channels the would be likely to
assume under a more healt y, com etitive, and
free enterprise system. The net resu t of such ar-
rangements, even if it were practicable to conclude
them, would, I ﬁrmly believe, be detrimental and
not beneﬁcial to economic development.
The experts extend their proposals for compre-
hensive commodity stabilization arrangements by
recommending for further study a “commodity re-
serve currency scheme.” If this were an academic
seminar we might, Mr. President, ﬁnd some inter-
est in discussing the complexities of this by no
means novel roposal. T is, however, is not an
exercise in w ich I would care to engage in this
forum. I see no likelihood whatever that my Gov-
ernment would be disposed to give this scheme any
serious consideration in the foreseeable future.
I feel sure that other delegations will share my
view that the scheme is impractical. I hope there-
fore that the Council will not devote time and
energy which might well be spent in more useful
activities to detailed examination of a proposal
that would seem to have no chance whatever of
acceptance by governments.
The experts recommend—and this is their most
speciﬁc proposal—the establishment by the Coun-
cil of a “Trade Stabilization Commission.” This
Commission would be concerned with proposals
for dealing with the problem of stabilization gen-
erally. It would leave undisturbed the existing
international machinery, such as the Interim Co-
ordinating Committee for International Commod-
ity Arrangements and its associated study groups,
