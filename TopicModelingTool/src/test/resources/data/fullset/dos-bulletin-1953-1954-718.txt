pet government. The Soviet maneuver has fooled
no one and no standing will be accorded to the
regime by the free nations of the world.
The Refugee Problem
That there have been two million refugees from
the Russian Zone to the Federal Re ublic in the
last 3 years will surprise no one. he stream is
continuing at the rate of some 20,000 a month. For
the last year the Russians have permitted relatively
free travel between their zone and the rest of Ger-
many—I emphasize the word relative for the num-
ber of ports of entry are few indeed and the trafﬁc
is strictly controlled. The border between the Rus-
sian Zone and the Federal Re ublic is marked by
barbed-wire fences, a plowe strip, and armed
guards at ever turn. But the relatively free
travel means t at as many refu ees now come
across the border as through Ber in. This con-
tinued inﬂux of several hundred thousand a year
added to the 10 million refugees already in West
Germany presents the Federal Republic with a
serious problem.
In recent months, as you are well aware, the
Russians have been doing all in their power to at-
tempt to raise the prestige of their satellite gov-
ernment, the so-called German Democratic Re ub-
lic referred to colloquially in Germany as the an-
kow re ime. Mr. Molotov at the Berlin Confer-
ence asied for the representatives of this overn-
ment to come to the conference. When challenged
by Mr. Dulles as to the legitimacy of this govern-
ment and twitted about the forced election methods
used to choose the Legislative Assembly in his
zone, he unashamedly defended the Soviet concept
of free elections. Both in his remarks and subse-
quent articles in the East Berlin ress, the system
of elections with the help of Soviet-controlled
unity lists was deﬁned as the “only free and demo-
cratic” method of choosing representatives. The
results of such elections (farcical from our point
of view) were contrasted with what happens when
in Soviet terminology militarists and capitalists
are allowed to compete as they did in the elections
of September which resulted in the return to
Eower of Chancellor Adenauer in the Federal
epublic.
Soviet Intentions
More than one observer of the Berlin Confer-
ence has drawn the conclusion from Mr. Molotov’s
amazingly frank attitude that he was quite un-
willing to consider proposals for free elections in
all of Germany ﬁrst of all because he did not wish
to relinquish his control of the Russian Zone, and
furthermore because he had his eyes ﬁxed on the
ultimate control of all of Germany itself. I shall
long remember his cynical contempt for demo-
cratic procedures when he warned us: “We must
not be carried away by parliamentary formalities
and the or anizational and technical as )ec‘ts of this
matter”; ‘this matter” happened to e the idea
proposed by the United States, Great Britain, and
France and desired by all Germans of holding free
and democratic elections throughout Germany.
But Mr. Molotov thought that we were “carried
way by formal constitutionalism.” It seemed to
some of us that he was anxious to support his
puppet regime in the Russian Zone for several
reasons. First, for the sake of the presti e of
those Germans who had cast their lot in wit the
Russians; second, because he needed to support
the prestige of the satellite overnments in P0-
land, Czechoslovakia, and near y lands; and third,
because he was pre aring his case for the extension
some day of his e ectoral methods to all of Ger-
many. He seemed to have his eye on a future
which would come when the wedge he was trying
to drive between the Western allies ﬁnally
found a weak spot and opened enormous cracks.
That Mr. Molotov and his colleagues in the Krem-
lin may dream such dreams at the present moment
may seem fantastic. However whether it may
sound im ossible to us here and whether it is dis-
believed y every German matters little to the
men of the Kremlin. Mr. Molotov may assume
that some day the present American foreign olicy
will weaken and our economic structure co apse,
that the American military forces will no longer
consider Europe the outpost of their own defense,
that the French and the Germans will renew their
old hostility and be ready to stab each other in the
back, that the whole free world will go through
a major depression with a consequent vast unem-
ployment in Western Germany. Under such a set
of circumstances, the masters of the Soviet Union
would be indeed in a position to talk about the
German roblem in far different tones from those
we hear in Berlin last January.
Let me remind you that tonight I have promised
not to be a prophet. My last few sentences have
dealt only with what may well be a prophetic
vision in the eyes of the dwellers of the Kremlin.
If I am at all right in this supposition, then the
task for us in the free world 1s to do all in our
power to prevent the future resembling in any way
that which Mr. Molotov and his associates may
hopeful] have in mind, and in this regard the
United tates and West German at present see
eye to eye. For, as I have alrea y re orted, the
German leaders seem anxious to wor for some
type of European integration; among the youth
of Germany today the ideal of a new type of Euro-
pean community has a powerful hold. One need
not be a prophet to say that the future of free
Europe depends on the future relations of Ger-
many and France; in spite of many discourage-
ments of the past few years, I believe the signs
are still predominantly favorable for continued
progress toward European cooperation.
