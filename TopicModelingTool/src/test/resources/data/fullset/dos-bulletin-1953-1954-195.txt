The Scandinavian Splrlt
by Walter S. Robertson ‘
As an ofﬁcial both of the United States De art-
ment of State and of the Virginia Museum of ine
Arts, and I must say I had never anticipated act-
ing as both simultaneously, I have been asked to
express the gratitude and appreciation of the
American people for the exhibition, “Design in
Scandinavia,” which we have come here this eve-
ning to open. I should say at once that, in my
experience, very few developments as momentous
as this can be regarded with unalloyed satisfac-
tion and enthusiasm. This is one of the rare ones.
I shall not be betraying a state Secret if I confess
that sometimes in the Department of State we give
ourselves a little wry amusement by eeting a
colleague in the corridor with the question “Have
you heard what has happened now?” and watch-
ing his face take on a 00k of apprehension and
alarm. Such are the times in which we live; and
in such times as these, it is the greatest pleasure to
be able to take part in an event like this one from
which only good, and very great good, can result.
We may be thankful not only for the event itself
but for the recognition its importance has received.
Their Majesties, the Kings of Norway, Denmark,
and Sweden, and Their Excellencies, the President
of Finland and the President of the United States,
are sponsoring the exhibit. Great nations have
never embarked on solemn enterprises of martial
portent under more august auspices. But this is
an enterprise in a peaceful cause, in the cause of
cultural interchange, a cause in which there are
no national barriers, in which men of all countries
may meet in the fellowship of a common ideal and
of a common medium of communication.
This exhibition contains over 700 articles of
kinds that are in general daily use, articles of wood
and textile, china, glass, and metal. They will
remind us most dramatically of the great change
that has taken lace since the days when only a
ducal household) was privileged to possess such
beauty as came, for exam le, from a silversmith
like Benvenuto Cellini. hey will remind us too,
that the industrial revolution, with its emphasis
on mass production, has not condemned us to ugli-
ness in our daily lives. The will show us that, as
a result of the feeling for unction and material
that characterizes the work of such modern de-
signers as those of Scandinavia, it is possible to
live in a world in which the commonplace need not
be depressing and futile but may be a source of
ever-fresh esthetic satisfaction and delight.
Under the auspices of the American Federation
of Arts, the exhibition will be shown, during the
next 3% years, in the leading museums of the
' Address made at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts,
Richmond, Va., on Jan. 15. Mr. Robertson, who is Assist—
ant Secretary for Far Eastern Affairs, is vice president
of the museum.
United States and Canada. No such exhibition
has ever before had such a tour in our country.
Hi h ex ctations of it have been aroused and
wil not e disa pointed. We should expect the
best even if we id not know that, in the ﬁeld of
contemporary design, the Scandinavians are pre-
eminent. For whatever our particular interest,
we are accustomed to looking to the four Scandi-
navian countries for examples of the highest
standards of performance in our ﬁeld. This is
true whether we be athletes or organizers of co-
operatives, foresters or industrialists, seamen or
novelists, engineers or com osers.
Admiration for the Scan inavians is proverbial
among us. We like them not just because they
are so good at so many things. We like them
not just because so many of our most valuable
citizens are of Scandinavian descent. We like
them not just because they ﬁrst discovered North
America. Indeed, we cannot consider it very ﬂat-
tering that after having pioneered in crossin the
Atlantic—as the have pioneered in so much e se—
our discoverers ound nothing here to bring them
back for over half a millennium.
What we particularly admire about the Scandi-
navian countries is that they are so notably self-
reliant and inde ndent in spirit, while at the
same time so nota 1y ready to cooperate with other
countries for the sake of the universal welfare
and to champion the rights of others, particularly
the rights of the weak against the powerful of the
indivrdual against the mass. But that is only part
of the reason, I believe, why the four countries
of Scandinavia stand in such high regard not
only here but in all other parts of the world with
which I am familiar. The reason has to do with
what we mi ht call the Scandinavian values. To
a remarkab e degree, the Scandinavian eo les
have achieved the good life, the well-roun ed ife,
the healthy, outgom , creative life, the life that
makes the most of w at is available and does not
seek to take from others that which is theirs or to
impose upon others that which the do not want.
Peoples reveal in their art what t ey essentially
are. Most of all, I believe, our true nature is re-
ﬂected in the design of those things like houses
and dishes, fabrics and eating utensils that are so
close to us that they are like parts of ourselves.
I ﬁnd it particularly ﬁtting that we should receive
from Scandinavia, where the human values are
preeminent, examples of art of an intrinsically
uman character. The exhibition that has been
sent us will not only extend our conception of
beaut but will enhance our understanding of the
Scan inavian spirit. On both counts it will en-
rich our experience. I hope our gratitude may be
conveyed to the high sponsors of the exhibit in
Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, to the
creators of the pieces composing it, to those who
have worked hard to bring it here, and to the
peoples whose way of life is symbolized in “De-
sign in Scandinavia.”
