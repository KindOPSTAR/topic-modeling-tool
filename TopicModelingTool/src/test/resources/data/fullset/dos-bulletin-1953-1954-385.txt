esolution.
In an effort to arrange the conference, Ambassa-
dor Dean carried on conversations with the
Chinese and North Korean Communists at Pan-
munjom from October 26 until December 12. The
Communist side adopted an attitude of complete
intransigence. It proved impossible to negotiate
at Panmunjom the needed simple arrangements for
the projected conference. Finally, the refusal of
the Communist side to negotiate in ood faith and
its intolerable insults agalnst the .S. resulted in
a decision by Mr. Dean to suspend the talks until
the Communists showed a disposition to withdraw
their baseless charges and to negotiate seriously.
No such disposition had been manifested by the
Communist side when the four Foreign Ministers
convened at Berlin.
Korean Pelltleal Conference Arranged
The Berlin meeting had been convened to dis-
cuss European problems and therefore did not
seem the proper place to discuss arrangements for
a Korean Political Conference. However, when
Mr. Molotov, 0n the ﬁrst day of the Conference,
insisted on introducing as item 1 of his draft
agenda a proposal to consider measures for re-
ducing tension in international relations throu h
the convenin of a meeting of Ministers or
Foreign Affairs of France, the U.K., the Soviet
Union, the U.S. and Communist China, and the
three Western Ministers agreed to debate this
proposal, the occasion seemed opportune to ex-
plore the possibility of concluding the necessary
arrangements for the Korean Political Conference
under item 1 of the agenda. This was done, and
as a result a proposal which we had been advoca-
ting for several months was successfully substi-
tuted for the entirel unacce table “Five Power
Conference” proposa which t e Soviet Union was
endeavoring to press upon the Western Foreign
Ministers.
Mr. Molotov was 'ven to understand from the
outset that no specia big power status, or indeed
any position of preferment or prestige, would be
accorded to Communist China by the three West-
ern Foreign Ministers. Thus Mr. Molotov’s pro-
posal for a ﬁve-power conference, including Red
China, on the subject of relaxation of world ten-
sions was completely rejected. We made it clear
that we would deal with the unrecognized Peiping
regime only in relation to concrete local problems
of war and peace where it is a necessary party.
The eventual acceptance of the Western pro-
posal for a Korean Political Conference demon-
strated once again that a policy of ﬁrmness pays
off in dealing with the Communist countries. By
making an unequivocal stand on a basis of prin-
ciple, agreement was achieved on a Korean Politi-
cal Conference which is in accord with the letter
and the spirit of the U.N. General Assembly Reso-
lution. Provision is made for the full participa-
tion of the Republic of Korea and all the countries
which contributed forces to the UN. Command in
Korea; the Soviet Union will be a full participant
and will have joint responsibility for any agree-
ments which may be reached; neutrals are ex-
cluded; and the conference will be held at Geneva,
the lace ﬁrst proposed by the U.S.
T e stage is now set for the stron st effort that
can be made, under the most favora le conditions
that could be expected, to attain the peaceful uni-
ﬁcation of Korea under a representative govern-
ment.
The resolution of February 18, which provides
for the Korean Political Conference at Geneva,
also stipulates that the problem of restorin peace
in Indochina will be discussed at the con erence.
Re resentatives of the U.S., France, the U.K., the
U.S.S.R., the Chinese Communists, and “other in-
terested states” are to be invited to these discus-
srons.
Secretary Dulles in a speech which he made last
September at St. Louis ‘ pointed out that out of the
Korean Political Conference could come, if Com-
munist China willed it, a restoration of peace
in Indochina. The Indochina paragraph of the
February 18 resolution is consonant with this
observation.
It remains to be seen whether the Communist
side has any will for peace in Indochina. Cer-
tainly a cessation of the support of the Communist
Viet Minh by the Chinese Communists would be
one indication of such a will for peace.
We feel that, as believers in peace with honor,
an obligation rests upon us to explore every pos-
sible avenue to eace in these two sorely tried
areas—Korea an Indochina. In so doing, we are
not com romising our basic principles; the word-
ing of t e resolution makes that explicit.
Neither will we allow an unproductive con-
ference to drag on indeﬁnitely. If it should
become evident that attempts at constructive nego-
tiation on our part are meeting with no response
from the Communist side, or if the Communists
should attempt to transform the conference into
a propaganda sounding board by departing from
the strictly limited agenda to which we have
agreed, there would be no point in rolonging the
conference. In any event we shall ave the satis-
faction of knowing that we have left no stone un-
turned in our effort to seek an acceptable peace in
the two principal areas of Communist aggression
in the Far East.
What were the Soviet motives in agreeing to
this Korean Political Conference at Geneva when
the Chinese Communists at Panmunjom had vio-
lently opposed the same formula for a conference?
It is probable that the Soviets and the Chinese
Communists were inﬂuenced in part by our ﬁrm
