Tax Conventions With Greece
Enter Into Force
Press release 18 dated January 16
On January 15, 1954, the President proclaimed
the income-tax and estate-tax conventions between
the United States and Greece. Those two conven-
tions for the avoidance of double taxation and the
prevention of ﬁscal evasion, one relating to taxes
on income and the other relating to taxes on the
estates of deceased persons, were signed at VVash-
ington on February 20, 1950.
hey were approved by the US. Senate on
September 17, 1951, subject in the case of the
income-tax convention to an understanding and
in the case of the estate-tax convention to a reser-
vation relating to the application of certain pro-
visions involvmg assistance in connection with
the collection of taxes.
After communicating the understanding and
reservation to the Greek Government and receiving
from that Government assurances concerning their
acceptabilit , the President ratiﬁed the two con-
ventions on half of the United States on Decem-
ber 5, 1951, subject in the one case to the under-
standing and in the other case to the reservation.
According to the provisions of each of the con-
ventions, the instruments of ratiﬁcation were to
be exchanged at Athens. Final arrangements for
the exchange were made in December 1953, after
the completion of necessary parliamentary proce-
dures in Greece.
The instruments of ratiﬁcation with res ct to
both conventions were exchanged on Decem r 30,
1953, whereupon the conventions entered into force
in accordance with their respective terms. The
income-tax convention is effective as of January 1,
1953. The estate-tax convention is effective be-
ginning December 30, 1953, applicable solely to
estates or inheritances in the case of persons dying
on or after that date.
The provisions of the conventions follow, in
neral, the pattern of tax conventions entered
rnto by the United States with a number of other
countries. The income-tax conventions are de-
signed to remove an undesirable impediment to
international trade and economic development by
doing away as far as possible with double taxation
on the same income. The estate-tax conventions
are designed to eliminate double taxation in con-
nection with the settlement in one country of
estates in which nationals of the other country
have interests.
So far as the United States is concerned, the
conventions apply only with respect to United
States ( that is, ederal) taxes. They do not apply
to the 1m osition of taxes by the several States,
the Distrlct of Columbia, or the territories or
possessions of the United States.
