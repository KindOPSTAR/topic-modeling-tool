tyranny denies the Korean people their longed-
for unity, and that this is a monstrous injustice.
That is true. Obviously it must be a matter of
re t to all of us that Communist ower was not
driven back beyond the Yalu and umen Rivers
from whence it came into Korea as a foreign in-
vader. In addition to our concern for the K0-
reans still under Chinese Communist rule, we must
recognize that the fact that the Chinese Com-
mumsts were not expelled from the whole of
Korea has made them look more formidable in
some parts of the world. And this is not only
unfortunate but ironical. For among the na-
tions with whom the Chinese Communists have
perhaps acquired this more imposing appearance
are those who were particularly unfavorable to a
home-thrust against Communist China and whose
views the Unlted Nations Command necessarily
took into account.
Historians will be debating for years to come
the factors for and against a wider application
of American military power in the Korean con-
ﬂict. It is not my intention, however, to enter
into this debate althou h I have stron personal
views on the subject. Eshould like to 00k at the
Korean war from the point of view not of how
we might have done better or worse but of what
we did accom lish. First I think we must recog-
nize that, while North Korea is still held subject
to a foreign tyranny that prevents the reunion of
the Korean peoples, East Germany is also under
a foreign tyrann that prevents the reunion of
the German peop es. The Baltic States, Czecho-
slovakia, Hungary, Rumania, Bulgaria, and Al-
bania have also been brou ht by military force
under a foreign tyranny. gVe cannot, however—
and this is what we must recognize—we cannot
charge our nation with the responsibility for re-
dressing every wrong under which mankind suf-
fers. We cannot consider ourselves morally obli-
gated to liberate by force of arms all those peoples
who have had their independence taken from them.
The restoration of the independence of those who
have lost it remains the constant concern of the
United States Government. That does not mean,
however, that we are impelled to achieve this ob-
jective by war.
For one thing, we have only one-thirteenth of
the population of the world and there are limits
to what we can do with this small number. More-
over, we could not expect, even if we wished to
lead any substantial number of the other twe ve-
thirteenths in a military campaign against all the
oppressive and tyrannical governments in the
world. Most of those other peo les, almost all
those of Europe and Asia, have a ready been put
at least once in their lifetimes through the mangle
of war. They recognize only too well that any
cure of mankind’s ills requiring a major war would
be worse than the disease. The cost in human lives
and suffering of liberating by force all the coun-
tries now held captive under Communist imperial-
ism—even if we could accomplish it singlehand-
edl , which we could not—would be so fearful that
not ing could justify it.
So much for the negative side. On the positive
side I should like to point to the kind of victory we
won in Korea. For the victory was ver real and,
conceived in terms of the announced 0 jective of
the United Nations, it was a complete victory.
The victory won in Korea, and this is what I be-
lieve the American people generally fail to appreci-
ate—was a victor over a far older enemy of
mankind than the ommunists, an enemy far more
terrible in the number of its victims than even the
tyrannies of the Communist world. The victory
was over aggressive war itself. And that was the
United Nations objective in Korea: to repel the
aggression.
\Ve won this victory without subjecting man-
kind to the horrors of a general war, in which the
paciﬁc states must have suffered scarcely less than
the aggressors. That was what the free nations
had twice before in our generation failed to do.
For their aggression in Korea, the Communists
were made to pay a fearful price in hundreds of
thousands killed and wounded, in the destruction
of vast quantities of their precious trans ortation
and military equipment; in the setbac s to the
Chinese industrialization program; in the wreck-
age that was made of North Korea, which before
the war had been an important economic asset to
the Communists. Because of that, because of the
moral purpose and the military strength we
demonstrated in repelling the aggression in Korea,
the danger of further such Communist attacks has,
I think it is clear, been greatly reduced.
Winning on a Prlnclple
That gain, great as it is, was not our on] gain.
During the last year and a half of the orean
war, when the aggression had been repelled and
the aggressor stood behind the line from which
his attack had been launched, we were ﬁghting
for another rinciple. We were ﬁghting a battle
that would ave been particularly close to the
heart of Thomas Jefferson, whose guiding belief
was that all men are possessed of inherent and
unalienable rights—which, b the way, was how
he expressed it in his origina draft of the Decla-
ration of Independence that was subsequently
altered. The question at issue was whether hu-
man bein s are the chattels of whatever regime
controls t eir country and as such must obey its
every edict, however tyrannical, or are to be recog-
nized as having an ultimate responsibility for
their own destinies. Expressed in terms of its
supreme signiﬁcance, the uestion was whether
the state or the human in ividual is the instru-
ment of God’s will. If the former, then all the
prisoners whom we had taken from the Commu-
nists were subject to return by force to the Com-
munist side as the Communists demanded. If
