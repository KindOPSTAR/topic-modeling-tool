THE ENSLAVEMENT OF RACES
U.S./U.N. press release 1910 dated April 23
Forced labor is an anachronism, yet it still
exists in the 20th century. In its most pervasive
form, it is the life worse than death meted out to
those who dare to doubt a totalitarian govern-
ment; a throwback to slavery of the dark ages
employed by the Communist dictator to mass-
li uidate 0 position.
by in Ens enlightened age do we tolerate it?
Why in this council of the United Nations do
we have to talk about it?
We must talk about it, we must discuss the facts
fairly and frank] . For we have before us the
re ort of the Ad 00 Committee.2
e recall that only 4 months ago, in December
1953, the General Assembly aroused by the ﬁnd-
ings in that re ort, expressed its strong condemna-
tion of force labor as a direct contravention of
the solemn obligations of the Charter of the United
Nations.a This action of the General Assembly
was almost unanimous for there were only 5 votes
against it—by those representing the so-called
“workers’ paradises” romised by Lenin.
The ideals and un ertakings of that Charter
have been well served by the Committee’s work.
Its report is regarded almost universally as a
landmark in the history of man’s struggle for
freedom from oppression.
The three outstanding 'urists who comprised
the Committee have earned the abiding atitude
of the members of the United Nations. ikewise
the Secretariat of the United Nations, the Inter-
national Labor Organization, and the nongovern-
mental organizations which participated are
deserving of our fullest thanks.
The cause of freedom was also well served by
the willing contributions of many governments.
‘ Made in the Economic and Social Council on Apr. 23
and 27.

Outside the Soviet world, the charges have been
reviewed seriously. Governments have given full
cooperation in the presentation of laws, data, and
facts. There have been indications that govern-
ments have reviewed their own practices during
the course of the Committee’s investigation. The
facts which underlay the Committee’s inquiries
were of ave concern to the governments in-
volved. They challenged their consciences and
their moral obligations to their own people and
the co 1e of the world.
Nged ess to say, we are concerned about practices
of forced labor wherever they may exist. We are
interested in vigorous action by governments and
cooperative action which can follow after con-
sideration of the Committee’s recommendations.
In this my Government is prepared to participate
within this Council and W1th1n the International
Labor Organization.
Refusal: To Cooperate Wlth Commlttee
It is highly signiﬁcant—and yet understand-
able—that the Committee’s blackest ﬁndings
related to the very countries which refused to
coo erate with the Committee in any way.
e utter disre ard and contempt for the stand-
ards of human ignity and freedom which the
United Nations re resents is clearly shown by the
replies of Czechos ovakia and the U.S.S.R. to the
Committee’s inquiries. That contempt is further
evidenced by their continued refusal to cooperate
even after the General Assembly had requested
such cooperation in its resolution of December 7,
1953. Some 6 weeks later, on January 22, 1954,
the delegation of the U.S.S.R. notiﬁed the Secre-
tary-General that it would continue to refuse to
cooperate, and a ain characterized the report as
“slanderous” and “ rovocative.” In succession
the dele ations of t e Polish People’s Republic
and of zechoslovakia followed sult on March 1
and 10, respectively.
These latest replies must be interpreted for what
they truly arch-a brazen effort to use the technique
of the “b1glie” in combating a series of established
