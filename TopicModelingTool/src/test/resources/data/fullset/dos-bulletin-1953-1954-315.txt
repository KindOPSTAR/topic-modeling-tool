They recalled the tripartite declaration of May 25. 1950,
afﬁrming the determination of their Governments im-
mediately to take action, within and outside the United
gations, to prevent any violation of frontiers or armistice
nes.
They have therefore Jointly requested an urgent meet-
ing of the Security Council to consider the tension between
Israel and the neighboring Arab States, with particular
reference to recent acts of violence and to compliance with
and enforcement of the general armistice agreements.
Two days later, in an address before the New
York Herald-Tribune Forum on October 20, Sec-
retary Dulles noted the action taken and, recallin
that the United States had “played an essentia
part in creatin the State of Israel,” declared that
this was clear y an occasion to invoke the concept
of decent respect for the opinion of mankind as
represented b the United Nations.” ‘2 The Jordan
Government ad already appealed to the Securit
Council on October 16, noting that the Mixe
Armistice Commission had condemned the attack
and had called on Israel to take immediate steps
to revent a recurrence.“
ut there were now other as cts of the problem.
On October 20 Secretary Du] es announced at his
grass conference that the United States, since
eptember 25, had been withholdin an allocation
of Mutual Security funds to Israel ecause Israel
was acting in deﬁance of the United Nations by
tryin to divert water from the Jordan; he de-
clare that this decision was not based on acts such
as the attack on Qibiya. Mr. Dulles indicated that
the action taken would not affect technical co-
operation funds and stated that of some $33 mil-
lion in military assistance, set aside for the coun-
tries of the Near East, no allocations had yet been
made. On October 23 Mr. Dulles ex lained that
assistance to Israel had been deferre —“
because it seemed to us that the State of Israel should
respect General Bennlke's decision, and that as long as the
State of Israel was acting in deﬁance of that decision, it
was questionable at least as to whether we should make
the allocation. I might add we recognize that there was
a right of appeal from General Bennike's decision to the
Security Council, but we felt that pending the exercise of
that appeal it would have been better that the work be
suspended unless Genera] Beunike agreed that it could
go on without prejudice to the interests which he thought
were jeopardized on the part of Syria.
On October 27, however, Ambassador Abba
Eban announced in the Security Council that Is-
rael was agreeing to a temporary suspension of
work in the demilitarized zone.‘5 The next day,
October 28, Secretary Dulles recommended to
President Eisenhower that a grant of $26,250,000

in economic aid to Israel be made for the ﬁrst 6
months of the current ﬁscal ear, on the ground
that the policy of the United tates to support the
United Nations Truce Supervision Organization
in this matter had been realized “and the impedi-
ment to the present grant of economic aid to
Israel” had been removed.“ _
By this time the Security Council was giving
serious consideration both to the Qibiya incident
and to the problem of the Israel-Syrian Demili-
tarized Zone. General Bennike presented a,
thorough report on the Qibiya incident to the
Securit Council on October 27, together with
detaile written responses to questions, which
were submitted formall on November 3, 1953.
The Bennike report estimated that between 250
and 300 well-trained Israel soldiers carried out
this operation with small arms, automatics, in-
cendiary and demolition bombs, and Bangalore
torpedoes, among other types of equipment. His
statements made it clear that, although the Qibiya
incident was not to be isolated from others in
which both Israelis and Jordanians had been in-
volved in the past, nevertheless, because of the
size of the forces employed and the loss of life
and damage involved, it was of outstanding and
major signiﬁcance. Up to the middle of October,
the Mixed Armistice Commission had found Israel
ilty of 21 violations of the Armistice Agreement
giliring 1953, and Jordan of 20 violations. Israel
and Jordan representatives had submitted ﬁgures
to the Armistice Commission to the effect that some
108 Israelis had been killed and 108 wounded, with
243 Jordanians killed and 147 wounded since 1949;
the Commission, however, was able to verify only
31 Israelis killed and 31 wounded, and 79 J ordan-
ians killed and 59 wounded, between 1949 and mid-
October 1953.‘1
There appeared to be little question as to the
facts in the case, despite the Israel Government’s
denial on October '19 that Israel armed forces had
taken part in the raid. Discussion in the Security
Council got under way on November 9.‘8 Ambas-
sador Eban reviewed the problem on November 12,
