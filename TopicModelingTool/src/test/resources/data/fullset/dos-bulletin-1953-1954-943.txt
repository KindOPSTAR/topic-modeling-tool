It is of the utmost concern to my country, and
indeed to peo les everywhere, that France should
continue to p a her historic role as the champion
of liberty, equa ity, and fraternity, and as a master
craftsman of new and better human relationshi )S.
The United States hopes to see realized, while
the op ortunit still emsts, the imaginative and
epocha F rencli concept for blending national
military forces on the continent of Europe so that
they Wlll erform a single service of peace and
security. Iwant to assure you that the pled e of
support embodied in my message of A ril 1 1 to
Monsieur Laniel still stands, and wil continue
available to his successor.
In Indochina our nation has long shown its dee
concern by heavy ﬁnancial and material aid whic
continues. The proposals for a united defense
which we submitted to Monsieur Laniel re re-
sented on our part a momentous and grave eci-
sion. Nothing has ha pened here to change the
attitude thus expresse , even though the lapse of
time and the events which have come to pass have,
of course, created a new situation. But I assure
you that we shall be read in the same 5 irit to
0 en new discussions as the forthcoming rench
overnment may deem it opportune.
I have mentioned two aspects of our relations
which imperatively demand high governmental
attention. You can be sure that they will be dealt
with upon the foundation of the respect and af-
fection for France which is felt by many millions
of individual American citizens. Our past asso-
ciations have brought sorrows and joys which
have indelibly pressed their image upon the very
heart of our nations and this is, on our side, a
guarantee of our future attitude.
I shall be talking informally with Sir Winston
Churchill and Mr. Eden next week and I look for-
ward to resuming with the Government of France
such intimate conversations as I have had in the
past both as President and previously when I
served in Europe in our common cause ﬁrst of
liberation from one tyranny and then of defense
against another tyranny.
I extend to you, my dear Mr. President, my re-
spectful greetings.
