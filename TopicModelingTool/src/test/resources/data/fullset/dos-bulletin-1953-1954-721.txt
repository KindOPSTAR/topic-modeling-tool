individual liberty and the rule of law. The means
of defense of its members have been pooled to
provide collectively the security which they can-
not attain individually, in the face of the military
preponderance which the Soviet Union has at-
tained in Europe since 1945 and of the westward
expansion of a political, economic and military
system subject to its sole control. The North
Atlantic Treaty Organization is wholly defensive.
There is free and full exchange of information
between all its members. All its decisions are
taken by unanimous consent. The Soviet Union
as a member of the organization would therefore
be in a osition to veto every decision. None of
the mem er states is repared to allow their joint
defense system to be disrupted in this way.
European and world security will not be pro-
moted by the disruption of defensive associations
of like-minded states and the substitution of new
illusory security organizations. The United
States Government remains convinced that the
only way to remove the sense of insecurity which
weighs on the world is through step-by-ste solu-
tions of individual problems. It does not elieve
that a lastin settlement can be achieved by erect-
ing a new acade of Security behind which the
fundamental difﬁculties and divisions remain
unchanged.
With these thou hts in mind, the Western
Powers at Berlin a vocated a plan which would
have constituted a ﬁrst step towards the solution
of the German problem.2 The Soviet Govern-
ment would not even discuss this plan. The
Western Powers also put forward proposals
designed to reinforce the security of Euro e on
the basis of existing agreements. The oviet
Government refused also to consider these pro-
posals. The Western Powers offered to acce t
the Soviet text of every unagreed article of t e
Austrian State Treaty. But the Soviet Govern-
ment far from agreeing to sign on its own terms,
attached new and unacceptable conditions which
would have totally changed the treaty from one
of freedom and independence to one of indeﬁnite
occupation by foreign troops.
The Soviet Government has repeated the criti-
cisms it made at Berlin about plans for a European
Defense Community. The United States Govern-
ment has already stated its views on this subject.
It is quite untrue to suggest that the present plans
which are of limited scope are responsible for the
division of Europe or aggravate the risk of war.
The division of Europe was brought about by the
Soviet Government, and its refusal to contem-
plate the reuniﬁcation of Germany on the basis of
free elections is one of the elements that serves to
perpetuate this division. In these circumstances
the Federal Republic of Germany cannot be al-
lowed to remain without any means of defense
when the Eastern Zone of Germany, as its leaders
openly acknowledge, possesses substantial armed
forces. The United States Government considers
that the best and safest way for all concerned to
solve the problem of a German contribution to
defense is within the framework of an association
which b its very nature would prevent Germany
from ta ing any individual armed action.
The United States Government remains con-
vinced of the urgent need to improve relations
between states and to ensure mutual security. It
suggests that progress could best be made toward
the elimination of the sources of international
tension if the Soviet Government would give con-
crete evidence of its good intentions by 'oinin
with the Governments of France, the nite
Kingdom and the United States in (1) ﬁndin a
speedy settlement of the Austrian question t at
will restore to Austria its full soverei ty and
independence; 2) seeking a lasting andgiiccepta-
ble solution of t e German problem; (3) reachin
early agreement on general, progressive, balance ,
and supervised disarmament: such a cement
should speciﬁcally include the rohibition of
atomic and other weapons of mass dbstruction and
the control of atomic energy under adequate safe-
guard; (4) working for solutions of the most
pressing problems in the Far East at the Geneva
conference; (5) conforming their behavior in the
United Nations to the princi les of the Charter
and so enabling the United ations to fulﬁll its
true role as an effective organization for collective
security.
TEXT OF SOVIET NOTE OF MARCH 31
'Ibi'd., Feb. 8, 1954, p. 186.
The Soviet Government ﬁnds it necessary to call the
attention of the United States Government to the
following:
The Soviet Union has consistently pursued a policy of
peace and of improving relations between countries.
This is reﬂected in the proposals which the Soviet Gov-
ernment has put before the United Nations for a general
arms reduction and for the prohibition of atomic and other
weapons of wholesale annihilation.‘
If the proposal of a general arms reduction and the
prohibition of atomic and other of the most dangerous
weapons of wholesale annihilation were adjusted, the
heavy burden the people carry now owing to the continued
arms drive would be greatly eased, and the danger that
such major scientiﬁc discoveries as the discovery of ways
01' employing atomic energy might be used for destructive
purposes would be eliminated.
The solution of this problem would be highly signiﬁcant
in promoting peace and the security of the peoples.
Up to now, as is known, it has not been possible to obtain
the proper international agreements on the afore
mentioned important issues because of the diﬂiculties en-
countered.
This circumstance. however, should not detract from the
signiﬁcance of the efforts. especially on the part of the big
powers, which bear a particular responsibility for the
