German Government Furnishes
Hospital for Korea
Press release 65 dated February 12
Under the terms of an agreement signed at the
Department of State on February 12 a German
Re Cross hospital will shortly become part of the
U. N. Command medical complement and join in
the humanitarian task of caring for the sick and
wounded in war-torn Korea. Acting Secreta
IValter Bedell Smith and Ambassador Heinz .
Krekeler, Chargé d’Aﬂ'aires of the Federal Re-
ublic of Germany, signed the agreement provid-
ing for the establishment of a hos ital whose fa-
cilities will be made available for t e treatment of
civilians and military personnel.
Dr. Konrad Adenauer, Chancellor and Minister
of Foreign Affairs of the Federal Republic of
Germany, offered the hospital to President Eisen-
hower in April 1953 during his visit to Washing-
ton. The President, acting for the U. S. Govern-
ment in its capacity as the Uniﬁed Command in
Korea pursuant to the U. N. resolution of July 7,
1950,1 accepted the offer of the hospital.
The offer of the hospital unit by the Federal Re-
public of Germany is gratifying to the U. S. Gov-
ernment. Unfortunately, the Federal Republic of
Germany is not a member of the United Nations.
Nevertheless, by roviding a Red Cross hospital,
the Federal Repu lie of Germany has once again
'ven expression to its belief in and support for
sic high ideals of the United Nations. This fur-
ther evidence of solidarity with the objectives and
princi les of the international organization and
with t e efforts of the United Nations to rehabili-
tate Korea brings the German people in a closer
bond with the people of the United States and of
the free world. The additional medical services of
the German Red Cross unit will ﬁll a great and
continuing need to restore the health and spirit
of thousands of innocent victims of Communist
a gression in Korea. The U. S. Government
wioleheartedly supports the efforts of the Federal
Republic of Germany in this signiﬁcant humani-
tar] an endeavor.
The hospital staff comprises some 80 civilian
doctors, nurses, and technicians recruited in Ger-
many by the German Red Cross, 9. reco ized na-
tional aid society of the Federal Repu iic. Part
of the staff has already arrived in Korea, and the
full complement, to ether with hos ital unit, is
expected to be in I orea b mid-Fe ruary. The
hospital will have an initia capacity of 200 beds;
its eventual planned ca acity is 400. The sup-
plies, services, and any a ditional eiuipment need-
ed for its operation, which it is not easible for the
Federal Republic to provide, will be furnished b
the United States. The Federal Republic wi
reimburse the United States for the cost of the
assistance furnished to the hos ital.
