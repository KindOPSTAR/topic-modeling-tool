The Influence of Business on American Freedom
Following are the texts of remarks made by
President Eisenhower and Secretary Dulles be-
fore the Board of Trustees of the Committee for
Economic Development at Washington on May 20.
REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT
White House press release dated May 20
I should like to mention a few things that I
think are associated with your work. First, I
believe that in such a group as this lies a reat
part of the major decisions—power for ma 'ng
these major decisions—that are goin to determine
the character of our future, not on y immediate,
but over a longer period.
Many of those decisions are business decisions.
It is a matter of great gratiﬁcation, not only to me
but to every associate I have in the administration,
both on the legislative and executive side, that the
decisions you have been makin reflect an op-
timism and a conﬁdence that we elieve is one of
the greatest factors necessar to ensure that Amer-
ica will continue to march orward as it has been
marching.
Your expenditures for capital investment, plant
improvement, and greater productivity are the de-
cisions of very courageous and forward-looking
people—the same kind of people that have brought
America to its position today.
Now, of course, in their sum, all of the things
that government does affects all of you far more,
possibly, than they did in a simpler day. When
I look over the list today and see great public
works programs in buildings and roads, great ex-
penditures for defense equipment, farm programs,
great extensions in the security programs, old-age
pensions, and all of this sort of thing, I am really
staggered by the sum total that is poured into our
economy, in a direct way, by the Government.
Nevertheless, that is still not the important part.
It is the wisdom, the forward-looking capacities
of our businessmen that are going to make Amer-
ica, and keep America, the healthy, economic or-
ganism that will bring the happiness and progress
to our people.
Along with it I want to suggest only one thing
where I believe the government, with you, has a
mission. That is the constant teaching that the
roblem on the economic development of the
nited States is more than mere economics; it is
of the heart; it is the spirit; it is made up of
such factors as courage, conﬁdence, pride, and
patriotism—faith.
We do not keep security establishments merely
to defend property or territory or rights abroad
or at sea. We keep the security forces to defend
a way of life.
Now everybody knows that no security force is
any ood at all unless it is one of high morale,
belief, and conviction. Consequently, the ﬁrst
thing we must do, it seems to me, is to believe in
this system of freedom with all our hearts, to
realize we are defending, ﬁrst of all, our great
system of freedoms and of rights. Everythin we
do that seems to impinge upon them, althoug at
times we may think it is necessar in their modiﬁ-
cation, we must examine carefu ly and say how
far may we go and still not ruin this system.
\Vhere do we establish the line beyond which we
must not step], unless we are going to go and lose
internally w at we so desperately try to defend
against externally?
I believe we must in this manner of faith recog-
nize a relationship between free government and
a religious faith. I believe that if there is no
religious faith whatsoever, then there is little
defense you can make of a free 5 'stem. If men
are only animals, why not try to ominate them?
We reject these theories that are so earnestly
promulgated b the totalitarian dictatorshi 8.
They have to believe or teach those things in or er
to get people to accept their domination.
\Ve don’t believe them.
That is the kind of thing that I believe govern-
ment can stand for and preach, along with you, as
you try in a material way to bring greater op or-
tunit to all men—for jobs, for raising t eir
stan ards of living. \Ve must constantly remem-
ber that men do not live by bread alone. And the
government and every leader of a business or pro-
