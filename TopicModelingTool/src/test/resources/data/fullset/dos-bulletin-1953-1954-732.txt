I do not mean to sug est that price increases are
not sometimes inevita le. A government, how-
ever, can increase or decrease the su pl of its
money, thereby inﬂuencin its value. Tnﬁyation is
a device that is always an erous, especially if
used often. Conﬁdence in t e overnment may
be lost. It may not be able to se 1 its bonds at an
advantageous price. People lose the incentive to
save, for the real value of their savings may
diminish sharply. Capital available for roduc-
tive investment simply is not accumulated? Cur-
rency ma ﬂow abroad rather than be invested at
home, an such funds as are ke t at home may be
literally driven into the groun —invested in real
estate or other tangible assets because people
mistrust the currency and are afraid to accept an
obligation expressed in monetary terms.
These, then, are some of the principles for which
our government stands in the economic ﬁeld. As
I have said, they are reﬂections of our conviction
that private enterprise and private capital are
the wellsprings of economic strength and stability.
Need for e Long-Term Policy
There is a great need today for us and the other
American Republics to develop long-term eco-
nomic policies and, to the extent that they are
consistent with each other, integrate them for our
common advantage.
The ﬁrst and most obvious beneﬁt is of course
the fact that such policies facilitate both private
and government planning. Most private and
many 1public industrial programs are ﬁnanced
throug the placement of long-term securities.
Such securities enjoy only a limited market unless
investors have reasonable assurance that basic
government policies prevailing at the time of issu-
ance will remain essentially unchanged through-
out the ]ife of the security.
During the war years economic policies both in
the United States and abroad were necessarily
formulated under emergency conditions and were
subject to sudden and extreme changes. This un-
avoidable circumstance worked great hardships
upon business in all countries. Businessmen, how-
ever, patriotically bore these hardships with a
minimum of complaint.
Despite the dislocations brought about by the
Korean conﬂict and the cold war, conditions are ap-
parently becoming more stable. The vast recon-
struction and aid pro ams necessary to revive
war-torn areas are 0 diminishing importance.
Industry throu bout the free world is approaching
or has exceede rewar levels. Programs for na-
tional defense, w 1ile vastly more burdensome than
before the war, are assuming more or less uniform
annual levels.
\Ve can and therefore should seek to establish
lon -term economic policies.
t is im ortant, too, that the policies we adopt
be clearly eﬁned and carefully explained to every-
one aﬂ’ected. In Latin America there is some justi-
ﬁable confusion as to 'ust what our economic oli-
cies in that area may e. The effect abroad 0 the
confusion to which I have referred was apparent
at Caracas.
Latin Americans are realistic thinkers. They
plan in terms of what can be accomplished and
not in terms of what might theoretically be desir-
able. If in the course of developin their own
plans and policies they have before t em a clear
statement of our own policies, then, insofar as
their planning involves us, it will be adjusted to
those olicies in a very logical manner. If, on
the other hand, our own position is not known,
then, and inevitably, olicies, resolutions, and pro-
osals are advanced) on matters affecting the
nited States, and in which we cannot particlpate.
The resulting disa pointment and feeling of
frustration needless y strains our international
relations.
Therefore, if this is a propitious time for the
development of long-term economic policies and if
we are to have an opportunit at Rio to identi
and agree upon those parts 0 our economic 11-
cies that prove generally advantageous, t en,
surely, one of our most constructive moves would
be to announce our own convictions on the subject
as far as possible in advance of Rio. This will
permit the Latin American economists to think
1n terms of what is practically achievable insofar
as their plans and rograms relate to anticipated
action on the part ofthe United States. lVe would
hope that the Governments of our sister republics
might follow a similar course.
Another obvious advantage of having a reason-
ably clear foreign economic policy 15 that it
greatly sim liﬁes our own task of meeting and
isposing 0 problems arising in this ﬁeld.
Posltlve Features of Our Inter-Amerlcan
Economlc Pollcy
Now let us consider what progress has been
made thus far by the Latin American Republics in
establishing their economies upon a sound basis,
the form which United States assistance has taken
in the past, and the contribution which we may be
prepared to make in the future.
The rate of industrial progress in Latin America
in the postwar period has been little short of
phenomenal, even after adjustment of gross pro-
duction ﬁgures to a er-capita basis and with
adjustment for price 0 anges. Population is in-
creasing in Latin America at a rate of 2 to 2.5 per-
cent per year—more rapidly than in most other
areas of the world.
Output of goods and services has been increas-
ing even faster. The per-capita rate of increase
since the war has been 3.5 percent er year. Not
all of this has one into increasedp consumption.
standar s have been raised a preciably.
