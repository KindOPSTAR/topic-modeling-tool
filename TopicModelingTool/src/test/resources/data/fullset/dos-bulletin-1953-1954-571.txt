a limitation on the number of immigrants to the
United States I am discussing these basic con-
cepts not only because they have remained un-
changed but also because they relate to American
iM1 ation policy, which is the responsibility of
the ngress of the United States. will discuss
with you changes the new law has brought about
and which have become most obvious to us in the
Visa Ofﬁce of the Department of State during
these last 15 months.
One of the most troublesome roblems consular
ofﬁcers in the ﬁeld and we in t e Department of
State had to deal with before the new law became
effective was that of an American citizen who had
married a woman of Asian ancestry and discov-
ered only too late that under our laws then in
existence he had only the choice between his coun-
try and his wife since our laws, with few excep-
tions, then did not ermit the immigration of
persons of Asian stoc .
One of the most important changes the new law
has brought about is the elimination of race as a
bar to immigration. Alien wives and husbands of
American citizens and alien children of American
citizens are now eligible for immigration and en-
titled to nonquota status irrespective of their race.
While it is true that the quotas accorded to Asian
peoples are minimum quotas, it must be borne in
mind that the volume 0 immigration from a given
area is composed of both quota and nonquota im-
migrants and the latter group of course ma ex-
ceed without limit the numerical limitations p aced
on quota immigrants. This is best illustrated b
the fact that during the last ﬁscal year 1,043 Chl-
nese and 2,489 Japanese came to the United States
as immigrants, although Japan has a quota of only
185 and only 105 uota numbers are available to
Chinese ersons. n evaluating these data it must
be recallgd that racial bars to immigration were
not lowered until the second half of the 1953 ﬁscal
year.
Changes In Quota Chargcablllty
Another important change which the new law
has brought about is a general relaxation of the
method by which the quota chargeability of an
alien is determined. The basic rule remains un-
changed that the quota of an alien is determined
by his place of birth. While formerly only an
alien wife chargeable to an oversubscribed quota
could be charged to the more favorable quota of
her accompanying husband, under the new law a
husband as well as a wife may be charged to the
more favorable quota of the accompanying spouse.
For example, the Greek husband of an English
woman may be charged to the quota of Great
Britain.
Similarly, a child may now be charged to his
own quote, the quota of his accompanying father
or mother, whichever of the three is most favor-
able. In the past a child mandatorin had to be
charged to the quota of the accompanying father.
This relaxation of the law which may seem unim-
portant, I assure you, has brought relief to many
an immigrant family b giving them an opportu-
nity to come to the United States together rather
than choosing between separation or waiting to-
gether abroa .
Another chan e relating to the quota charge-
abilit has broug t relief for many hardship cases
for w ich there was no satisfactory solution under
the old law. In a considerable number of cases
proslpective immigrants born in countries with
sma and oversubscribed quotas had to be given
the discouraging information that the had to an-
ticipate an indeﬁnite waitin erio under the
quota of their country of birth a though they had
no tie to the country of their birth.
The typical example is that of an alien born in
India. while his British arents were stationed
there as missionaries or t at of a Swiss erson
born in Egypt whose father was statione there
as a consu ar ofﬁcer of his country. The law now
permits that an alien who was born in a country
1n which neither of his parents was born and in
which neither of his arents had a residence at the
time of such alien’s irth may be charged to the
quota of either arent. In other words to use our
examples, the a ien born in India may be charged
to the British quota to which his parents would
have been chargeable, and the alien who was born
as son of the Swiss Consul in Egypt may be
charged to the quota of Switzerland.
Fuller use of existing quotas is made possible
under the new law by permitting that any ortion
of a given quota. not used during the rst 10
months of a quota. year may be used without
numerical limitation during May and June, that
is, the last 2 months of the quota year. The
restriction on the use of quotas to 10 percent of
each quota per month which now is applicable
only during the ﬁrst 10 months applied to every
month of the quota year under the old law. Thus,
quota numbers were lost if a demand for immigra-
tion visas in excess of 20 percent developed in
May and June of a year under a quota which had
not been utilized up to 80 percent during the ﬁrst
10 months of the same quota year.
The prohibition against the immigration of
manual labor, the so-called “contract labor pro-
vision” of the old law, by and large restricted im-
migration to the United States to relatives and
close friends of American citizens and of perma-
nent resident aliens. Aliens with good skills and
many of them needed in this country but lacking
family or friendship ties as a rule could not come
to this country as they were unable to secure an
acceptable afﬁdavit of support as evidence that
they were not likely to become public charges.
Thus real “new-seed immigration” had become
unknown in this country except for those immi-
