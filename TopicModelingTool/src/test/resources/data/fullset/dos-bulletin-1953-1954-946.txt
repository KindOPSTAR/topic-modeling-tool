Director’s Statement
Former American Ambassador Hugh Gibson,
Director of the Migration Committee, made a
challenging statement to the government members
at the o ening meeting of the session. Citing the
low v0 ume of movement, 77,626 in 1952 and
87,501 in 1953, he pointed out that a gradual in-
crease in movement had taken lace since July
1953 and that 40,328 persons hadp been assisted to
ﬁnd new homes overseas by the Committee in the
ﬁrst 4 months of 1954, clearly indicating a total
movement for the year under the Committee’s
aus ices of approximately 120,000.
he operations of the Committee in the ﬁrst 2
years had taken place during a period of low
worldwide migration when immigration countries
for economic and political reasons had reduced
their intake of immigrants. The Committee
therefore found itself under the necessity of de-
veloping and encouraging new bilateral arrange-
ments etween governments to reestablish the
higher ﬂow of migrants that had taken place with
international assistance durin the eriod from
1947 to 1951. Mr. Gibson state thatt e increased
rate of movement already noted in recent months
had resulted not only from the action of govern-
ments in increasing their intake but largely from
special services provided by the Committee. The
Committee, he said, had assisted governments, at
their request, to improve their emigration and im-
migration procedures and had supplied special
services in the way of vocational and language
training and information to migrants concerning
immigration opportunities. A large part of the
increased movement had resulted, he stated, from
the Committee’s recent efforts in Italy and Greece,
particularly to assist the reunion of families of
migrants who had gone in earlier years to
Australia, Argentina, and Brazil.
Mr. Gibson estimated that the present move-
ment of migrants assisted by the Committee con-
