world economic aﬁ'airs, each of the 18 representa-
tives of Eoosoo has an opportunity to express the
views of his country and of his region, to expound
his approach to economic problems and to offer
his solution for these roblems. It is in this en-
eral review of economic matters that the con ict-
ing philoso hies of the free world and the Com-
munist wor d emerge most sharply. It is here that
the United States representatives have an oppor-
tunity to explain the American way of life and to
expose the alse charges made against us by the
Soviet bloc spokesmen.
I want now to review one of the most important
highlights of the recent Ecosoc meeting at the
United Nations Headquarters in New York. My
purpose is to show how the United Nations serves
our interests in the economic ﬁeld.
Stlmulatlng Private Investment
This session again took up what has become one
of the most controversial subjects in the United
Nations. This is the roblem of the international
ﬂow of private capita for the economic betterment
of underdeveloped countries. This involves the
question of how best to stimulate economic devel-
opment in the vast areas of the world that need
capital—through overnment loans, such as
gamed by the nited States Export-1m ort
ank; through international public loans, suc as
granted by the World Bank; through private for-
eign investment; or through development of local
sources of rivate capital. All of these methods
have proved useful in the past. They are making
their contribution today. But the pressure for
governmental and intergovernmental loans and
grants-in-aid continues to mount in the United
Nations.
The United States in the Economic and Social
Council has been giving increasing emphasis to
the need for stimulating the ﬂow of private invest-
ment into the underdeveloped countries. At the
recent session of the Council, our representative,
Mr. Preston Hotchkis, eﬂ'ectively presented the
American view that much needs to be done, and
can be done, to develop new sources of both foreign
and local private capital.2 This view was ac-
cepted by the Council by an overwhelming vote
of 15 to 2. Only the Soviet Union and Czecho-
slovakia opposed.
I would like to read one key paragraph of this
resolution:a
The Economic and Social Council
Recommends continuing efforts by countries seeking
to attract private foreign capital to:
Re-examlne, wherever necessary, domestic policies, legis-
lation and administrative practices with a view to im-
proving the investment climate; avoid unduly burden-
some taxation; avoid discrimination against foreign in-

vestments; facilitate the import by investors of capital
goods, machinery and component materials needed for
new investment; make adequate provision for the remis-
sion of earnings and repatriation of capital.
The resolution also recommends other measures
which the underdeveloped countries might adopt
for attracting private foreign capital. It makes
a number of very useful recommendations to the
capital-exporting countries. Among other things,
the resolution recommends that the capital-export-
ing and capital-importing countries negotiate
treaties on double taxation as well as agreements,
if consistent with national laws, providing for the
insurability of certain nonbusiness risks. This
resolution is a forthright reco ition by the
United Nations of the princip es of private
investment.
I have given you an example of Ecosoo action
in the economic ﬁeld—one which represents a
notable achievement for the American viewpoint.
We are also advancin our economic interests
through the specialize agencies of the United
Nations. I would now like to review for you a
few signiﬁcant developments in this ﬁeld.
Work of the Speclallzed Agenclcs
Article 55 of the charter calls upon member
states to take joint and separate action to promote
higher standards of living and conditions of eco-
nomic and social rogress. Your Government has
taken seriously these charter obligations and has
given leadership to the splecialized agencies estab-
lishid under the United ations to carry out this
wor .
We undertook these commitments in the knowl—
edge that in this interdependent world in which
We live, our eneral well-being is intimatel bound
with the we l-bein of other countries. he con-
tinued existence 0% very low living standards in
large areas of the world is unhealthy. The exist-
ence of vast de ressed areas is a heavy drag upon
the whole worl econom . The American people,
who have experienced t e beneﬁts of a VlgOl‘OllS
and prosperous economy, have a real stake in seeing
that the commitments under the charter to take
joint and se arate action in the economic ﬁeld are
1mplemente . We have a real stake in the devel-
opment of vigorous and prosperous economies
a road. We are not interested 1n exploiting any-
one. We are interested in the mutual advantages
which ﬂow from an unfettered exchange of skills,
goods, and ideas with other people. This is neither
altruism nor imperialism—it is simply enlightened
self-interest.
We cannot relax our efforts to assist the under-
developed countries to help themselves and to
improve their economic conditions. It is one of
our best and our most effective answers to the Com-
munist drive for the minds and hearts of men. The
specialized agencies have already done some strik-
ing things with agricultural, technological, and
