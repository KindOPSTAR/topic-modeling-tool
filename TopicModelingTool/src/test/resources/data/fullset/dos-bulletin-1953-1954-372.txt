The strength of the ethnic groups during the
riod of neutrality and of war is an index of the
emographic com lex of the country. In the
postwar years, w en appeals were broadened
worldwide, and often from needy people without
blood-tie support, the strength 0 the religious
grou s was eatly increase , equal to 70 percent
of al contri utions in this eriod. This expan-
sion reﬂects the realistic app ication of the hilos-
ophy of humanitarianism, the relief to a with-
out discrimination.
Collectively the voluntary contributions
equaled almost 93 rcent of the total resources
provided for relie and rehabilitation over the
14 years of agency operations. Yet these contribu-
tions did not wholly measure the support the
voluntary agencies received. There were quali—
tative as well as quantitative values. There must
be considered the voluntary committees, and the
other services of thousands of public-spirited men
and women, and the impressive help donated by
the Advertising Council of America through the
press, radio, and television.
The direct person-to-person, and the people-to-
people, impact did much to further mutual under-
standing. In the words of the congressional re-
port already referred to, the foreign recipient of
American voluntary aid “knows that the assist-
ance he receives is based upon the personal re-
nse of some individual American to his needs.”
e participation of the American donor directly,
as well as indirectly through his taxes, gave him
a sense of personal responsi ilit , and furthered a
constructive interest in world a airs.
This is as it should be. An imbalance of ma-
terial support from ofﬁcial sources would have
im aired and might have negated the value of the
vo untary aid as an expresion of the humani-
tarian interest of the American people. Govern-
ment surplus dairy products were an invaluable
complementary asset. They were used by the
registered voluntary agencies, not as a fugitive
resource of ﬂeeting benevolence, but to maintain
the continuity of programs of duration in food-
deﬁcit areas. On the constructive basis already
established the voluntary agencies can continue
to accept substantial amounts of surplus com-
modities, includin ﬁber (cotton) as well as food
with appro riate nancial assistance.
The cone usion of the active war opened up the
countries of Central and Southern Europe—Aus-
tria, Germany, Greece, and Ital —to a greatly
increased ﬂow of relief provided y relatives and
friends and the religious u The economic
im rovcment made possib e by the Marshall lan
in ermany, as well as in the countries of Nort em
and Western Europe permitted, however, an in-
creasing diversion of resources to the countries of
the Near, Middle, and Far East.
