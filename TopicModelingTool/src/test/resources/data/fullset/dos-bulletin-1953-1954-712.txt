through the Vosges Mountains and into the heart
of Southern German and Austria. That mag-
niﬁcent Army never ailed to achieve its objective
and carried out every instruction which was given
to it in a s lendid manner. And, of course, if
those Frenc troops had not been there, we here
in the United States would have had to supply
them ourselves. On their shoulder patch were the
arms of the city of Colmar and the words, “Rhin-
Danube,” and it was in that historic city that Mar-
shal de Lattre decorated me with the Légion
d’Honneur and Croix de Guerre with palm, the
insignia of which I am wearing here today and
which, for the whole of my life, are an honor of
unique signiﬁcance and meaning to me.
Herolsm at DIen-Blen-Phu
And now the world admires the heroism of
French ﬁghting men at Dien-Bien-Phu who stand
squarely in the tradition of their older brothers
at Bir Hacheim and at Colmar and 0f the French
regular army. May God preserve them in safety!
Those days in World War II were very grim
and very difﬁcult even when compared With our
present state of uneasy peace. Because, even
though our present state is distracting and dis-
orderly and often causes us worries and brings
sad losses every day in Indochina, it is nonetheless
true that a state of honorable peace, however
imperfect and even though punctuated with
bloody actions like those which took place in
Korea and are now taking place in Indochina, is
better than all-out worldwide war.
In 1944 and 1945, on the other hand, when we
were engaged in an all-out war, the United States
Commander, General Devers, gave orders to the
French under his command and Marshal de Lattre
in turn gave orders to a large number of American
troops, and in both cases these orders involved loss
of life. Yet, in spite of this stark reality, our re-
lations were successful. I often think that, if the
Americans and the French could get along as well
together as they did in 1944 and 1945, when our
re ationships involved the actual loss of so much
human life, that there could be no valid reason for
despairing of solving today’s problems, difﬁcult
and comp icated though they are.
The French record since the end of World
War II is as remarkable as its record in its struggle
for liberation. We must never forget that we owe
primarily to Frenchmen credit for the Political
mitiative, vision, and statesmanshi which have
gone into the creation of such novei)and original
olitical and economic concepts as the Euro an
cal and Steel Community, the European De ense
Community, and the European Political Com-
munity.
Yet, in the face of this record in war and peace,
there are those in both countries who allow them-
selves to become unduly distressed by the utter-
ances of individual political ﬁgures in both coun-
tries who do not speak for their own count at
all. What a lack of sound jud cut it is to a low
ourselves to be impressed by t ese unrepresente-
tive and raucous voices! To do so serves only the
Communists—which, of course, is why they call
so much attention to them.
It is from this background, beginning in bo -
hood, oing all throu h m life, and including e
terrib e days of war, t iat am speaking today. It
is a back ound of close association with France
under di cult conditions. It is animated by the
aﬂ'ection one feels for men and w0men with whom
one has been thrown in good weather and in foul,
particularly at those times when the oing was
rough. There is something special an precious
about the affection one feels for persons whose
sufferings one knows and whose courage one ob-
serves and admires. With friends so close, failure
to be frank would be wrong. It is in that spirit
that I speak today—and on matters which affect
both our countries with equal closeness.
It is in that spirit that I admit at the outset how
ve difﬁcult are the issues which France confronts
an how natural and proper it is for France to be
deliberate, to take her time, and to hear all sides of
the question.
The problem of Indochina is agonizing. We not
only salute the brave Frenchmen who have fallen
there; we thoroughly understand the vast impor-
tance of Indochina not only to France but to the
whole free world. The American peo 1e recognize
that the French Union Forces are ﬁ liting a mod-
ern Thermopylae—holding oﬁ' tge barbarian
hordes who seek to im ress free people into
tyranny. The United tates is determined—
working in con'unction with France, with Viet-
Nam, Laos, an Cambodia, and with other free
nations concerned—to help revent the spread of
the Soviet and Chinese Cgmmunist system to
Southeast Asia.
In Euro the momentous decision concerning
the establis ment of a common defense community
is approaching its culmination. The European
Defense Community was proposed by the Govern-
ment of France. I well remember being in Paris
in November 1950 and having Marshal de Lattre
outline to me the broad ideas which later became
the underlying concepts of the European Defense
Community.
This proposal won and continues to hold wide
support in the United States and elsewhere.
U.S.-UM. Support for Defense Communlty
Indeed, within the last week both the United
States and the United Kingdom Governments
have given the most speciﬁc evidence of that sup-
port, in the form of solemn assurances from both
governments that they will continue to maintain
in Europe such armed strength as may be neces-
sary and appropriate to contribute their fair
shares of the forces needed for the joint defense
