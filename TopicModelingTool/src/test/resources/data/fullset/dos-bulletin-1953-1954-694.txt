Within a few years direct employment was given
to 4,000 men and onl 11 of these were from the
United States. Similar examples can be cited
around the world.
I have been told how, in the development of the
tremendous iron ore resources of Venezuela, in
itself a notable achievement, the United States
Steel Corporation is building a 90-mile railroad
from CeI'ro Bolivar to Puerto Ordaz on the Ori-
noco River. The latter river, too, through inten-
sive dred 'ng has become an important artery for
the supp y of raw materials to world markets.
The impact of this single investment in terms of
employment of Venezuelan nationals, the provi-
sion of electrical facilities, housing, schools, and
medical facilities, quite apart from direct con-
tributions to the Venezuelan economy in the form
of taxes, is staggering.
The Firestone Tire and Rubber Com any in-
vestment in Liberia is a classic example 0 foreign
capital investment which has contributed tremen-
dously to the economic strength, political stability,
and social progress of an underdeveloped country.
The Firestone investment in Liberia, estimated at
$60 or $70 million, provides emplo ment for about
15,000 Liberians and is a principa source of reve-
nue for the Liberian Government. The success
of the Firestone venture in Liberia and the good
relations consistently maintained with the Li-
berian Government have encouraged other invest-
ments in Liberia, particularly in mining, and
additional important investments in the future
may be conﬁdently expected.
The immensity of these United States Steel and
Firestone investments should not lead us to over-
look the contribution to economic development of
the hundreds of smaller investments being made
each year. For example, a relatively small invest-
ment, which ma prove important to the country
in which it will7 be made, will follow from the
recent decision of one United States ﬁrm to install
a plant in the tropics for the manufacture and can-
nin of banana puree and banana ﬂakes. The ﬁrst
pro uct will be sold primaril to manufacturers of
baby foods, the second is to used for ﬂavoring
purposes. The investment will make possible the
utilization of much substandard fruit which has
hitherto largely been wasted.
I could go on citing other cases. Many of you
could do ikewise. Some of ou undoubtedly
know better than I the astounding story of the
growth of Sears Roebuck in Latin America, how
new standards of merchandising have been intro-
duced, how scores of new small industries have
been called into being. The examples I have
given illustrate the predominant form of invest-
ment today. It is direct investment in which the
ﬂow of managerial and technical assistance is
often more important than the capital itself. The
so-called capital-exporting countries invest not
only their capital, but also their technicians, their
ideas, and their ideals.
Portfolio investment, as we knew it in the twen-
ties, when large sums were sent abroad, sometimes
rather recklessly, has now pretty much disap-
peared. Today, of course, we have the Interna-
tional Bank and national institutions such as our
Ex ort-Import Bank where capital is combined
wit technical assistance and careful analysis.
These institutions are helping to provide the un-
derdevelo ed countries with basic facilities which
increase t e 0 portunities for diversiﬁed private
investment. hese institutions seek private part-
ners in their lending operations, and, to an increas-
ing degree, are turning for their funds to the
private portfolio markets. The investment cli-
mate abroad is thus of direct importance to the
investments of the public lending agencies. Gov-
ernment lending agencies could conceivably pro-
vide capital in the face of an unfriendly invest-
ment climate, but the supply of such funds is never
likely to be large. Therefore, when we talk about
measures to stimulate the international ﬂow of
capital we are talking about measures to inﬂuence
the individual decis10ns of potential private in-
vestors.
lmpedlmente to Forelgn Investment
Unfortunately, as we all know, these decisions
are adversely affected by several general condi-
tions. The most important of these are the fear of
war and political instability. But, there are other
im ediments more fully within the control of indi-
vi ual governments. These include threats of
nationalization and expropriation, discriininato
treatment of foreign companies, stringent contro s
over the entry and operations of foreign investors,
and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings,
of capital gains, and of capital itself. Removal of
these im ediments is necessary if a satisfactory
climate or foreign investments is to be built.
I do not mean to imply, however, that if these
impediments were removed private investment
would ﬂow automatically in fabulous volume. It
is sometimes assumed that there is a. widespread
interest among business groups in the capital ex-
porting countries in investing abroad, and a strong
esire for overseas outlets or capital. Such an
assumption is open to serious uestion. The
American corporate or individua investor has
ample opportunity to invest his capital within his
own countr , in an environment which he lmows
and in whic he has conﬁdence. Corporate invest-
ment in the United States, for example, has aver-
aged around $33 billion annually during the past
4 years. The American corporation has a large
domestic market close at hand, and its overseas
interests may be conﬁned to production in the
United States for export. When it comes to in-
vesting abroad the corporation is likely to be in-
terested initially in the countries most familiar to
it which may be those which are closest geographi-
cally.
