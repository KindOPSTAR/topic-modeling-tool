First, the Armistice Agreement provisions which
enable the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commis-
sion to supervise the im lementation of the
armistice behind the lines ave been effectively
b passed by the Communists, so that the Neutral
ations Supervisory Commission has been unable
to fulﬁll its proper function in North Korea.
Secondly, at Panmunjom, during the negotia-
tions in which I took (part, the Communists made
proposals which blan ly ignored the clear intent
of paragraph 60 regarding the holding of the po-
litical conference, both with respect to the
composition of the conference and to its agenda.
They had either changed their minds since sign-
ing the agreement or had no intention of adhering
to the terms of paragraph 60 when they si ed it.
A third and even more ﬂagrant case 0 abuse
of the Armistice Agreement was their action re-
lated to the nonrepatriate prisoners of war.
When, in the ﬁrst few days of explanations to the
prisoners of war, it became apparent that only a
small fraction would agree to return to the Com-
munist side, the Communists preferred to block
the whole procedure of explanations and distort
the terms of reference rather than be faced with
daily humiliation.
In all three cases, Pei ing’s written word
meant nothing as soon as it%ecame advanta eous
to violate it. Peiping could hardly have c osen
a better way to demonstrate that it has not
changed its policies since the armistice.
To sum up the mainland situation, we must
estimate that not only will the Peiping regime
maintain effective control of the mainland but it
will remain ﬁrmly alined with Moscow and will
continue to pursue objectives inimical to the
United States and all free nations by any means
at its disposal, including armed aggression when
feasible.
Importance of Formosa
Turning now to Formosa, we ﬁnd that it oc-
cupies an importance in our appraisal of the China
scene greatly out of proportion to its size and re-
sources, because it is the seat of the legitimate
Government of China. Since it was driven from
the mainland by Communist power, the Govern-
ment of the Republic of China has not onl suc-
ceegeld in surviving but has grown in strengt and
st 1 ity. 1
Strategically, the Island of Formosa, defended
by a steadily improving military establishment
ome 172 million strong, is a major obstacle to fur-
her Communist military expansion in the Paciﬁc.
ecause the military forces on Formosa are com-
posed of Chinese imbued with a desire to liberate
their fellow countrymen on the mainland, they
possess, in addition to their intrinsic military
value, a psychological importance for China
greater than a comparable force of another na-
tionality. Thus, while it would be unwise to over-
estimate the strength of the free Chinese forces
on Formosa in the face of the formidable military
ower of the mainland they are nevertheless an
ilpdis ensable asset to free-world defenses in the
am e.
Perhaps of more importance, however, than the
military capabilities of Free China are its politi-
cal potentialities. The very existence of the Gov-
ernment of the Republic of China on Formosa
symbolizes the signiﬁcant fact that communism
has not won a total victory in China. During the
4% years that it has governed from Taipei, im-
portant strides have been made in the economic
and governmental administration spheres, dem-
onstrating that the Chinese Government has a ca-
pacity for growth and improvement, and provid-
1ng conﬁdence that it will continue to develop on
Formosa a free Chinese society which will stand
in increasingly favorable contrast to the regi-
mented and oppressed society of the mainland.
By fulﬁlling this role, it will attract growing sup-
port and allegiance from the Chinese people every-
where.
The Chinese Government on Formosa also pro-
vides the Chinese eople with a representative
voice in the Unit Nations and in other inter-
national forums, and with a channel of continuing
contact with the peoples of the free world. It has
consistently su ported the objectives of the United
Nations and other international bodies to which it
belongs, and thereby has assumed a posture in
world affairs more truly representative of the
desires of the Chinese people than the deﬁant and
aggressive regime in Peipin . In sum, we must
estimate that for the sake 0 the Chinese people,
as well as in our own interest, we must continue
to recognize the Government of the Republic of
China as the rightful Government of China and to
give it our ﬁnancial, diplomatic, and military
sugplort.
e 13 million overseas Chinese are an impor-
tant element of the China picture in their own
right. It should not be forgotten that overseas
Chinese support of Sun Yat-sen contributed sig-
niﬁcantly to the ultimate overthrow of the Manchu
dynasty. Once again the overseas Chinese com-
munities may make an important contribution to
the cause of freedom.
The role of the overseas Chinese is given added
si iﬁcance by the active, and sometimes effective
e orts (particularly in the case of the youth) of
the Chinese Communists to enetrate their com-
munities and to make tools 0 them. In countries
which have recognized the Peiping regime this
effort is facilitated by the inducements and pres-
sures which Peiping can exert on the overseas
Chinese through its diplomatic and consular
oﬂicials.
On balance, however, Peiping has lost ground in
the overseas Chinese communities, at least in terms
of the numbers of its supporters. This may be
attributed in part to the excesses of the regime
