ened that they would not feel that they were “at
the mercy of srael.” “
As for the Israel hydroelectric project in the
Israel-Syrian Demilitarized Zone, the Security
Council was unable to a e on a resolution before
the end of 1953." Durlng the course of the dis-
cussion Ambassador Eban took the sition that
the project was a constructive one. did not injure
Syrian interests in any way, would ﬁt into more
general projects for water utilization, and was
within the framework of the Israel-S rian Armis-
tice A, eement. Ambassador Fari Zeineddine
of S 1a on the other hand, with support from
Sir afrulla Khan and Ambassador Malik, con-
tended that the rights of Syria, both in an eco-
nomic and in a militar sense, were infringed, that
Israel had no “sovereignty” in the demilitarized
zone under the Armistice Agreement, that work
could not be carried on without Syrian a ement,
and that General Bennike’s authority int e matter
should be explicitly upheld. A draft resolution
notin the situation, upholding the authority of
the Chief of Staﬂ', and requesting and authorizing
him “to explore ssibilities of reconcilin the
interests” involve , was presented by the I nited
States, the United Kingdom, and France, on De-
cember 21, 1953. But it was clear that it did not
command a substantial majority and was threat-
ened with a veto on the part of the Soviet repre-
sentative, Andrei Vyshinsky, now ﬁshing in the
troubled waters of the Jordan. Nor was the
Council able to reach a decision later in December
or in January 1954, despite modiﬁcations in the
draft resolution. When the vote came on January
22, there were seven in favor, two against (Leba-
non and the U. S. S. R.), and two abstentions
(Brazil and China), the Soviet representative
having cast his country’s 57th veto."
On the other hand, the General Assembly ap-
proved (52-0—5) a resolution on November 27,
1953, which extended the United Nations Relief
and \Vorks Agency for Palestine Refugees in the
Near East and maintained the projects fund pre-
viously authorized at $200 million, the total pro-

It may he observed that the Soviet representative made
no statement at all concerning the Qibiya incident.
"The discussion as a whole may be followed in U.N.

"On Jan. 28, 1954. the Israel representative requested
urgent consideration by the Security Council of the Israel
complaint against Egypt concerning (a) enforcement by
Egypt of restrictions on the passage of ships trading with
Israel through the Suez Canal: and (h) interference by
Egypt with shipping proceeding to the Israeli port of
Elath on the Gulf of Aqaha, in violation of the Security
Council‘s resolution of Sept. 1, 1951 and of the Egyptian-
Israel General Armistice Agreement of February 24. 1949-

gram being established at $292,800,000. The _Ad-
visory Committee, at the same time, was authorized
to increase its membership by two.” Moreover,
the Conciliation Commission for Palestine was
able to report some progress during 1953 with
respect to the problem of blocked refugees’ ac-
counts in Israel, noting that there had been some
3,200 ap lications, that some 1,590 had been ap-
proved or payment, and estimating that, when
all applications had been processed, t e total value
of payments would amount to about £750,000.“o
Tho Problems of Morocco and Tunlsla
Other diﬂicult problems which came before the
Eighth Session of the General Assembl , and
which involved U.S. relations both with ranoe
and with the States of the Arab world, were those
of Morocco and Tunisia..1 Although the United
States was unable to support the draft resolutions
submitted on these uestions by certain Arab-
Asian states (neither raft obtained the necessary
two-thirds majority in the General Assembly), its
attitude was explained in Committee I.
Thus, on October 13, 1953, Ambassador Lodge
noted that the “aspirations of peoples who are not
now independent toward self-government always
evoke s mpathy and sup ort from Americans,” in
view of, their “basic tra itions.” But he did not
consider that the Moroccan issue was one which
