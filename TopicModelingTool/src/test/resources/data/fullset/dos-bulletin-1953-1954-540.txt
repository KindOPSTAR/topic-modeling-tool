Convictions for Illegal
Export of War Materials
Press release 156 dated March 23
The conviction toda in Federal Court at Balti-
more, Md., of Air nion, Inc., and Henry L.
Kni ht of Bethesda, Md., brings to a successful
conc usion several years of intensive investigation
by the Department of State and the Customs Bu-
reau in Europe, South America, and in the United
States of suspected illegal diversions of war
materials.
George Cochran Doub, the U.S. Attorney in
Baltimore, prosecuted the case as the ﬁrst court
trial of a conspiracy to divert war materials to
Iron Curtain destinations.
Witnesses were brou ht from Europe and South
America to testify at the trial.
It is believed that the determined action taken
against the cons irators in this case will serve as
a deterrent to ot ers who may be tempted to dis-
regard legal prohibitions on the ex ortation of
arms, ammunition, and implements 0 war to Iron
Curtain countries.
