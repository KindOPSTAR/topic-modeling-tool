Indochina
The situation in Indochina continues to be
fraught with great danger, not only to the imme-
diate area but to the security of the United States
and its allies in the Paciﬁc area. You will recall
that we have treaties of mutual security and de-
fense with Australia and New Zealand, and with
the Philippines, which recognize that the area is
one which is vital to the peace and safety of the
United States.
Communist China has been intensifying Com-
munist aggression in French Indochina.
In application of the classic Communist pattern,
they have sought to capitalize on local aspirations
for independence and used them as a pretext for a
major war of a gression. The rulers of Com-
munist China train and equip in China the troops
of their puppet Ho Chi Minh. They supply these
troops wit large amounts of artillery and am-
munition. They su ply military and technical
guidance in the sta section of Ho Chi Minh’s
Command, at the division level and in specialized
units such as the signal and engineering corps,
artillery units, and transportation.
The large purpose is not only to take over Indo-
china but to dominate all of Southeast Asia. The
struggle thus carries a grave threat not only to
Viet-Nam, Laos, and Cambodia, but also to such
friendly neighboring countries as Malaya, Thai-
land, Indonesia, the Philippines, Australla, and
New Zealand.
The United States Government has been alive to
the growing eril. Last September we agreed
with the Frenc Government to help carry out the
Navarre Plan.‘ This is a plan, designed by Gen-
eral Navarre, to break the or anized body of Com-
munist aggression by the end of the 1955 ﬁghting
season and thereby reduce the ﬁghting to guerrilla
warfare which could, in 1956, be met for the most
part by national forces of the three Associated
States. '
The basic elements of this plan were:
Full independence of Viet-Nam, Laos, and Cam-
bodia, within the French Union, so that their
peoples would have a clear stake in the stru gle;
Building up the national forces of Viet-Sam,
Laos, and Cambodia; and
Some initial addition of armed strength from
other parts of the French Union.
The United States, on its part, agreed to contrib-
ute most of the required military end-items and to
ﬁnance most of the monetary cost of the program,
particularly in relation to training, equipping, and
maintaining more local forces.
This arrangement involved a substantial in-
crease in the cost which had been assumed in re-
lation to the mutual security program which was
submitted in the spring of 1953. Even then a

large sum, $400 million, had been asked for and
was appropriated. It was found desirable to in-
crease this dollar amount to $785 million. Also
the volume of military end-items was largely in-
creased. This was done within the framework of
the present act by resort to the ﬂexible transfer
provisions which were used with the approval of
congressional leaders.
This Indochina situation, and also the larger
use of funds in Iran in res. onse to favorable o-
litical developments there, illustrate the vital 1m-
ortance of transfer rovisions which enable the
President to shift fun s in accordance with chang-
ing needs which cannot always be foreseen a year
or more in advance.
“'e shall seek, for 1955, funds for Indochina on
a scale comparable to that which has been found
necessary for the current year.
This item is of great importance as indeed ap-
pears from the illuminating report” of your su -
committee, of which Congressman Judd was
chairman.
There is no reason to question the inherent
soundness of the Navarre Plan. The French
Government, by its declaration of July 3, 1953,
assured com lete inde endence to Viet-Nam, Laos,
and Cambo ia, and t at is bein translated into
reality. The national forces of t ese three States
are being trained and equipped in increasing num-
bers. The French have, as promised, built u
their own forces in Indochina. The French an
national forces have shown superb ﬁghtin quali-
ties in the epic battle of Dien-Bien-Phu. othing
has hap sued to chan e the basic estimate of rela-
tive m1 itary power or 1955. On the contra ,
the Communists are now ex ending reckless y
their military assets in Indociiina.
It seems obvious that they are gambling on a
supreme effort to break the ﬁghting spirit of the
French and Associated States before the present
ﬁghting season ends in May and the Geneva con-
ference gets under way.
That scheme must be frustrated. The way is to
prove that when the Communists use their man-
ower in massive suicidal assaults designed to
Break a single will, the result is the rallyin of
many wills that, together, are unbreakable. 5The
need of the hour is solidarity on the part of the
free world, and notabl on the part of all those
nations which have a dlrect and vital stake in the
freedom of the area. The Governments of France
and of the Associated States ought not to feel that
they stand apart in an hour of supreme trial.
That is the judgment of this administration,
and I feel conﬁdent that that view is shared by
the Congress. I hope that it will be shared by
the other nations concerned. In that way a lesson
can be taught that will protect us all.
