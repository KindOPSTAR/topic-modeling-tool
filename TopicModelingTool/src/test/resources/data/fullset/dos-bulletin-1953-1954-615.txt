Discussions on Status of Women
Statements by Mrs. Lorena B. Hahn
U. 8. Representative on. the U. N. Commission on the Status of Women ‘
POLITICAL RIGHTS OF WOMEN
U.S./U.N. press release dated March 23
[Excerpts]
In 1900 women could vote in only one country,
New Zealand, and in four of the states of the
United States. Today, women vote on equal terms
with men in 60 countries. Two countries, Mexico
and Syria, have moved from the limited suffrage to
the full suffrage column since we last met. The
Secretary-General’s memorandum lists only 17
independent countries in which women are denied
the vote. All this progress has come in a brief
half-century—for many of us, within our own
lifetime. This should be a source of great en-
couragement to us, for it means that the peoples of
our world are ready for change and are seeking
more participation by women in public life.
ThlS progress is even more amazing when we
realize, as we can from Table V, that 2% countries
have taken action favorable to woman suffrage
since the si ing of the charter in 1945—0n1y 9
years ago. an of the countries listed have been
members of our ommission, or are members now.
China, long one of our members, took action in
1947, Costa Rica and Syria in 1949, Haiti in 1950,
Greece and Lebanon in 1952, and Mexico in 1953.
The report shows that every country which has
become a member of this Commission without
woman suffrage has granted women the right to
vote, at least in part, before leaving our Commis-
81011.
This is a proud record—not that we can take
credit for the persistent leadership which has won
the vote for women in these areas, but because we
feel that this Commission has had a part in en-
couraging governments to take the formal action
recognizing the capacity and the wisdom of in-
cluding women in their electorate.
‘ Made In the Commission on Mar. 2‘3, Mar. 25, and Apr. 5.
Because today women vote almost everywhere,
we must guard against a feeling that we need not
concern ourselves about those 17 countries where
women lack political rights. The principle of
equality is as important in one country as in any
other, and we cannot relax until women have equal
suﬁ'rage in all countries. Legislative action has
been started in some of these countries.
I have been especially interested in the docu-
ments on the status of women in trust and non-
self-governing territories. I had not realized,
for instance, the extent to which the people in
these areas are exercising suffrage, and, again, how
rapidly the opportunities to share in the election
process is being extended. In the French Cam-
eroons, for instance, our report shows that suﬂ'rage
has been extended equally, and that in the brief
s ace of 8 years it has been possible to increase
the number of persons exercising the vote from
less than 16,000 to 580,000. In some of these areas
we ﬁnd that there is already universal and equal
suffrage. It is extremely difﬁcult to generalize
about the status of women in areas which differ so
vastly. In each of the reports, however, one feels
that the administering authority is working to en-
courage women to participate in public life. It
was gratifying to note that in the South Paciﬁc
Conference last year there were women in ofﬁcial
dele ations.
1 this makes it evident that our Commission
can now concentrate more on establishing a cli-
mate of acceptance for women as voters. I have
heard of places where the ﬁrst women to go to
the polls were jeered as the passed—not just by
men, but by women also. {Developing a climate
of acceptance is a long-range job. It needs doin
where women have voted for many years, as we
as in countries where the vote is new. We are still
working toward this goal in the United States.
The pamphlet on Political Education of Women
is designed for this purpose.
