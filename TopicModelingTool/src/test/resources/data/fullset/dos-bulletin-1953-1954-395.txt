COMMITTEE HOLDS FIRST MEETING
Press release 112 dated March 5
The Secretary of State’s Public Committee on
Personnel had its ﬁrst meeting on March 5 and
began its survey of measures necessa to
strengthen the professional service to the en that
it be made a more effective instrument of U.S.
foreign relations.
Bearing in mind the intent of Congress as ex-
pressed in the Foreign Service Act of 1946, the
committee decided it will review the prior studies
and recommendations of the Hoover Commission,
the 1950 Advisory Committee on Personnel, and
other groups in this ﬁeld.
The committee will give special consideration to
broadening the personnel base of the Foreign
Service. The objective here is that the Depart-
ment and its establishments abroad may be staffed
to the maximum possible extent by career per-
sonnel, especially trained for the conduct of for-
eign relations and obligated to serve at home or
abroad, thus providing a stronger Foreign Service.
The committee’s ﬁeld of interest will include
the basic organization of the Service and its
strength; the amalgamation program; personnel
management with particular reference to the im-
provement of recruitment, training, and career-
development programs; and the requirements to
increase public conﬁdence and fortify personnel
morale.
Primary responsibility for each of these major
phases of the enterprise will be undertaken by in-
dividual committee members.
Conﬁrmation
The Senate on March 1 conﬁrmed John M. Cabot as
Ambassador to Sweden.
