REORGANIZATION PLAN N0. 2I
I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 2
of 1954, prepared in accordance with the Re-
organization Act of 1949, as amended. The re-
organization plan assigns to appropriate a encies
the liquidation of certain a airs of the econ-
struction Finance Corporation.
First, the reorganization plan transfers to the
Export-Import Bank of Washington loans made
to foreign ﬁnancial institutions and to foreign
overnments, including a loan to the Republic of
t 0 Philippines; all foreign bonds and securities
acquired in the liquidation of Corporation lending
programs; and functions with respect to the liqui-
dation of those assets. The Bank is this Govern-
ment’s rincipal instrument for the administration
of simi ar matters and can readily integrate the
liquidation of the transferred assets with its other
activities in the ﬁeld of foreign ﬁnance.
Second, the reorganization plan transfers to the
Small Business Administration loans made by
the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to vic-
tims of ﬂoods or other catastrophes, together with
the function of liquidating those loans. The
Small Business Administration is responsible for
a similar loan program. Thus, by this transfer,
related activities are concentrated in a single
agency for effective administration.
Third, the reorganization plan transfers to the
Federal National Mortgage Association, in the
Housing and Home Finance A ncy, real estate
mortgages made or acquired un er the authority
of the RFC Mortgage Company and the Defense
Homes Corporation, and the function of liquidat-
ing these assets. The Association is responsible
under its basic authorit for the servicing, liquida-
tion, and sale of the bu k of residential real estate
mortgages held by the Government of the United
States. Through its ﬁeld ofﬁces, the Association
maintains continuous relationships with lending
and investing institutions specializing in home
ﬁnancing. It is, therefore, the Federal agency
best situated to liquidate the assets of a similar
type transferred to it by the reorganization plan.
. Under existin authority, the completion of the
liquidation of t e assets and the Winding up of
the affairs of the Reconstruction Finance Corpo-
