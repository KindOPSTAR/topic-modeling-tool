Responslbllltles of the United States in the Far East
by Walter S. Robertson
Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs1
Some time before the war, the New Y o'rke'r
magazine recounted an incident of an English
woman in New York who inquired of a policeman
if he could direct her to the English Speaking
Union. The policeman replied reassuringly:
“Madam, we all speak English here.” I have a
feeling that the )oliceman was Irish and that his
repl betrayed his continuing surprise that in New
York City, with its population drawn from all the
countries of the Old World, the English language
should be generally understood.
To my mind it is a very great glory of the
English language that, without ever having been
imposed upon anyone, it has become a medium of
communication with which so many national bar-
riers are overcome. It is a bridge connecting the
far-ﬂung parts of the great Commonwealth—the
United Kingdom and Canada, Australia, New
Zealand, and South Africa, Ceylon, India, and
Pakistan. It is a link giving continuity to the
shared experiences of the United States and the
Philippines. It is the language that has made a
nation of the United States, not one in three of
whose citizens is descended from peoples to whom
English was native. I should like to come back
to this point at the end of what I shall say this
evening. For the present I shall only observe
that the name of our organization, “The English
Speaking Union,” always falls on my ears with a
very special impact. It signalizes a phenomenon
that will, I am convinced, stand in history as of
unique signiﬁcance in the development of the
human race.
I have been asked to speak to you on the respon-
sibilities of the United States in the Far East.
This is a happy coincidence in that the subject
is one I am apt to talk about whether I am asked
to do so or not. It is never very far from my

thoughts. In fact, it is as likely to be uppermost
in my mind at 4: 30 a. m. as at 8: 30 p. m.

And every single one of them is right.
There are 'ust as many ways of icturing the
Far East t at also are right. I s all/ask you,
however, to visualize it as a place where two forces
are in collision, like two air masses of op osing
character that meet in what I believe is cal ed an
occluded front. This kind of front, if I am not
mistaken, is characterized by rain, hail, sleet,
li htning, and thunder.
n the Far East, the front reaches from Japan
and Korea throu h Southeast Asia, from whence
it extends to ashmir and Afghanistan. On
almost all parts of its 7,000-mile length there are
turbulences of one kind or another.
At the risk of overdoing our image, we might
say that the warm air mass represents the re-
surgence of Asia—the movement of the Asians to
throw 03 foreign rule and foreign domination;
to catch 11 with the 20th century; to win recog-
nition an respect for their importance; to real-
ize their capa ilities; to achieve tolerable con-
ditions of life for their 0 pressed, ill-nourished,
illiterate fellow beings; a ove all, to achieve the
right to be themselves and to be answerable only
to themselves. The other air mass, pushing its
cold wedges down from the north, represents the
force of aggressive, expansionist world com-
munism, the object of which is antithetical to
the object of the Asian revolution. If successful,
it would bring the whole vast Asian world into
the icy grasp of an alien tyranny.
The results of this collision will inﬂuence the
climate of the world for as far into the future
as we can see. Up to now, the cold air mass,
relying at times upon assault and at others upon
insinuation, has overspread North Korea and
mainland China, has struck deep into Indochina,
