the Director on the Budget and Plan of Ex endi-
ture for 1953 and the proposed budget an plan
of expenditure for 1954.
The Subcommittee found that between Janu-
ary 1 and September 30, 1953, the Committee had
moved 61,025 persons out of Europe bringing the
total moved smce February 1, 1952, to 138,628.
The sources and destinations of the 61,025 were
as follows:

Contributions to administrative expenditure
and miscellaneous income up to October 13, 1953,
totaled $2,218 505. The total of operational in-
come u to ctober 13, 1953, was $22,083,154.
The United States, Brazil, and Luxembourg had
made contributions of free funds to the opera-
tional fund, and other contributions were expected
before the end of the year from Australia, Bel-
gium, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.
On the basis of the report of the Director, the
administrative expenditure for 1953 was revised
from the original estimate of $2,147,000 to 82.130,-
188. The operational expenditure was adjusted
from $34,608,475 to $25,408,814 to cover a total an-
tici ated movement during 1953 of 82.411 persons.
In t e consideration of these adjusted estimates the
Subcommittee learned that the average operational
cost for movement of persons out of Euro to all
destinations is $282 per head and out of S anghai,
$521. The average cost of movement from Shang-
hai has risen because most of the movements have
recently been to Latin American countries. The
administrative cost per person was estimated in
the original budget for 1953 at $17 and in the
revised budget at $24. The Director explained
that administrative costs could not be adjusted up
and down to the volume of movement and that
the staﬂ had gradually been increased within
budgeted limits in order to secure larger move-
ments in 1954 and 1955. The anticipated carry-
over of funds from 1953 to 1954 was estimated to
be 8376.613 under the administrative budget and
$4,063,847 under the operational budget.
As at the previous session the Subcommittee
found that the contributions to the administrative
expenditure had been reasonably satisfactory.
However, contributions to the free funds to re-
vide for nonreimbursable movements had f len
short of anticipation, and these and reimburse-
ments for movements had been dela ed to the point
where the cash position of the ommittee was
endangered.
In considering the proposed budget and plan of
expenditure for 1954, the Subcommittee concluded
that the proposed quota of movement of 132,200
was overoptimistic. The United States repre-
sentative urged strongly that an effort be made to
estimate movements more realistically. since the
high estimates of 1952 and 1953 had proven con-
fusing to governments in makin decisions as to
their respective contributions an also tended to
lessen public conﬁdence in the Committee. As a
result the Director reduced the estimate of move-
ment for 1954 to 117,600 and presented revised
estimates for administrative and operational
expenditure.
The Subcommittee gave close attention to the
proposed plan of expenditure for 1954, examining
each chapter of expense in detail. The Director’s
contention that a total of administrative expendi-
ture originally proposed for the movement of
132,200 would be required for the smaller move-
ment of 117,600 proved unconvincing to the Com-
mittee. A ﬁnal total of $2,401,862 for admin-
istrative expenditure for 1954 was accepted.
Adjustments in the plan of operational expendi-
ture resulted largely from the revised lower quota
of movements adopted. A total of $34,014,812 was
ﬁnally accepted by the Subcommittee, bringing the
total budget for administrative and operational
expenditure to $36,416,674.
The scale of contributions to the administrative
expenditure was revised to 've eii'ect to the mem-
berships of Colombia and ru a in the Com-
mittee. This resulted in slighgl; lower percent-
ages for all member governments. The United
States percentage was set down at 31.32. Certain
overnments questioned the reduction in the
United States percentage on the assumption that
the United States had accepted 33% rcent at
Brussels on a continuing basis. The United States
representative pointed out that no such commit-
ment had been made nor could have. been made
in view of the fact that the United States com-
mitment at Brussels was for 1 year only. The
matter was not pressed and the lower percentage
for the United States was accepted.
Need for Contrlbutlens to Operational Fund
In considering the potential resources for meet-
ing the operational expenditure for 1954, the Sub-
committee found that $4,652,299 in income would
have to be raised in 1954 above the anticipated
contributions of member governments. This fact
challenged the Subcommittee and provided an op-
portunity for the United States representative to
stress again the need for more and larger contri-
