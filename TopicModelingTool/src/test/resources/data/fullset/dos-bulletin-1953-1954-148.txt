STATEMENT BY AMBASSADOR LODGE
Press release 83 dated January 2.2
The release of the prisoners makes clear the
shining truth that man is entitled to freedom and
will not be forced to return to the control of a
regime repugnant to his natural desires for self-
expression. This is a victory for freedom every-
where and gives hope to others less fortunate. t
has been well worth the effort.
The signiﬁcance of the United Nations position
on this principle must have left its impression on
the Communists and have further convinced
others of the sincerity of our dedication to human
libert . Its meaning will not be overlooked in
any ture planning by those who may contem-
late aggressive action. They will remember that
greedom is the popular choice and the desire for
freedom can overcome even the most intense in-
doctrination and brutal discipline.
The free world has a special right to feel ha By
about the return of these men. \Ve have stood) y
a principle and won. \Ve welcome to the free
world the men who today have chosen the free
way over tyranny and persecution!
STATEMENT BY AMBASSADOR WADSWORTH
U.S./RN. press release dated January 22
Today some 22,000 Korean and Chinese rison-
ers of war have become free citizens of t e free
world. This act is a beacon of new hope to mil-
lions now living under Communist tyranny.
The prisoners who chose freedom have demon-
Fabruary I, 1954
strated what the principle of nonforcible repatria-
tion means in human terms. It is a doctrine of
freedom. It is an international antislavery doc-
trine—shaped in United Nations debate, tempered
on Korean battleﬁelds, incorporated in the Korean
Armistice Agreement, and proven now by the
brave men who have turned their backs on com-
munism forever.
The free world has battled for an important
humanitarian principle and won. The prisoners
who chose freedom over tyranny and persecution
have earned the respect of every nation where the
rights of man, not the powers of the state, are
supreme. Their freedom toda further discredits
the false idea that man is a too , a mere possession
of the state. Dictators will remember that neither
long detention, nor constant Communist threats,
nor brutal discipline can crush the desire for
freedom.
The free world has proven that it will not break
faith with those who stand for freedom against
slavery. It has remained true to the noble ur-
oses for which free men sacriﬁced so muc in
orea. Now, the United Nations has struck a his-
toric blow for collective securit and human
freedom. It could not have done ess.
GENERAL TI'IIMAYYA'S LETTER OF JANUARY 18
To the Coﬂmwnder-in-Chief, United Nation;
Command.
I have the honor to refer to your letter of J anu-
ary 16.1 In paragraph 7 of this letter you have
said that in View of my “stated intention to release
unilaterall the prisoners of war starting 20 Janu-
ary, the nited Nations Command must neces-
sarily be pre ared to arrange for their accommo-
dation and isposition.” I feel that the request
made in my letter of Janua 14' has been mis-
understood by you.
I am taking this op rtunity
to clarify the request and the reasons which have
impelled me to make this request.
n my letter of January 14, I have pointed out
that the NNRC has come to the decision that it has
no competence, in existin circumstances, either
to release Pow’s, or to decline relief from Pow to
civilian status, or to continue custody be 'ond
January 23. In view of this decision, I, as C air-
man and Executive A ent and havin custody of
Pow’s, have come to t e conclusion that the only
correct, lawful and peaceful course open is to re-
store Pow’s to the custody of the former detaining
sides immediately prior to January ‘23. I am,
therefore, r uesting each detaining side to accept
Restoration 0 custody as from January 20 at 0900
ours.
