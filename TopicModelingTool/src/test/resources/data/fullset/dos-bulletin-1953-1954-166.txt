facilities which it was contemplated should be put
at the disposal of the Security Council (article
43) for the purpose of maintaining international
peace and security.
The Council’s inability to function as designed
has been priinari] due to the abuse by the Soviet
Union of its so-ca led veto power.
This same veto power has been abused by the
Soviet Union to exclude from membershi in the
United Nations many countries fully ualiﬁed for
membership under the terms of artic e 4, which
provides that the United Nations membership is
0 en to all peace-loving states which accept the
obligations contained in the present charter and
are able and willing to carry out these obligations.
Nations excluded by the Soviet veto are: Aus-
tria, Cambodia, Ceylon, Eire, Finland, Italy,
Japan, Jordan, Republic of Korea, Laos, Libya,
Nepal, Portugal, Viet-Nam.
Clutter Ileth Conference
We are now approaching a time when in all
probability there will be a review of the charter
with a view to its possible amendment. Article
109 3) of the charter provides that a roposal
to ca 1 such a conference shall be placed) on the
agenda of the tenth annual session of the General
Assembly, i. e., that of 1955, and present indica-
tions are that a review conference will be held.
The United States has already indicated that it
expects to favor the holding of a review
conference.
The Executive welcomes this coordinate action
of the Senate in stud ing the problems which will
confront such a con erence.
The Executive approaches this conference with
an awareness of the desirability of perfecting the
charter, but also with a determination not to lose
the good that is in the search for something better.
“'e have not yet taken any ﬁrm osition with
respect to charter amendments. e defer that
until we have further advanced our own studies
and ascertained the views of our citizenry and
Congress and of other nations. In this connec-
tion, we do not forget that charter amendments
reqijiire Senate consent.
nder the circumstances, I shall limit myself
to indicating some of the ma'or questions which
might be brought before the harter Review Con-
ference and as to which there should be an edu-
cated public opinion.
1. Universality—It is useful that there be an
organization which is, generally speaking, uni-
versal and whose processes run throughout the
world. Otherwise the association takes on the
character of an alliance. Of course, universality
inevitably means bringing together nations whose
governments may strongly disagree. This has dis-
advanta es. But such an organization maintains
contacts etween potential enemies, affords o por-
tunities to dispel unnecessary misunderstan ings,
and, as President Eisenhower said in his State of
the Union Message on January 7, 1954, it provides
“the only real world forum where we have the
opportunity for international presentation and
rebuttal.” This rocess tends, though slow] , to
bring about con ormity to a common stan ard.
It is, of course, unlikely that there will be uni-
versality in the complete and literal sense of that
word. Unfortunately, there are governments or
rulers who do not respect the elemental decencies
of international conduct, so that they can properly
be brought into the or anized family of nations.
That is illustrated by the regime which now rules
the China mainland.
Even approximate universality does, of course,
carry certain disadvantages. There are bound to
be differences of opinion which limit effectiveness
of action.
Doubtless, at the Charter Review Conference,
consideration will be given to these problems of
universality or limited membership. It will per-
ha 5 be considered whether article 4, to which I
re erred above, expresses the desirable standards
for membership.
In this connection, it should be recalled that
articles 5 and 6 permit of suspension and expul-
sion, although this requires Security Council ac-
tion, which in turn is subject to veto.
It seems at the resent time that most of the
members of the Ifiiited Nations feel that it is
better to have even discordant members in the or-
ganization rather than to attempt to conﬁne mem-
bershi to those who hold the same views.
In this connection, it is to be borne in mind that
few nations for long share the same views about
every matter. Where they do share the same se-
curity views, or have regional community, they
can organize themselves under article 51 (collec-
tive security) or under the provisions of articles
52—54 (regional arrangements).
2. Security—By the charter (article 24) the Se-
curity Council is su posed to exercise “primary
responsibility for e maintenance of interna-
tional peace and security.” Can charter changes
better enable it to discharge that responsibility?
Or must that primary res onsibility be left to
security orgéinizations, the fbrmation of which is
authorized article 51? Or should greater re-
sponsibility be given to the General Assembly,
where there is no veto?
In this connection I should note the “Uniting for
Peace Resolution” of 1950 which puts the General
Assembly in a position to play a decisive role with
reference to peace and security in the event that
the Security Council is paralyzed by a veto.
3. Security Council—Are the present provisions
for membership and voting in the Security Coun-
cil conducive to its maximum effectiveness?
Should the veto power be taken away in respect of
questions involving Paciﬁc Settlement of Disputes
(chapter VI) and in respect of the Admissmn of
New Members, as recommended by S. R. 239
