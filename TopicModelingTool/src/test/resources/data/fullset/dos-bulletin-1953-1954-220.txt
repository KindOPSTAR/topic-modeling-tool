recommended to the Government of the German Demo-
cratic Republic and the Government of the German Federal
Republic to call promptly a meeting of plenipotentiary
representatives of Eastern and Western Germany in order
to agree upon the procedure to be followed in the forma-
tion of the provisional all-German government, its compo-
sition, functions, tasks, and powers.
5. The Governments of the Soviet Union, France. the
United Kingdom, and the U. S. A., for their part, shall
take measures to create conditions which will contribute
to the successful fulﬁllment by the provisional all-German
U.S. Policy Toward Japan

One of the compensations for working in the
State Department is that occasionally one is per-
mitted to escape, to get out and exchange ideas
with some of the elect of the country. Amon
these elect I include articularly these men an
women who, with no ope or expectation of gain
or recognition, give up their time and energy to
thinking about and discussing the interests of our
Nation in world affairs. Without the informed
and disinterested scrutiny such persons bring to
it, our foreign policy would be erratic and self-
defeatin , reﬂecting not the national interest but
the shifting balance of ower among various pres-
sure groups and the i iosyncrasies of indiVidual
oﬁicials.
The Cleveland Council on World Affairs was
founded in 1923. That was only 31 years ago.
Yet in many ways it was another era. In 1923
we were preoccupied with our own affairs and
dizzy with the new and exciting prospects opened
up by our great industrial expansion and its ac-
companying prosperity. The jazz ace, the motor
age, the moving picture age, and the radio age
were upon us. Prohibition and the ways of cir-
cumventing it were inexhaustible subjects of con-
versation. Every day, it seemed, the press re-
ported that another mother of three had swum
the English Channel. We had little attention to
spare for what was taking place in two countries—
each destined to exert tremendous inﬂuence on its
own side of the world where democracy was ﬁght-
ing for its chance.
n Germany, the Weimar Republic was 4 years
old. In Japan, the spirit of liberalism and inter-
nationalism was in the ascendant. The Crown

government of its tasks and which will preclude any inter-
ference and pressure by foreign powers during the all-
German elections. To this end the governments of the
Four Powers have agreed to withdraw the occupation
forces from the territory of both Eastern and Western
Germany even prior to the elections with the exception
of limited contingents left to perform protective tune
tions arising out of tasks of control by the Four Powers:
For the U.S.S.R. in regard to Eastern Germany and for the
U.S.A., the United Kingdom and France in regard to
Western Germany.

hito had 2 years before broken all prece ents and
had set foot outside Japan. He had, in fact,
toured Europe. Ja an had a representative gov-
ernment. In Marc 1 1925 the vote was given to
all Japanese males over the age of 25. Japan was
an ally of the United States, Great Britain, and
France in a four-power treaty.
After 1930, the forces of democracy were in re-
treat in Japan. That year brought the assassina-
tion of Premier Hamaguchi, who had accepted a
less favorable ratio in warships for Japan at the
London Naval Conference than was agreeable to
Japanese nationalists. In that year also economic
depression became serious for Japan. Agricul-
ture was particularly hard hit and the result was
a wave of what has been called radical nationalism,
a phenomenon in Japan not entire] dissimilar to
the wave of radical nationalism tien gathering
force in Germany under the swastika.
If this were the First Annual Institute of the
Council of World Affairs of 1926 and if we knew
what we know now, we should surely be stressing
the importance of our doing all we could to bring
about conditions favorable to the cause of repre-
sentative government in Japan and Germany.
IVhat we could or should have done in 1926, I shall
not t1;y to say. My own feeling about the 20-year
perio between the two world wars is that too often
when we should have been generous we were selﬁsh
and when we should have been stron we were
weak, until ﬁnally we were able to stan ﬁrm only
at the cost of general war.
I am by no means blaming us for all that grew
out of the 1920’s and 1930’s. To what extent the
issue was in our hands at an stage, I do not know.
All we can know for sure is t at those things which
were done did not avert catastrophe.
