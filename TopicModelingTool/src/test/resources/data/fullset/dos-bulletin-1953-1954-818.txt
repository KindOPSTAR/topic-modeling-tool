part, appear to be close and willin accomplices
in this plot, expecting to gain much or themselves
as junior partners in the Sine-Soviet alliance. It
is also important to remember that the Chinese
Communists are thoroughly schooled in the same
tradition as their Soviet mentors. The Chinese
have proved to be apt pupils and have even added
a few twists of their own to the Soviet 1e acy,
both in their internal and external conduct. om-
munist China’s im erialistic adventures in both
Korea and in Indoc ina, although not the same in
form, have both followed orthodox Communist
patterns.
The best hope of communism is in a situation
where it can deal separately and individually with
its intended victims. Its spread was halted in
Europe only when this became impossible. The
Communist attempt to swallow the whole of Korea
failed because of united action of a kind unique
in history, but Korea remains divided. The Com-
munists so far have been able to concentrate their
attention in turn upon Indochina without the
deterrent of that collective security which must
yet be devised for Free Asia if it is not to be
enslaved in the Communist fashion, piecemeal.
Issues of incalculable import are in the balance
in Asia at this time. I have dwelt initially upon
as ects somewhat broader than our immed1ate
su ject in order to set the pers tive for the role
Communist China has been a1 otted to play, and
indeed is playing, in the world Communist pro-
gram of conquest. It has been given primary
responsibility for the communization of the rest of
Asia but has recognized the leadership of the S0-
viet Union for the whole of the Communist camp.
Since April 26 our representatives have been in
Geneva to discuss the two most serious sources of
tension in the Far East, the danger spots of Korea
and Indochina. In both instances it is primarily
Communist China, with the full support of the
Soviet Union, which has thus endangered the peace
of the world. We are participating in the Con-
ference at Geneva with the sincere purpose of
seeking a settlement of these two great Asian
problems. We still hope that at least some prog-
ress toward reducing tensions in the Far East
may be possible. We are, however, keenly aware
of the Communists’ record of bad faith. We are
especially mindful of the Chinese Communists’
wonted use of the conference table as a means
of waging war by carefully timed cease-ﬁre, a
tactic used by them to great advantage in the
Chinese civil war. During the cease-ﬁre in Korea,
by means of a deliberate and systematic circum-
vention of the Armistice Agreement, the Com-
munists have engaged in a signiﬁcant military
build-up in North Korea. It would be fatuous
to agree at Geneva to a cease-ﬁre in Indochina
without adequate safeguards against this all-too-
familiar Communist tactic.
Whatever the Communist intent with respect to
Korean and Indochinese settlements, they have
stridently demanded that the convicted aggressor
whose acts have chieﬂy made the conference neces-
sary be accorded international acceptance and so-
called big- ower status in this conference. We
and our a1 les refused to ield to these demands
and to convene a so-calle ﬁve-power conference
to deal with world problems, for which the Com-
munists were so anxious. Communist China is
necessarily at the conference, since it is deeply
involved in both questions to be considered. Com-
munist China obviously wants to achieve, partly
by means of this conference itself, general dip-
lomatic recognition by the family of nations, a
seat in the United Nations, and a relaxation of
trade restrictions.
Nature of Chlnese Communlst Regime
What is the nature of this regime which un-
ashamedly demands international acceptance at
a conference called to deal urgently with problems
chieﬂy of that regime’s own creation? It came
to power by force of arms and with full moral, and
limited material, support of an alien power which
even at that time was bound by a treat of friend-
ship and alliance with the Chinese overnment
under President Chiang Kai-shek. It came to
power by the familiar “united front” tactics, dis-
carded as soon as police state controls made it
possible. We do not believe that it represents the
will of the people it overns. It has acted on no
recognizable standar s of international conduct.
It has repeatedly expressed contem t for the pur-
poses and principles of the Unites Nations and
still stands convicted by that body as an aggressor
in Korea. Its aggressive record in Korea, Indo-
china, and Tibet and its relentless rogram of in-
ﬁltration and subversion in other sian countries
Kake it a serious threat to all the free peoples of
em.
By stepping up the ﬁghting in Indochina in an
obvious attempt to inﬂuence the outcome of the
Geneva Conference the Communists have shown
the same callous disregard for the extravagant
expenditure of Viet Minh lives as they showed for
Chinese lives in Korea. The Chinese Communist
regime disregarded the most elemental rules of
prisoner-of-war treatment in Korea, committing
unspeakable atrocities against United Nations
troops. It has carried on a methodical “Hate
America” campaign among its own people and
has subjected American and other foreign nation-
als to all manner of indignity, has conﬁscated
foreign property without compensation, and has
often made it impossible for foreign business
establishments either to carry on or to close down.
It still holds 32 American civilians in prison, in-
communicado, under intolerable physical con-
ditions, without trial and without even a state-
ment of charges. It has developed “brain
