Review of Annual ECE Economic Survey
Statement by Winthrop G. B room 1
As my delegation was preparing our Govern-
ment’s comments on the survey,“ one of my col-
leagues remarked that it was much harder to com-
ment on a good report than on a bad one.
\Ve take great satisfaction in the fact that the
Secretariat has made our task so difﬁcult by pro-
ducing so good a survey. If we diﬁ'er here or there
from some of its conclusions or analysis. this in
no way detracts from our general appreciation of
its merits.
This year’s surve is impressive for its scope,
for its selection an concentration on the ma]0r
problems of the European economy, and its pro-
vocative and original discussion of these issues.
To the skill, energy, and imagination which we
have come to take for granted from the Secretariat
has been added an improved balance in presenta-
tion and more realistic standards of judgment.
We note with satisfaction that the survey pre-
sents a careful and comprehensive record of major
improvement in the internal and external economic
affairs of Western Europe. This year’s survey
rightly emphasizes the progress of the past year
in Western Europe, and the opportunities for
further improvement that lie ahead.
Main Factors oi Improvement
As for the progress of the past year, the survey
records that, during the course of 1953, Western
European industrial production generally im-
proved, “with some countries” showing “a con-
siderable growth in industrial production,” while
still maintaining ﬁnancial stability. The recovery
has been strongest in the consumer-goods indus-
tries, most notably textiles, which had given great-
est cause for concern in the previous year. The
growth of agricultural out ut continued, and food
rationing was progressive y eliminated. Agricul-
tural output in \Vestern Europe in 1952—53 reached
its peak for the postwar period, and livestock
products were at levels well above the 1934—38

average. While production in the metal-using in-
dustries showed some signs of hesitation, this may
have been in large measure a delayed response to
the 1952 decline in the consumer industries.
The survey rightl indicates that a more sub-
stantial expansion 0 production might have been
both desirable and feasible, without threatening
a renewal of inﬂationary pressures. It should be
emphasized, however, that the maintenance of in-
ternal ﬁnancial stability is an indispensable basis
for continued future investment and expansion.
To have brought prolonged inﬂation so success-
fully under control has been an outstanding
achievement which might have been jeopardize
by too strong an insistence on continuous expan-
sion at all periods.
Despite these reservations, however, we would
agree with the survey on the compelling need for
further economic expansion and the forward devel-
opment of Western Europe’s tremendous economic
capabilities. To the measures discussed in the
survey through which expansion should take place,
we would add and emphasize increased productiv-
ity, especially advantageous as an oﬁ'set to inﬂa-
tionary pressures. The Western European coun-
tries, in recognition of the importance of this
factor, have in the past year intensiﬁed their col-
lective efforts to promote a more productive use of
available resources.
Together with the maintenance of internal sta-
bility and the recovery of production last year,
there came a marked improvement in the external
position both of Western Europe as a whole, and
of most individual countries in Western Europe.
Gold and dollar reserves rose marked] . The vol-
ume of intra~Eur0pean trade expan ed, and ex-
ports to the dollar area rose to record heights. As
the survey points out, the improvement in the
external posrtion of \Vestern Europe as a whole
contributed very great] to an easing of the strains
in intra-European tra e and ayments, and per-
mitted a substantial recover 0 past regressions in
the liberalization of intra- uropean trade. The

operation is now seeking to lay the basis for
further advance. The surve correctl recog-
