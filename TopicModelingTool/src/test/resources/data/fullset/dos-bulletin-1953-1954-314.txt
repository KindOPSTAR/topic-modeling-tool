The Israel Government stressed both the “prac-
tical” character of the transfer and the historical
tradition of Jerusalem. On July 16, all the Arab
States sent identical letters of rotest to the Sec-
rotary-General of the United ations. Secretary
Dulles dealt with the problem in his press confer-
ence on July 28, noting that the United States had
made its feelings known to the Israel Government
on two prior occasions, in July 1952 and March
1953, when Israel was requested not to transfer the
Foreign Ministry to Jerusalem. He added:“
. . . We believe that it would embarrass the United
Nations, which has a primary responsibility for deter-
mining the future status of Jerusalem. You may recall
that the presently standing U.N. resolution about Jeru-
salem contemplates that it should be to a large extent at
least an international city rather than a purely national
city. Also, we feel that this particular action by the Gov-
ernment of Israel at this particular time is inopportune
in relation to the tensions which exist in the Near East,
tensions which are rather extreme, and that this will add
to rather than relax any of these tensions.
The Secretary also indicated that these views were
shared by a considerable number of other govern-
ments which were concerned with the development
of an atmosphere of peace and good will in the
Near East.“5
On September 2, 1953, in response to a letter of
July 16 from the Israel Foreign Ministry, the
United Nations Conciliation Commission for
Palestine drew the attention of the Israel Govern-
ment to the position which it had “ado ted in the
past on the question of the transfer 0 ministries
of the Israel Government to Jerusalem, in the
li ht of the special status accorded that city b the
re evant decisions of the General Assem l .”
Amon other things, the Conciliation Commission
noted its‘ letter of March 30, 1949, in which it had
advised the Israel Government that transfer of
certain ministries and departments to Jerusalem
“would be incompatible with paragraph 8 of the
General Assembly Resolution of 11 December 1948
which resolved that the Jerusalem area should be
accorded special and separate treatment from the
rest of Palestine and should be placed under effec-
tive United Nations control.”
Another problem which developed in the fall
of 1953, and for which it proved diﬁicult to ﬁnd a
solution at the time, involved a hydroelectric proj-
ect on the Jordan River at Banat Ya’qub, in the
Israel-Syrian Demilitarized Zone. Sponsored by
the Israel Government Water Planning Authority,

"On Aug. 4, representatives of Arab States with the
exception of the Minister of Jordan, protested both to the
Foreign Oﬂice in London and to the Department of State
in the United States. The Israel Embassy at Washington
on Aug. 5 issued a long statement defending the transfer.
There was some speculation as to what the Soviet Union
would do when. according to an agreement reached in
July, it resumed diplomatic relations with Israel; it is
interesting to note that the Soviet envoy paid a visit to
Fgreign Minister Sharett in Jerusalem on December 2,
1 53.
the roject was based on a concession granted to
the alestine Electric Corporation on March 5,
1926; work was begun on September 2, 1953. The
Syrian Government on September 21 asked the
Israel-Syrian Mixed Armistice Commission to
halt the work, charging that the roject would dry
up some 12,000 acres of Syrian and by diverting
the Jordan waters.“ As Chief of Staff of the
United Nations Truce Supervision Organization,
Gen. Vagn Bennike called for a cessation of work
on the project on September 23, as long as an agree-
ment was not arranged.“ Foreign Minister
Moshe Sharett of Israel contested the Bennike
view on September 24 and declared that “in the
speciﬁc circumstances of the present case no issues
exist which call for such agreement, and conse-
quently the continuation of the work cannot be
made conditional thereon.” a‘ In a reply of Oc-
tober 20, General Bennike repeated his views as
to both the economic and the mllitary consequences
of the project and noted his authority in the mat-
ter under article VII of the General Armistice
' A reement."m
ile this roblem was developing, there oc-
curred the raid of Israel forces on the Jordan
village of Qibiya on October 14-15, in which some
250 soldiers were involved, according to the Mixed
Armistice Commission, and in which some 53
Arab men, women, and children were killed. On
October 18 the Department of State announced : ‘°
The U.S. Government has the deepest sympathy for the
families of those who lost their lives in and near Qibya
during the recent attack by Israeli forces. The shocking
reports which have reached the Department of State of the
loss of lives and property involved in this incident con-
vince us that those who are responsible should be brought
to account and that effective measures should be taken
to prevent such incidents in the future.
The U.S. Government has been increasingly concerned
at the mounting tension along the frontier between Israel
and the neighboring Arab States. It is for this reason
that it initiated the recommendation and subsequently, in
concert with the British and French Governments, decided
to request the Security Council to consider. at the earliest
possible date, the situation on the frontiers, to include a
direct report by Gen. Vagn Bennike, Chief of Staff of the
United Nations Truce Supervision Organization.
Secretary Dulles, Foreign Secretary Eden, and
Foreign Minister Bidault considered the Qibiya
incident at their London meeting of October 16—
18; their ﬁnal communique included the follow-
mg=“
The Foreign Ministers noted with grave concern the
recent incidents culminating in Israeli armed action of
October 14 in Qibya, which, according to their informa‘
tion, resulted in serious loss of life and- property inside
Jordan.
