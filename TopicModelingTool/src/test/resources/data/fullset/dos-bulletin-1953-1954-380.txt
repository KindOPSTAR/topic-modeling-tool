the many treasures brought back from China by
traders to enrich our lives, in exchange for Amer-
ican machinery and manufactured goods and
\Vestern ideas. Our two peoples have also become
accustomed to the sort of exchange that is taking
place today. It has become habitual for us each to
end the other those facilities which each can spare
and which the other needs for the common defense.
You have given us landing ﬁelds, buildings, roads,

Mutual Interest In Paciﬁc Security
The historic association between China and the
United States reﬂects an appreciation by both
countries of their communlty of interests. I
should not be a proper oﬁicial of the Department
of State if I did not direct attention to that fact.
And the communit of interests between us is im-
pellin . Danger as generally come to China
from t e landward side, from the north and west.
Danger has generall come to the United States
from the Atlantic si e, from the east. China and
the United States have thus both had the keenest
interest in preserving the security and peace of the
Paciﬁc so that each could concentrate on defend-
ing itself where it was most ex osed. Each coun-
try has had an instinctive rea ization of the im-
portance to it of the other, and of their common
need to be able to stand back to back, as it were.
for each to have the comfort of knowing that it
was secure on one side at least.
Both countries have been alert to the threat that
would be posed by the intrusion between them of
any kind of aggressive imperialism. Even if the
Chinese and American peoples had no regard for
each other, as peoples, they would still inevitably
be drawn together by their common vital inter-
est in the security of the Paciﬁc. Whenever there
are signs in either country of lack of appreciation
of this interdependence, the danger signals are up.
Neither country can afford to relax if the inde-
pendence and integrity of the other is not secure.
Today mainland China is oriented toward China’s
greatest enemy and away from its traditional
source of support. Those who are responsible for
this unnatural and tragic situation have demon-
strated in this, as in so many other ways, their
disregard of China’s interests. It is not remark-
able that having determined upon the subordina-
tion of China’s welfare and independence to a for-
eign ideology, they should at the same time have
chosen in their propaganda to portray the United
States as the most implacable enemy of their
designs.
I wish I could say that our support of China’s
independence had always been as concrete and as
forward as circumstances required. For long
years, China sustained alone the trials of the
Japanese invasion. Our refusal to accept J apa-
nese control of China was a major motivating
factor in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor,
but it required the shock of that attack to arouse
the American people to determined and effective
counteraction. Before then, the free world, while
sympathizing with China, had been restrained
from effective intervention in the war by lack of
unity and purpose.
The costs of the war with Japan not only caused
grievous setbacks to the hopes and accomplish-
ments to which the revolutionary movement under
Chiang Kai-shek in the 1920’s had given rise. The
war also left China shaken and weakened and ill-
prepared to cope with the blow in the back that
followed hard upon the end of that war. Once
more catastrophe engulfed China while, despite
the deep concern of the American peo Ie, the
United States failed to appreciate the all sig-
niﬁcance of events until it was itself involved
militarily in the consequences—this time, by an
attack on the Republic of Korea ordered by the
mentor of the regime that had gained control of
mainland China.
The events of the 1930’s and 1940s are past.
What is important now is that we apply in
the )rcsent and future the lessons the past has
tang it us.
I have been 5 eaking so far of the strategical
considerations tlat draw our two countries to-
gether. But the truth is that when we think of
the Chinese we think only secondarily of strategy.
\Ve think ﬁrst of friendshi . It has been our good
fortune that the people wit whom we have always
reco nized we must cooperate from necessity
shou d have been a people with whom we would
have wished to cooperate from choice.
U. S. Admlratlon for Chlncse
It is striking that the oldest and the youngest
of the great powers should have found so much
in common. It would be easy for me to explain
our admiration for the Chinese in terms of the
staggering achievements of 4,000 years of Chinese
culture. This would, however, claim a rather
more intensive knowledge of Chinese history than
most of us Americans possess. The fact of the
matter is that we like the Chinese because of what
they are as human beings. YVe like their quick
friendliness of response, their warm hospitality,
their meticulous courtesy, their conviviality and
sense of humor. \Ve like them because they are
loyal to their friends and devoted to their families,
because they are pragmatic and realistic, because
they live in the present and believe in improving
it by dint of hard work—qualities that perhaps
we share. And we admire them without reserva-
tion for those qualities that we have not—I am
