The Near East and the West
by Eric Johnston
Special Representative of the President1
Six years have passed since the United Nations
artitioned Palestine between the Arabs and the
ews.
They have been 6 years of tension, unabated bit-
terness and recurrent bloodshed.
They have been 6 years of constant, painstak-
in%searching for the way to peace.
at there is still no peace in Palestine.
The dispute between the Arab States and the
State of Israel remains a sputtering fuse that
might at any time touch 0 world war in the
atomic age. This is one certaint in the whole
complex and perilous situation—t e certainty of
danger to the world. Another is the certainty
that the nations of the world cannot permit the
danger to persist.
But after 6 years of fruitless searching, which
way may we look for a solution? It is all too
apparent that political rapprochement between
Israel and her Arab neighbors is no likelier today
than it was last year or the year before. Time
has had little healing inﬂuence; the breach is as
wide as ever. Instead of abating, tensions have
mounted—recentl almost to the breaking point.
If reconciliation 1s ossible, and we must believe
that it is, we must a so, unfortunately, admit that
it is not likely to come easily or soon.
Nor will it come all at once. The impasse that
has deﬁed every effort of the United Nations for
the last 6 years is not goin to melt suddenly away.
It will give way gradualI , if at all—bit by bit,
and in response to mounting pressures from inside
the region as well as to inﬂuences from outside.
In these circumstances, it seems to me that the
U.S. ,policy of “sympathetic and impartial friend-
ship, as the President recently stated it, must
contemplate two simultaneous methods of ap-
proach. It must envisage our continued active
participation in United Nations efforts to bring
about a ﬁnal and durable settlement between
Israel and the Arab world; and it must look to
the more immediate objective of removing or re-

ducing the points of controversy that keep the
quarrel alive.
This means that while we try, in concert with
other nations of the West, to achieve an ultimate
political settlement, we must exert every reason-
able eﬁ'ort to remove present irritants and causes
of tension.
Mission to Middle East
Some months ago, President Eisenhower en-
trusted me with a mission to the Middle East—a
s ecial mission calculated to help relieve some of
t e more acute reasons for tension between the
Arab countries and Israel. I welcome the oppor-
tunity to explain the nature of this mission to you
here toni ht. But before I do so there are one
or two thlngs I would like to say by way of back-
ground.
First, I believe it is necessary to deal with the
situation as it now exists. We are confronted by
what is; not by what mic-ht have been. The con-
ﬂict between Arab and Jaw in the Near East goes
back to dim antiquity, and it seems important to
deﬁne the area of our discussion in time, as clearly
as it is deﬁned in geography.
We must start, it seems to me, with November
1947 when the decision of the United Nations to
partition Palestine brou ht a new factor into the
ancient quarrel between rab and Jew. That fac-
tor was the State of Israel. Its birth, at the end
of the British Mandate, transformed a dispute
between two groups of people into a dispute be-
tween sovereign states. Hlstorians may forever
debate the wisdom of the United Nations decision
to partition the mandated territory of Palestine;
the may quarrel endlessly, as they will, over the
early recognition accorded Israel by the United
States.
But the reality is that such a solution was
adopted, that Israel was created and reco ized,
and that it does exist today as a full-ﬁedge mem-
ber of the community of nations. The only valid
assumption, and one of the basic considerations of
American policy in the region, is that it will con-
tinue to emst.
