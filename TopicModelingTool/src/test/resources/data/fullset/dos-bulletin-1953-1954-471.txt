that agreement were suspended at the beginning
of World WVar II, the International Sugar Coun-
cil was continued as a forum for the discussion of
postwar roblems. A protocol extending our
participation in the Council was considered favor-
ably each year by the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee. The last protocol was a proved by
the Senate on July 27, 1953. You will)recall that
the annual protocol recognized that a revised in-
ternational sugar agreement was necessary and
should be undertaken. The sugar agreement now
before on is the revision contemplated by the
protoco s, and was negotiated at a world confer-
ence last summer attended by 50 countries.
The new sugar agreement is an attempt on the
part of both importin and exporting countries
to meet the realities o the postwar sugar situa-
tion. A surplus of approximately 2.5 million tons
exist at the present time, and productive capacity
is increasing. World prices receded last year to
the lowest levels since 1945 despite the fact that
Cuba, the world’s largest producer, had restricted
its cropby 28 ercent and withheld 2 million tons
from the worl market. The International Sugar
Agreement would share this burden by assignlng
market quotas to the ex orting countries and ad-
justing them eriodica 1y to the needs of the
market. To sa eguard the interests of consumers,
exporters are required to maintain stocks and a
limit is placed on the extent export quotas may be
reduced to accomplish the price objectives of the
agreements.
An important consideration for the United
States is the fact that this agreement will not
change the pattern of our trade in sugar. Im rts
into the United States are speciﬁcally exc uded
from the agreement. The quantit of sugar avail-
able to this market will not be a ected. Our do-
mestic sugar legislation will continue to regulate
the volume and source of our imports as it does
at the present time.
The Department of State, of course, has relied
heavily on the views of the Department of Agri-
culture and the domestic sugar industry as to the
importance of the agreement to American pro-
ducers and processors. We have had several
meetings with representatives of the sugar grow-
ers and processors. Several re resentatives
served on the U.S. dele ation to the orld Sugar
Conference and were 0 material assistance in the
negotiations. The case for an international sugar
agreement appears to be an exceptional one and
to be dictated by both domestic and foreign policy
considerations, and the Department has been glad
to cooperate with the Department of Agriculture
and the industry to bring it about.
To date ﬁve countries have ratiﬁed the agree-
ment and 17 others have notiﬁed that they intend
to seek ratiﬁcation. As most of the countries in-
terested in the agreement were anxious that it
become eﬁective as of January 1, 1954, it was pro-
vided that such notiﬁcations would be accepted
in lieu of ratiﬁcation for the purpose of putting
the agreement into effect provisionally for a
4-month period. The United States coo erated
with the others in ﬁling a notice that rati cation
would be sought as rapidly as possible under our
constitutiona procedures. Of course, no obliga-
tions with respect to the agreement were assumed
by the United States throu h this action.
The condition of the wor d’s sugar industry af-
fects the economies of many nations and the live-
lihood of many peoples.
This a reement, while it will not solve all of
the worl ’s sugar roblems, is a constructive step
toward their solution. The De artment of State
sincerely believes that it woul be to the advan-
tage of the United States both from the stand-
pomt of its domestic sugar interests and from the
standpoint of its foreign relations to ratify the
agreement, and it is out of this conviction that
we respectfully recommend its favorable consid-
eration by this Committee.
