Soviet Airplane Incidents of July 27 and 29, 1953
STATEMENT BY THE DEPARTMENT
Press release 90 dated February 24
The United States Government, following ex-
haustive investigations of two air incidents which
occurred in the Far East in July, 1953, instructed
the American Embassy at Moscow to deliver two
notes to the Soviet Government concerning these
incidents. The notes were delivered to the Soviet
Foreign Ofﬁce on January 26, 1954, by Chargé
d’Affaires Elim O’Shaughnessy.
One note concerns the shooting down by Soviet
aircraft of a United States Air Force RB—50 air-
craft and its crew of 17 over the Sea of Japan.
The note states in part:
The United States Government desires, before consider-
lng further action, to receive from the Soviet Government
ﬁrst, explicit and unambiguous details of the Soviet Gov-
ernment‘s claims as to the facts and the applicable propo-
sitions of law and, secondly, the latest evidence which
the Soviet Government may possess or have available
bearing on the question of survivors from the RB—50
crew.
The second note involves a claim by the Soviet
Government for $1,861,450, based on an alleged de-
struction by United States military aircraft on
July 27, 1953, of an 111—12 airplane. United
States military authorities in Korea announced on
July 27, 1953, the destruction by Capt. Ralph S.
Parr, USAF, of an IL—12 aircraft in North Korea.
\Vhen Ambassador Bohlen, on July 31, 1953, pro-
tested the destruction by Soviet aircraft of the
RB—50 over international waters,1 he was informed
of an alleged destruction on July 27, 1953, of a
Soviet IL—12 airplane in Manchuria. The Soviet
Government asserted that this was the Soviet air-
plane reported by United States Air Force au-
thorities as having been shot down by Captain
Parr. In this regard the second note states:
The United States Government points out that it does
not concede and has not conceded that the IL—12 whose
destruction the United States Government was the ﬁrst to
announce on July 27, 1953, ﬁve days before the Soviet
Government made any announcement or claim on the
subject, was the same airplane to which the Soviet Gov-
ernment’s notes of July 31, 1953,‘ and August 11, 1953.’
refer, nor does it have any independent information in
respect to the destruction, whether by firing or otherwise,
of any 11,-12 aircraft within Manchuria or elsewhere
than in North Korea, on or about July 27, 1953. In this
regard the United States Government reiterates its request
that the Soviet Government state speciﬁcally whether any
aircraft, belonging to it or to any other government or
organization to its knowledge, of an III-12 type, whether
carrying passengers or cargo, or neither, was destroyed or
damaged in the area of North Korea on July 27, 1953, or
at any date in the proximity of July 27, 1953.
The note points out that while the United States
Government’s investigation of evidence available
to it demonstrates that the only IL—12 aircraft
destroyed by an American aircraft on July 27,
1953 (the last day of the Korean hostilities), of
which the United States Government is aware,
occurred entirely within North Korea and that no
such action took place in Manchuria as the Soviet
Government claims; nevertheless the United States
Government prefers to make a deﬁnitive answer to
the Soviet Government’s claim to its note of July
31 based on a consideration of the evidence which
the Soviet Government allegedly examined in
Manchuria. The note states further:
The policy of the United States Government, as is well
known, is to further the settlement of international dis-
putes by the procedures of international law and order and
in accordance with the established practices of diplomacy,
and to encourage other governments to pursue the same
policy and practices in their relations with the United
States Government and among themselves. If the ap-
plicable law and the established facts, upon the issues
raised by the exchange of notes in this matter, demonstrate
that the United States Government is under any obligation
to the Soviet Government, the United States Government
is prepared to recognize and meet that obligation in ac-
cordance with the established rules of international law
and the international practices common among peace-
loving and law-abiding governments.
In consequence of the foregoing, the United States Gov-
ernment, reserving its ﬁnal decision as to its liability, if
any, and the extent thereof, requests the Soviet Govern-
ment to supply the United States Government with the
following information which the Soviet Government has
indicated is in its possession or is available to it and which
is necessary in order that the United States Government
may reach a determination of its own liability, if any, to
the Soviet Government in the premises.
