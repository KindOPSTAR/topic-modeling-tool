I have authorized Gen. Timberman to make
contact with Mr. Dengin and to transmit to him
a proposal dealing with the other restrictions
which we wish to see eliminated in Berlin.
General ‘I'lmberrnan to Mr. Dengln, February 22
In his letter of February 22 the United States
High Commissioner has drawn Mr. Semenov’s at-
tention to the necessity of re-establishing more
normal living conditions for the inhabitants of the
city of Berlin. In particular he has expressed the
desire that the four occupying powers should
reach agreement on the removal of impediments to
the freedom of movement of ersons and goods be-
tween the Western scctors 0 Berlin and \Vestcrn
Germany and on the abolition of all formalities
re the movement of persons between Berlin and
the Soviet Zone.
In the same spirit and in order to eliminate all
restrictions on freedom of communications be-
tween the four sectors of Berlin, I request ou to
agree that the following measures should put
into eﬁect:
A. The abolition of police controls at the bor-
ders and of other forms of hindrance to the com-
plete freedom of movement of persons throughout
the cit .
B. 'Izhe removal of all street barriers between
sectors.
C. The re-establishment of direct tram services
throughout the cit .
D. The re-establishment of the automatic city-
wide telephone service.
E. The re-establishment of reliable and efﬁcient
postal services throughout the city.
F. The abolition of controls over and inter-
ference with the free circulation of printed mat-
ter, ﬁlms and other cultural media throughout the
city.
I am convinced that an agreement should be
reached on these different roposals for the com-
mon good of the (people ofp Berlin and am ready,
for my part, to isouss with you without delay
all the measures required to put them into force.
Should technical discussions be required con-
cerning proposals C and D above, I am prepared
to furnish the names of the German technicians
authorized to deal with these matters for my sector
and would be glad to receive similar information
from you.
Mr. Semsnov to Ambassador Conant, March 6
[Translation]
In acknowledgment of your letter of February
22, 1954 containing a proposal that the High Com-
missioners of the Four Powers in Germany ex-
amine certain problems concerning movement of
the German population and goods across the
demarcation line between Western and Eastern
Germany, economic and cultural and relations
between the two parts of Germany, and other
uestions, I deem it necessary to state the
ollowing:
In the relations between Eastern and Western
Germany there are a number of important prob-
lems the solution of which is an urgent matter
for the German peo le who are interested in the
bringing together 0 Western and Eastern Ger-
man , 1n the develo ment of economic and cul-
tural' ties between he German Democratic Re-
public and German Federal Re ublic.
Taking this into account, at t e Berlin Confer-
ence of the four Foreign Ministers, after it had
been made clear that it was impossible to effect
agreement between the positions of the confer-
ence participants on basic questions regarding
the uniﬁcation of Germany and the conclusion
of a eace treaty, the Soviet Government sub-
mitted) for the consideration of the conference a
proposal to recommend to the appropriate organs
of Eastern and \Vestern Germany the following: ‘
l. The creation of an all-German committee
with the functions of eﬂ'ectin agreement and
coordination in the spheres o trade, ﬁnancial
settlements, transport, frontier and other ques-
tions concerned with economic relations;
2. The creation of an all-German committee
on problems of the development of cultural, sci-
entiﬁc, and sport relations with the View of elim-
inating existlng obstacles to the development of
German national culture.
The creation of such all-German committees
would best facilitate a solution of urgent internal
German problems, since the settlement of these
problems is the internal affair of the German
peo le themselves.
T ere can be no denial of the great signiﬁcance
for the populations of both parts of Germany of
the uestions referred to in your letter as well
as 0 other practical uestions in the relations
between Eastern and estern Germany. All-
German committees could immediately decide
such internal German uestions in the interests
of the populations of bot arts of Germany with-
out the mterfcrence of t e occupation powers.
Problems relating to the situation 1n Berlin could
also be examined and decided by German
authorities.
The establishment of the above-mentioned all-
German committees would serve as an im rtant
contribution to the bringing together of estern
and Eastern Germany and would facilitate the
creation of conditions favorable for the uniﬁca-
tion of Germany.
The government of the German Democratic
Republic has ofﬁcially stated that it is agreeable
to the immediate launching of negotiations for
the creation of all-German committees. The
Soviet authorities for their part are ready to give
