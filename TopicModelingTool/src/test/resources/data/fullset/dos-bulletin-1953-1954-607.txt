future development. In particular, he singled out
the tendency of the Council of the Oas to become
absorbed in trivia and to avoid matters of sub-
stance, a trend which was at times evidenced dur-
ing the preparatory period for the Tenth Con-
ference. The address aved the way for one of
the more important reso utions to emerge from the
Caracas meeting: Resolution XLVI entitled “Mat-
ters Assigned to the Council of the Organization
of American ' States.” The resolution, based
largely on suggestions which was proposed b the
Umted States, is designed to strengthen the un-
cil as the permanent executive body of the Organi-
zation by speciﬁcally assigning to it several
important functions.
Consideration was also given by the Conference
to the functioning and composition of two other
organs: the Inter-American J uridical Committee
and the Committee for Cultural Action. Follow-
ing the recommendation of the Council of J urists,
the Conference decided that the J uridical Com-
mittee should hold annual sessions for a ﬁxed pe-
riod of time (3 months) and that it should, as ap-
propriate, make greater use of the Department of
International Law of the Pan American Union
in furnishing background material and preparing
preliminary studies. The Conference rejected the
concept that the members of the Committee should
have no other duties than those pertaining to the
Committee, but did recognize that it was essential
that they devote themselves exclusively to the
work of the Committee while it is in session. The
following nine countries were selected to member-
ship in t e J uridical Committee: Argentina Bra-
zil, Chile, Colombia, Dominican Republic, 1M’exico,
Peru, United States, and Venezuela. The Con-
ference did not enter into a detailed study of the
functioning of the Cultural Action Committee,
limitmg its action to entrusting such a study to the
Counci of the OAS in consultation with the Inter-
American Cultural Council and to establishing
Mexico City as the seat of the Committee. Brazil,
Cuba, Haiti, Mexico, and the United States were
elected to membership in the Committee.
In other decisions on organizational matters the
Conference revised the Statute of the Inter-
American Commission of Women, adopted several
resolutions relating to the civil, political, and eco-
nomic rights of women, and entrusted to the Coun-
cil of the Oas the study of administrative and
ﬁscal policy of the Organization proposed by
Brazil.
Quito, Ecuador, was designated as the site for
the Eleventh Inter-American Conference, which,
in accordance with the charter of the Organiza-
tion, is to be held in 5 years.

ANNEX A
DECLARATION OF SOLIDARITY FOR THE PRESER-
VATION OF THE POLITICAL INTEGRITY OF THE
AMERICAN STATES AGAINST INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNIST INTERVENTION
anas:
The American republics at the Ninth International
Conference of American States declared that international
communism, by its anti-democratic nature and its inter-
ventionist tendency, is incompatible with the concept of
American freedom, and resolved to adopt within their
respective territories the measures necessary to eradicate
and prevent subversive activities; ‘
The Fourth Meeting of Consultation of Ministers of
Foreign Affairs recogniZed that, in addition to adequate
internal measures in each state, a high degree of inter-
national cooperation is required to eradicate the danger
which the subversive activities of international commu-
nism pose for the American States; and
The aggressive character of the international communist
movement continues to constitute, in the context of world
affairs, a special and immediate threat to the national
institutions and the peace and security of the American
States, and to the right of each State to develop its cul-
tural, political, and economic life freely and naturally
without intervention in its internal or external affairs
by other States,

The activities of the international communist movement

nist movement, extending to this hemisphere the political
system of an extracontinental power, would constitute a

would call for a meeting of consultation to consider the
adoption of appropriate action in accordance with exist-
ing treaties.

That without prejudice to such other measures as they
may consider desirable special attention be given by each
of the American governments to the following steps for

spective jurisdictions:
1. Measures to require disclosure of the identity, ac-
tivities, and sources of funds, of those who are spreading
propaganda of the international communist movement
or who travel in the interests of that movement, and of
those who act as its agents or in its behalf; and
2. The exchange of information among governments to
assist in fulﬁlling the purpose of the resolutions adopted
by the Inter-American Conferences and Meetings of Min-
isters of Foreign Affairs regarding international
