Section VII—Agriculture, Forestry, and
Fisheries
Owing to bad weather which caused consider-
able damage to crops and generally hampered
ﬁeld work, the year 1952 was a poor one for agri-
culture. The crop harvest was 30 er cent below
normal and livestock prices remained at a low
level. In spite of a shortage of fodder, the inci-
dence of disease amon cattle was not, however,
exceptional. The totafvalue of agricultural ro-
duction, including livestock, was estimate at
1,900 million lire against 2,300 million lire in
1951.
Progress was made in land reclamation and re-
afforestation projects, and, in addition, the
Allied Military Government contributed 66 mil-
lion lire, representing about one-third of the total
cost of 414 land improvement projects. Agri-
cultural training courses and experimental work
continued normally, and grants were made for
the purchase of concentrated cattle feed, plants,
and farm machinery, as well as for the importa-
tion of edigree cattle.
The sh catch at 3.8 million kgs. was some 5
per cent lower than in 1951, and exports fell by
about 10 per cent.

L EDUCATION
The new school year opened on 7 October 1952
with 31,785 pu ils attending the various statal
schools in the one, an increase of 439 over the
attendance for the previous year. In spite of a
slight improvement in the number of class rooms
available, the shortage which has persisted since
the war still necessitated the organization of
morning and afternoon shifts in many of the
schools. Free school lunches continued to be
provided to needy pupils in the elementary and
training schools. Those assisted in this way dur-
ing the 1951/1952 school year numbered 3,427 in
the Italian, and 1,384 in the Slovene language
schools. During the summer, about 7,000 school
children spent a month’s holiday in the mountains
or by the sea. The number would have been
greater but for an outbreak of scarlet fever which
necessitated the curtailing of the programme at
a number of the camps. The kindergartens, of
which there are 48 distributed throughout the
Zone, continued to function normally.
The new academic year was inaugurated at
Trieste University on 16 November with 2,124
undergraduates inscribed in the various faculties.
This compares with 2,638 who attended courses
durin the year 1951/1952. A new school for
specia ists in Labour and Social Security Legis-
lation was added to the faculty of law.
2. PUILIC HEALTH
The general standard of health in the Zone dur-
ing 1952 was satisfactory. Mild epidemics of
measles and scarlet fever which developed during
the year gave no cause for alarm. The anti-
tuberculosis campaign continued to give encour-
aging results, 574 new cases being re orted com-
pared with 692 in 1951. There is sti 1, however,
much to be done in this ﬁeld. Both the birth and
death rates, at respectively 9.45 and 11.36 per
thousand inhabitants, were slightly lower than
in 1951. Work on the new 400 bed sanitorium in
Trieste continued. Completion of this hospital
will release badly needed beds in other hospitals
which in the post-war period have had temporarily
to be ut at the disposal of tubercular atients.
During the year a new Institute for natomy
and Pathology was established in Trieste General
Hos ital, and 180 million lire was a pro riated
by tie Allied Military Government or t e cre-
ation of a Centre for the Diagnosis and Treatment
of Cancer, designed to provide free treatment for
those who are unable to pay.
A valuable contribution to the improvement of
the Zone’s health services was made by the World
Health Organization, which put at the disposal of
the Allied Military Government seven scholar-
ships to enable local doctors to attend university
clinics in the United Kingdom, United States,
France and Germany.
The incidence of infectious diseases is shown
at Appendix K.
I. SOCIAL ASSISTANCE
Expenditure for relief and social services again
increased in 1952. Public assistance in its various
forms cost 1,623 million lire, compared with 1,483
million lire in 1951. The increase was partly due
to salary increases granted to the personnel of the
various agencies concerned, but for the most part
to a revision of invalid and old age pensions, and
to an increase in the number of families requiring
direct ﬁnancial assistance.
During the winter 1951/1952 42 million lire was
again distributed by the Winter Relief Fund Com-
mittee to needy families.
During the latter part of the year, with the
collaboration of two experts loaned by the United
Nations Organization, the Allied Military Gov-
ernment initiated a comprehensive study of the
organization of social assistance in the Zone.
When completed, this study should enable a more
rational approach to be made to the problem.
