the most noble of causes—to protect the weak from

continue to be willing to band together for this

Soviet Rejection of Collectlve Securlty
What the Soviet Union through its delegate, is
telling the world from Geneva 18 that it rejects
the principle of collective security, that it intends
to do as it pleases without regard to truth or jus-
tice or peace—even without regard to the funda-
mental rights of humanity. It is as simple as
that and it should cause the majority of us to
think and to draw closer together.
It is a strange phenomenon that we who came
here to unite a divided and war-torn nation ﬁnd
ourselves defending the international system of
security to which every one of the governments of
the world, if it were truly representative of the
wishes of its people, would be eager to contribute
all possible mora and material su port.
This system was established in 1945 at San
Francisco. It is embodied in the United Nations
Charter, to which the representative of the Soviet
Union at this Conference aﬂixed his own si a-
ture. That charter was, and still is, re arde by
the vast majority of us as the world’sﬁiest hope
for peace.
One of the basic pledges in the United Nations
Charter is the pled to resist aggression. A
s eciﬁc case arose in une 1950, when armies from
orth Korea invaded the territo of the Republic
of Korea, which had been forma I recognized by
the United Nations as the only lega government in
Korea. The Security Council of the United Na-
tions was promptly called into session. It called
upon its members to act at once to repel this
aggression.
The re resentative of the Soviet Union in the
Security ouncil absented himself on the occasions
of these historic decisions. The Soviet delegate
has sought here, and not for the ﬁrst time, to
establish the theory that one absent member is
more potent under law than ten who are present
and w 0 vote to take a united action.
If one absent member, throu h the mere circum-
stance of his absence, can ren er the o ration of
the principle of collective security nul and void,
or “illegal and shameful,” to use the words of our
Communist colleagues, the aggressor in Korea
would have swept the entire country unimpeded—
and all because the re resentative of the Soviet
Union in the Security ouncil of the United Na-
tions had gone for a walk. I am not attempting to
be sarcastic. I am simply stating a fact.
We are presented here with the paradox that
the Soviet Union, while denouncin the acts of
the United Nations, insists neverthe ess on exer-
cising all the rights and privileges of a member
and, indeed, goes further by continuously usin
its veto to keep sovereign and independent and
law-abiding nations from being admitted to mem-
bership in the United Nations. More than that,
the Soviet Union has been insisting that the gov-
ernment in Pei ing, so far lawless, shall be seated
in the United ations.
This brings to mind the circumstances that sur-
round the presence here of the Chinese Commu-
nist representative. We cannot forget that in the
autumn of 1950 when the armed forces of the
United Nations had successfully repelled the ag-
gressor armies of the North Korean faction, there
came another aggression. At ﬁrst it was insisted
at Peiping that the well-or anized and well-
equipped armies from the main and of China were
merely “Chinese volunteers” and had no connec-
tion with the Pei ing government.
Then the worl was told after a few months
that the government at Peiping acknowled ed re-
sponsibility for the orders to the armies of hinese
soldiers in Korea. Today at this Conference in
Geneva that same government, through its repre-
sentative here, tells us that the United Nations has
no right to see to it that the Chinese armies now
occupying North Korea will not break the peace
again. We are told also by the Soviet Govern-
ment that the United Nations must not be per-
mitted to supervise the elections proposed for all
Korea. Why does the Soviet Government object
so vigorously to the conduct of free elections under
United Nations observation, and why did it object
in May 1948 to the superwsion by a United Na-
tions commission of the elections in North Korea?
Is the Soviet Government afraid of the votes of
the eople of Korea in a free, uncoerced election?
ow let us look at the record of the members
of the United Nations who, faithful to the charter,
sent their armed forces to Korea to repel aggres-
sion. They sent their troops thousands of miles
away from home and they made sacriﬁces of al-
most 200,000 killed and wounded in order to sup-
port the principle of collective security as a ainst
a gression—the great objective of the United
ations Charter. They did this only in the inter-
est of achieving peace against aggression. No
more dramatic demonstration has ever been given
to the world of the collective action of sovereign
states in repellin aggression.
Yet after all t is, we have been ex osed to a
brazen effort to distort the facts, a evious, if
all too obvious, attempt to pervert an inspiring
moral principle. But I wil not dwell further
on this point. The United States did not come
to Geneva to lend itself to the destruction of the
United Nations.
Here at Geneva we have been confronted by a
new challenge to our wisdom, vision, and generos-
ity. We have the opportunity to put aside sus-
picions and antagonisms in a united effort to allow
the Korean people at long last to work out their
national destiny. We have the opportunity to in-
