statement by our eminent colleague is well known
to all of us.
Have any of my colleagues forgotten the pact
between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany dated
Au st 23, 1939?1 Probably at one time Mr.
M0 otov considered this pact a diplomatic achieve~
ment. But I’m sure he must later have shared
with the rest of us the bitter conviction that it
paved the way ﬁrst for the Nazi victories of the
early years of World War II and then for the
Nazi assault on the Soviet Union which cost the
grave, long-suffering, and wholly admirable Rus-
sian peop e so many millions of lives and such
widespread destruction.
I have examined this pact and particularly the
secret annex thereto, which has since been revealed,
and I remain deeply impressed b the followin
words from the second numbere paragraph 0
this annex to which Mr. Molotov appended his
signature on August 23, 1939.
They read as follows:
The question of whether the interests of both parties
make desirable the maintenance of an independent Polish
state and how such state should be bounded can only be
deﬁnitely determined in the course of further political
developments. In any event both Governments will re-
solve this question by means of a friendly agreement.
No attempts to justify this international im-
morality on the ground of exigencies existing at
the time can possibly be acce table. And read in
the light of this paragraph, t e history of Eastern
Europe between 1939, when Poland was destroyed,
and 1948, when Czechoslovakia lost her proud
place as a free nation, becomes unmistakably clear.
The national aspirations of small, weak countries
are to be subject to what is called the “interests” of
large aggressive powers with designs of world
domination. What took place in Poland, Latvia,
Lithuania, Estonia, Hungary, Rumania, Bulgaria,
Albania, and Czechoslovakia constitutes in each
case a chapter in the Soviet record.
It now begins to appear that one of the next
chapters in this record may reveal an intention to
subordinate the national aspirations of the people
of Indochina to what has been termed the “inter-
ests of both parties” as they may be represented by
the treaty relationship between the Soviet Union
and Communist China.
I should like at this point to bring to your at-
tention another interesting quotation which will
be familiar to Mr. Chou En-lai : “Truce is the mil-
itary counterpart of the political tactic of coalition
government. It is the means to an end, not the
ultimate objective.” In these words our colleague,
the Foreign Minister of Communist China, gave
to the familiar military truce a meaning entirely
new in the history of war. That meaning was
spelled out in a war of aggression in Korea and the
' Nazi-Soviet Relations 1989—1941 (Department of State
publication 3023), p. 76.
same concept han over the battleﬁelds of Indo-
china and it will e understood that it is for this
reason, among others, that the majority of us
have insisted on deﬁnite understandings regard-
ing some of the vital issues that we are considering
in our effort to bring peace in Southeast Asia.
Our objective and our hope are peace and secur-
ity. Mr. Molotov himself will recall that at our
ﬁrst formal conference in Moscow in 1946 I stated
that the vital question in the mind of the entire
free world was, “How much further is the Soviet
Union oing to go?”
I sai also at that time that, if the aggressive
expansionism which the Soviet Union had alread
demonstrated were to continue, the free worl ,
purely in self-defense, would if necessary draw
closer together.
The repressive effect of Soviet armed might was
not so soon felt in South or Southeast Asna as it
was in Eastern Europe. Consequently, therefor
we saw, since the end of the last war, the peoples 0
this area make giant strides in attaining inde-
endence and the control of their own destinies.
urma, Ceylon, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and
the Philippines have taken their places in the
family of free nations. These developments have
been viewed with the greatest satisfaction by the
people of my country.
Cambodia, Laos, and Viet-Nam have more re-
cently joined the other free South and Southeast
Asian nations in the achievement of independence,
and it is our sincere hope that they will attain peace
and security based on a true res ect for the na-
tional aspirations of their peop es. Those na-
tional aspirations should not be subordinated, as
has occurred in the case of the unfortunate nations
mentioned at the beginning of this statement, to
the interests of a large a gressive power or powers.
The Soviet Union t ay is the great Asmn im-
perial power, holding vast colonial territories in
the Caucasus and Central Asia. The solicitude I
have heard expressed by Mr. Molotov for the
people of Southeast Asia ap arently does not ex-
ten toward the Armenians,t eKazakhs, Mon 01s,
and I think it mi ht be worth the while of a1 m
colleagues to reca l the circumstances under whic
the former small independent state of Tanatuva
disappeared completely from the map.
I might say also to Mr. Pham Van Dong that
accusations against the U.S. of aggressive inten-
tions and imperialist designs come rather strangely
from his lips when we recall that the troops of
the Viet Minh have invaded the peaceful coun-
tries of Cambodia and Laos and have spread death
and destruction there.
But, Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, I intensely
dislike these charges and countercharges. I have,
so far, refrained from replying myself because of
the really serious and important business facing
this conference.
Having now recorded my testimony with regard
to the matter of imperialism, I should like to re-
