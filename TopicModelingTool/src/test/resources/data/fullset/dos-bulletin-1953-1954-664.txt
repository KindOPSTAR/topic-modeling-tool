Bulldlng a Cooperative Peace Through International Understanding
Address by the President 1
Ei ht years ago—almost to the day—I addressed
the ureau of Advertising [of the American
Newspaper Publishers Association]. At that
moment, the horror of war was a bitter memory of
the recent past. A revulsion against war or any
reminder of war possessed our people. The at-
mosphere was charged with emotionalism that
could have destroyed our military strength.
Fortunately, our newspapers did not then permit
us, nor are they now ermitting us, to forget the
ever-present reality 0? aggressive threat.
Aggression is still a terrible reality, though on
all the continents and the islands of the earth,
mankind hungers for peace. This universal hun-
ger must be satisﬁed.
Either the nations will build a cooperative peace
or, one by one, they will be forced to accept an
imposed peace, now sought by the Communist
powers, as it was by Hitler.
But free men still possess the greater portion of
the globe’s resources and of the potential power
to be roduced from those resources. They os-
sess scientiﬁc skill, intellectual capacity, and s eer
numbers in excess of those available to the Com-
munist world. Cons uentl , free men can have
a cooperative peace, if wit hearts and minds
cleansed of fear and doubt, together they dedicate
themselves to it in unity and in understanding and
in strength.
It is urgent that we try to clarify our thinking
about the prospect. Let us start with our own
present pos1tion. This Nation is a marvel of pro-
duction, rich in total wealth and individual earn-
in ; powerful in a unique combination of scien-
tiﬁc, military, economic, and moral strength. For
generations our country has been free from the
devastation of war in her homeland and is blessed
with staunch and friendly neighbors. \Ve covet
no nation’s possessions. We seek only the friend-
ship of others. We are eager to repay this price-
less gift in the same coin.
Surely, the United States, by all the standards
of history, should possess a genuine peace and
tranquility.

But our Nation today is not truly tranquil. We,
her people, face a grave dan er which, in essence
at least, all of us understan . This danger, this
peril calls for two far-reaching policies or ur-
poses behind which all in our country should be
solidly united. They are:
First: All our efforts must be bent to the
strengthening of America in dedication to libert ,
in knowledge and in comprehension, in a depen -
able prosperity widely shared, and in an adequate
military posture.
Second: This strength—all of it—must be de-
voted to the building of a cooperative peace among
men.
Now these are the ﬁxed purposes of the vast
majority of our people. But in a world of ideo-
lo 'cal division, com etitive rivalry, turbulent
crisis in one place and) political upheaval in an-
other, their achievement demands far more than
good intentions or lowing words.
If we are to bui d and maintain the strength
required to cope with the problems of this age,
we must cooperate one with the other, every sec-
tion with all others, each up with its neighbors.
This means domestic unity, about which I talk
incessantly. Unity does not imply rigid conform-
ity to every doctrine or position of a particular
olitical ﬁgure. But it does require a common
devotion to the cardinal principles of our free sys-
tem, shared knowledge and understanding of our
own capacities and opportunities, and a common
determination to cooperate unreservedly in striv-
ing toward our truly important goals. This type
of unity is the true source of our t energy—
our spiritual, intellectual, materia , and creative
energy.
Furthermore, our ple, strong and united
must cooperate with 0t er nations in helping build
a cooperative peace. Such cooperation requires
the American ple to increase their understand-
ing of their is low men around the globe. Like-
wise, the nations be 0nd our shores must come to
understand better t e American people—particu-
larly our ho and our purposes. And, because of
the relative y greater stake we have in'world sta-
bility, because history has decreed that respon-
