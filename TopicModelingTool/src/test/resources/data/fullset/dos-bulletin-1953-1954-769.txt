regime. Two weeks before Christmas in 1946—
almost 4 years before the new penal code was
proposed—Agaij was arrested by the Albanian
political police. He was accused of passing on
to others news broadcasts by the British Broad-
casting Corporation, dissemination of propaganda
against the government, contacts with reaction-
aries.
Then came the sham trial, the futile rotesta-
tions of innocence, the imprisonment, t e trans-
fer to a labor camp in the district of Tirana, and
then another transfer to the Vlodishti camp in the
Korea District where existence became a night-
mare. Windowless barracks, in which the doors
remained open summer and heatless winter, and
on the ﬂoors on which exhausted men sle t
crowded shoulder to shoulder. Sanitary faci i-
ties? The camp’s 1,400 forced laborers shared
three toilets, drew water for washing and drink-
ing from a Single fountain. Not once in a span of
12 months was the camp disinfected. Between
the 1,400 forced laborers and mass contagion stood
three doctors—convicts, too. Their medicine chest
consisted solel of atebrin, which they could not
administer wit out approval of the camp authori-
ties. The work day began at 5 a. m. after a
meager breakfast of bread and bitter synthetic
tea, and ended at 6 p. m. Each laborer was
gEwoaded to fulﬁll the camp norm of ditch digging.
ailure meant reduction of the mean ration and
physical punishment. In less than one year 140
inmates ﬁnished their “education” and were freed
from the camp—by death.
Let me now turn to China—the mainland dom-
inated by the Communists.
Rod China's Advocacy of Forced Labor
Perhaps the blandest acknowledgement that the
Communist regime in China is employing forced
labor came from Lo Jui-ch’ing, Mimster of
Public Security, in an article ublished in the
Peiping Jen Min Jih Pao. T e article, titled
“The Mighty Movement for the Sup ression of
Counter-Revolutionaries,” acknowledges in a
single paragraph that forced labor is used to
liquidate and reform enemies of the Peiping
regime, and that it—forced labor—is of great
economic as well as political signiﬁcance.
I read you that paragraph:
The subjection of counter-revolutionaries to forced
labor is an indispensable means for the liquidation of
the counter-revolutionary class, as well as a basic policy
for the thorough reform of the culprits into new human
beings. This sort of reform is a combination of political
reform coupled with labor reform, as well as a com-
bination of punishment and education. . . . It is up to
all levels of people‘s governments and various public
security organs to pay adequate attention to and to
make a success of this aspect of work which is pos-
sessed of the greatest political and economic signiﬁcance.
In that same article L0 stated that—and I
quote—“large numbers had been sentenced to
prison terms and subjected to compulsory reform
through labor.”
Chinese Communist advocacy of forced labor
goes back to the very beginning of that regime.
Communist chairman Mao Tse-tung, in the earl
days, gave a speech in which he made it explicit
that he intended, as he put it, “to re-educate the
reactionary classes anew through work.” He
added: “1f the are unwilling to work, the
people’s state wil com el them to work.”
I quote another hinese Communist leader,
Premier Chou En-lai.
At the third session of the National Political
Consultative Conference he reported:
In compliance with the directives of Chairman Mao
(Tse-tung) . . . we have decided that to those who have
“blood debts" or those counter-revolutionary elements
who have inﬂicted serious damages to the national inter-
ests, we must hand down the death sentence and have
them executed. To those who deserve the death sen-
tence but who have no “blood debt" or inﬂicted less seri-
ous damages to national interests, we would still hand
down the death sentence but Would have their execution
deferred for a period of two years, during which they
would do forced labor on probation.
The meaning of that statement is clear. It is a
naked use of the death threat to exact forced labor
to the utmost.
These quotations will convince any person with
an open mind that the Communist regime in China
has plainly stated its intention to use forced la-
bor—and has told the world why and how it
would use it.
That it has been used is proved by a report on
the work of the Kwangtung Provincial People’s
Government for a 10-month period. Ku Ta-
Chuan, vice governor of Kwangtung Province,
said that 1,571 cases of what he called counter-
revolutionary attempts were exposed, involving
the arrest of nearly 90,000 persons. Of this num-
ber, he said, some 28,000 were shot and the re-
inglnder were sentenced to reform through hard
a or.
It was in a camp for such “reform” that Li 0-
Shen, former secretary of Dr. Sun Yat- en,
perished. Too ill to take boiled rice in a camp
that made no provision for medical aid, he tried
to get rice water instead. For this he was beaten
until he collapsed and the same evening he died,
“uneducated” to the end of his 60-odd years.
I should like to refer brieﬂy to another account
of Chinese toil on the mainland, by Brajkishore
Shastri a prominent member of the Praja So-
cialist Party of India who visited Communist
China last April and May. His im ressions of
a 6-weeks stay in China were publishe in Bombay
in Janata, the Praja Socialist Party weekly.
Tellin of his visit to the Yangtse River Valley
Project, e said:
About 5,000 laborers were at work. Every piece of
work, from breaking stones, cutting a tunnel, or removing
rocks, was being done by man’s bare hands. The meager
implements the laborers were using were like museum
pieces. As soon as we got out of our omnibus, we were
