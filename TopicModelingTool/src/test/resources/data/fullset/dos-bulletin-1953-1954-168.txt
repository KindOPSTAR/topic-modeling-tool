strengthening the United Nations, diﬂ'erence of
opinion about how to do this should not then be
pressed to a point such that the Review Confer-
ence would result in undermining the United Na-
tions or disrupting it. The United Nations as it
is, is better than no United Nations at all.
It must be borne in mind that, under the pres-
ent charter, each of the permanent members of
the Security Council has a “veto” on amendments
which the General Review Conference may pro-
pose. The existence of this veto does not mean
that the Review Conference is a futilit . At San
Francisco each of the nations which ad 'oined
to draft the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals ad a
“veto” over changes from these roposals. Never—
theless, they did not exercise t at veto as against
chan es which were clearly reasonable and de-
manded b world opinion. We can hope that the
same con itions Will revail at the respective
Review Conference. e can reasonab y make our
plans on the working h othesis that no one na-
tion will, in fact, be alie arbitrarily to impose
changes or to veto changes.
Let me end b reasserting my continuing faith
in the United i ations. I fully share the View ex-
pressed by the Senate in its resolution of June 11,
1948, that it is “the policy of the United States
to achieve international peace and security through
the United Nations.” As President Eisenhower
said to the Congress on January 7, 1954, “The
United Nations deserves our continued and ﬁrm
support.”
I believe that it lies within our power to advance
the at objective of the United Nations ro-
vide we are patient, resourceful, and reso ute,
and inspired by faith that man has the capacity
to overcome em] with good.

Report on Trade Agreement Escape Clauses
(Pursuant to the Provisions of Sec. 6‘ (b) o
the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951
Section 6 of the Trade Agreements Extension
Act of 1951 reads as follows:
(a) No reduction in any rate of duty, or binding of
any existing customs or excise treatment. or other
concession hereafter proclaimed under section 350 of the
Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, shall be permitted to
continue in effect when the product on which the con-
cession has been granted is. as a result, in whole or in
part. of the duty or other customs treatment reﬂecting
such concession, being imported into the United States
in such increased quantities, either actual or relative.
as to cause or threaten serious injury to the domestic
industry producing like or directly competitive products.
(b) The President, as soon as practicable, shall take
such action as may be necessary to bring trade agree-
ments heretofore entered into under section 850 of
the Tariﬂ Act of 1930, as amended, into conformity
with the policy established in subsection (a) of this
section.
On or before January 10. 1952, and every six months
thereafter, the President shall report to the Congress
on the action taken by him under this subsection.
As indicated in previous reports, escape clauses
com lying with the uirements of section 6 of
the ade Agreements xtension Act of 1951 have
been included in all trade a ements concluded
under the act except those With Ecuador, El Sal-
vador, Guatemala, and Honduras.
As regards Ecuador, the previous reports re~
ferred to discussions in rogress between the Gov-
ernment of the United tates and the Government
of Ecuador with regard to the existing trade
agreement, includin the possibility of inserting
an esca clause in t e agreement. The Govern-
ment 0 Ecuador has been informed that it would
be necessary to amend the trade agreement to
include an esca clause. The discuions with
Ecuador are stil in progress.
With regard to the trade agreements with the
Governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and
Honduras, there has been no change in the situa-
tion in the last 6 months and, for the reasons given
in the report of July 10, 1952,’ no further action
with re rd to insertion of the escape clause has
been ta en.
