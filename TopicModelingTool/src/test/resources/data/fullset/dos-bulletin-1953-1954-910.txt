cascades will continue to run full of water and
that the level of Lake Erie will remain unaffected.
And this structure is the means by which the
ﬂow of water over the falls will be regulated.
Only by regulation of ﬂow can we obtain more,
badly needed power from this mighty natural re-
source without impairin its beauty.
The excavation and ﬁﬁ are designed to preserve
and enhance the Horseshoe Falls. Up to now, the
scouring action of the water has been concentrated
in deep and receding notches, near the center of
the great curve. The deeper the notch is worn, the
' lon er the rim over which the water must pour,
an the thinner the rush of the cataract. In time,
the constant cutting away at this point would
continue the recess10n of the waterfall, which
scientists tell us, has already moved backward
several miles during past centuries.
The engineers considered several plans for rem-
edying this situation. They decided it would be
best to excavate some 64,000 cubic yards of rock
from the Canadian ﬂank of the Horseshoe and
about 24,000 cubic yards from the Goat Island
ﬂank. These excavations will tap the ﬂow of the
deep portion of the stream and carry water toward
the ends of the falls adjacent to the banks. Care-
ful and exhaustive model studies proved this to be
the most feasible, durable, and economical solution
of the roblem.
Fina ly, the engineers sought some means of
shortening the length of the arc itself, so that the
water would have less room in which to spread
out and hence would ﬂow more copiously at all
points along the world-famous curtain of the
falls. Hence they pro ose to ﬁll in areas at the
two ends of the Horses oe with rock, which will
be landscaped to blend into the natural formation
of the gorge and which will be placed where it
will eliminate destructive and water-wasting leaks.
From these ﬁlled-in promontories, visitors will be
able to view the wonder and beauty and power of
the cataract more intimately than ever before.
Speaking for the United States Army, we are
gratiﬁed that the Corps of Engineers has been
chosen to participate with the Hydro-Electric
Power Commission of Ontario in the planning and
construction of this project.
Perhaps you wonder why the United States
Army is participating in an activity as unrelated
to the military as the Niagara Falls Remedial
Project. This is just one of many civil works
projects assigned to the Corps of Engineers, which
enable the Army to keep an expert construction
force in being, doing useful work for our country
in peacetime, and able to apply its organization
and know-how instantly in the defense of the free
world if war comes.
In closing I should like to congratulate the mem-
bers of the International Joint Commission, and
the many distinguished men of both nations who
have served on engineering boards and who have
in other ways taken part in the development of
this Project, and the statesmen who, through un-
selﬁsh and broad-visioned negotiations, have
cleared the way for the work to begin. But even
more than these, I believe the people of Canada
and the United States are to be congratulated.
Through their ap reciation of the beauty of Ni-
agara Falls and t eir willingness to devote sub-
stantial resources to the preservation and enhance-
ment of that beauty, they are fulﬁlling their trust
to future generations, and at the same time will
derive appreciable beneﬁts for themselves.
This is true conservation. And, as a coopera-
tive undertaking, it is more—it is democracy in
action, manifesting itself across an international
boundary. There is beauty in that fact, too—
perhaps as much as in Niagara Falls itself!

Two hundred and seventy-six years ago, accord-
ing to the records, a white man ﬁrst saw Nia ara
Falls. Describing his visit of 1678, Father en-
nepin wrote:
They plunge down a height of more than ﬁve hundred
feet and its fall is composed of two sheets of water and a
cascade, with an island sloping down. In the middle these
waters foam and boil in a fearful manner.
Father Hennepin would not, perhaps, meet the
exacting requirements of modern engineers in his
estimate of the height of the 160-foot cliﬂ' below
the falls. His notes will, however, always be
valued as the ﬁrst of the many volumes that have
been written in vain attempts to record the gran-
deur of this scene in prose or poetry. The ﬁrst
visitors were e lorers, missionaries, soldiers, and
traders, in the ays when Canada was a colony of
France. They were followed, as our two countries
ew, by the casual visitors who made Niagara
alls one of the best-known tourist centers in the
world.
We who are here today are but a few of the
countless millions who have come, and who will
come, to admire and to wonder. We are fortunate
that nature has created such a spectacle, and we
are particularly fortunate that circumstances have
been so arranged that we Canadians and Ameri-
cans should share it.
The falls which Father Hennepin saw in 1678
were some distance down the river from the falls
we see today. The records show that even since
1842 the crest of the Horseshoe Falls has eroded
up-stream a distance of 385 feet. If our two coun-
tries were content to let nature take its course, the
falls which future generations would see would
be something much different than the sight which
greeted Father Hennepin, and something a good
deal less spectacular than the scene before us today.
