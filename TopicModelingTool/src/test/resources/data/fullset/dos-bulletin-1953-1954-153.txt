Pakistan Eases Income Tax
on Vlsltlng Businessmen
Businessmen visiting Pakistan now are exempt
from the Pakistan income tax if their stay does
not exceed 90 days, the Bureau of Foreign Com-
merce, U.S. Department of Commerce, reported
on January 12.
Previousl businessmen, other than ordinary
tourists, viSIting Pakistan were subject to Paki-
stan income tax after 30 days’ stay, if they acted in
an advisory or any other capacity, even though
they were paid no salary or received no other
remuneration during their stay. Pakistan income
tax is lpayable on income which accrues or is earned
in Pa istan, whether or not it is received there.
This relaxation by the Government of Pakistan
will help promote closer ties between U.S. and
Pakistan business ﬁrms, Bro said, and is a ﬁrm
indication that the Pakistan Government desires
to eliminate administrative obstacles to dealings
with foreign businessmen.
The Govcrnment of Pakistan now also exempts
all visitors from obtaining income-tax clearance
certiﬁcates if they are able to show the have not
spent more than 90 days in Pakistan uring the
current ﬁnancial year April-March).
Formerly; the exemption applied only to persons
leavin Pa istan within 30 days who had not spent
more t an a total of 60 days in that country during
the ﬁnancial year.
The income-tax exemption was made retroactive
to April 1, 1953, making possible a refund to an
employee of a New York ﬁrm in whose behalf the
American Embassy at Karachi, at the request of
the U.S. Department of Commerce, had made rep-
resentations to the Pakistan Government. Similar
cases are pending involving other American busi-
nessmen who have been assessed Pakistan income
tax after visiting that country.
The Government of Pakistan now exempts:
Any income received by an employee of a foreign enter-
prise, not engaged in any trade or business in the taxable
territories, as remuneration for services rendered by him
during the course of his stay in the taxable territories,
where such stay does not exceed in the aggregate a period
of 90 days in any year and where such remuneration is
not liable to be deducted from the income, proﬁts, and
gains chargeable under the Income-Tax Act, 1922.
Cooperation in U.S.-Cuban Industrial Relations
By Arthur Gardner, Ambassador to Cuba 1
It is a great pleasure for me to address a group
of industrialists such as this because, as your pres1-
dent has said, we meet on a common ground of
mutual understandin . The phrase “mutual un-
derstanding” has a amiliar ring because it is
the keynote of United States relations with the
Latin American Re ublics.
As you know, I ave been in your beautiful
country a comparatively short time. I know
something of our stirrin history, and I am
launched on t e project 0 learning your lan-
guage and the economic, social, and political story
of Cuba.
I have been here long enough, however, to ﬁnd
ample grounds for agreeing with the ﬁndings of
this group that greater diversiﬁcation of industry
is essential to Cuba’s progress and economic well-
being. Let me mention one very ﬁne step in that
direction—the cooperative Cuban-United States

Manufacturers of Cuba at Habana on Jan. 4.
development of kenaf ﬁber here under the point
4 program. While the growin of kenaf still
is in the ex erimental stage, it olds wonderful
promise. efore long it may rovide employ-
ment for many thousands of Cu ans in the long
months between sugar harvests. It may make
Cuba independent of far lands for sugar-sacking
material. I feel that Cuba has a valuable product
in kenaf.
There is no reason to dwell here on the ver
close historical and economic ties which we a]
know exist between my country and Cuba. We
see this on all sides—in harmonious political
relations, voluminous bilateral trade, cultural in-
terchanges, and an astounding volume of tourist
travel back and forth between our countries. We
read it in cold statistics and we feel it, too, as
mutually sympathetic brothers in the family of
free nations. Somehow we seem to think alike
and act alike, and this is particularly vital today
in the face of a world crisis.
The world has seen the enormous burden that
