was already resisting an armed assault. We did
so at the request of the Republic of Korea and
under a United Nations mandate. The Korean
people were inspired by a deep sense of patriotism
and eager to develop a power of their own. The
issues were clariﬁed before the world by decisions
of the United Nations. Under these circum-
stances, we and our allies fought until the enemy
sued for an armistice.
In Indochina, the situation is far more complex.
The resent conditions there do not provide a
suita 1e basis for the United States to participate
with its armed forces.
The situation ma perhaps be clariﬁed as a re-
sult of the Geneva onference. The French have
stated their desire for an armistice on honorable
terms and under proper safeguards. If they can
conclude a settlement on terms which do not en-
danger the freedom of the peoples of Viet-Nam
this would be a real contribution to the cause 0
peace in Southeast Asia. But we would be gravely
concerned if an armistice or cease-ﬁre were reached
at Geneva which would provide a road to a Com-
munist takeover and further aggression. If this
occurs, or if hostilities continue, then the need
will be even more ur ent to create the conditions
for united action in efense of the area.
In making commitments which might involve
the use of armed force, the Congress is a full
artner. Only the Congress can declare war.
resident Eisenhower has repeatedly emphasized
that he would not take military action in Indo-
china without the support of Congress. Further-
more, he has made clear that he would not seek
that unless, in his opinion, there would be an
adequate collective effort based on genuine mu-
tuality of purpose in defending vital interests.
A great effort is being made by Communist
propaganda to portray it as something evil if
Asia joins with the nations of the Americas and
Europe to get assistance which will he] the eo-
ples of Asia to secure their liberty. T ese om-
munist nations have, in this connection, adopted
the slogan “Asia for the Asians.”
The Japanese war lords adopted a similar
slogan when they sought to subject Asia to their
despotic rule. The similar theme of “Europe for
the Europeans” was adopted by Mr. Molotov at
the Berlin Conference when he proposed that the
Europeans should seek security by arrangements
which would send the United States back home.
Great despotic powers have always known that
they could impose their will and gain their con-
quests if the free nations stand apart and none
helps the other.
It should be observed that the Soviet Communist
aggression in Europe took place only against coun-
tries which had no collective security arrange-
ments. Since the organization of the North At-
lantic Treaty, there has been no successful aggres-
sion in Europe.
Of course, it is of the utmost importance that
the United States participation in creating collee
tive securit in Asia should be on a basis which
recognizes ully the aspirations and cultures of the
Asian peoples. We have a material and industrial
stren h which they lack and which is an essential
ingre ient of security. Also they have cultural
and spiritual values of their own which make them
our equals by every moral standard.
The United States, as the ﬁrst colony of modern
history to win independence for itself, instinctively
shares the aspirations for liberty of all dependent
and colonial peo les. \Ve want to help, not hinder,
the spread of ligerty.
W'e do not seek to perpetuate Western colonial-
ism and we ﬁnd even more intolerable the new im-
perialist colonialism of communism.
That is the spirit that animates us. If we re-
main true to that spirit, we can face the future
with conﬁdence that we shall be in harmony with
those moral forces which ultimately prevail.
U.S. Goals at Geneva Conference
Statement by Under Secretary Smith 1
I have been asked to give some ﬁrst impressions
of the Geneva Conference, at which I arrived a
little more than a week ago. This beautiful set-
ting of lake, river, and mountains breathes an at-
mosphere of peace. In Geneva’s streets, citizens
from scores of countries, speakin a dozen lan-
guages, pass each other without mo estation, intent
upon their lawful occasions. Yet in the council
chambers of the Palais des Nations are present the
tensions of a divided world.
We Americans do not regard the eople of any
country as our enemies. We believe that if
peoples throughout the world could make good
their dee est feelin , there would be an enduring
peace. t is in this spirit that I approach the
problems of our Conference.
We in America see clearly that our own future,
our own prospects of remaining at peace, are di-
rectly related to a basic principle—collective se-
curity. The experience of two world wars and
their aftermath, the existence of threats we can-
not ignore, have forced us to abandon our tradi—
tional aversion to military alliances.
At this Conference what we are confronted with
is not alone the restoration of a secure peace to
Korea and Indochina, for these are not isolated
or “local” problems, as some might regard them.
The signiﬁcance of Korea and Indochina is world-
wide. Powerful forces are behind the complex
inﬂuences that make these two areas the focus of
potential war for all of us, East and West.
