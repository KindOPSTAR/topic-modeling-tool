(a) As adjusted by the application of the 490 maximum.
The agreement speciﬁes that certain decisions of
the Council concerning important matters which
might involve a difference of interest between pro-
ducing countries and consuming countries would
require concurrent majorities of the producer
votes and the consumer votes, counted separately.
Other decisions of the Council would be taken by
a simple majority of votes cast.
The Council would meet at least four times a
year. Meetings would be convened at the request
of any dele ate or in the discretion of the chair-
man, as wel as in accordance with the require-
ments of the agreement. A statement showing the
tonna e of tin held by the buffer stock at the end
of eac calendar quarter would be published by
the Council not earlier than 3 months after the
end of the quarter. The Council would also pub-
lish a report of its activities in each ﬁnancial year
not earlier than 3 months after the end of that year.
lVith the consent of the Council and upon con-
ditions to be determined by it, any government
could accede to the agreement after the ﬁrst meet-
ing of the Council whether or not that govern-
ment was represented by a delegate at the 1953
session of the U. N. Conference. The agreement
requires that the conditions laid down by the
Council shall be uitable in respect of voting
rights and ﬁnancia obligations as between the
countries seeking to accede and other countries
already participating.

The stabilization operations of the International
Tin Council would try to contain the ﬂuctuations
of market prices for tin within prescribed limits.
As a basis for initial 0 erations, the agreement
provides a lower limit 0 £640 per long ton and an
up er limit of £880. These prices are equivalent
in .S. currency to 80 cents and $1.10 per pound
of tin metal.
The agreement directs the Council to consider
riodically whether these prices are ap ropriate
or the attainment of the objectives, ta ing into
account the current trends of roduction and con-
sumption, the existing capacity for production,
the adequacy of the current price to maintain
suﬂicient future productive capacity, and any other
relevant factors. The Council is authorized to
revise either or both of the price limits provided
such revision is supported by a majority of the
votes cast by producing countries and a majority
of the votes cast by consuming countries.
Establlehment ot the Butter Stock
Under the ro osed agreemen roduci
countries wouldpbepobligated to proti'idg a buﬁ'liag
stock with capital equivalent in the ag egate to
25,000 long tons of tin metal. This capital would
be placed at the disposal of the buffer stock man-
ager in the form of tin metal, tin warrants, or
cash. At least 25 percent of this mandatory con-
tribution would be made in cash. This cash would
be deemed equivalent to the quantity of metal
which it would purchase at the current ﬂoor price.
The initial contributions by producing countries
would be equivalent in the aggregate to 15,000
