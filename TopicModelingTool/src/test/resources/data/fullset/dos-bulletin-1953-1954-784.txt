What we must count on, then, is that neither
they nor we will be deterred nor deﬂected from
our common purpose. Our purposes are peaceful,
but we must not let our friends beyond the Iron
Curtain weaken in their conviction that all our
actions in their behalf are dictated by the sole
desire to hasten the advent of freedom for them
and, in the meantime, to do what is in our power
to ease their present burden.
There is one ﬁnal point. Our purpose in all our
diplomatic action is to advance the cause of free-
dom and peace. There is no quick and easy answer
to our problems. From time to time it is sug-
gested both at home and abroad that we Ameri-
cans do not have the fortitude or perseverance to
carry out the tasks we have set for ourselves and
that one day we will give up and decide to bargain
with the Soviet Union for spheres of influence,
reconciling ourselves to the captivity of the peoples
of Eastern Europe. I say ﬂatly that this is not
true. Secretary of State Dulles made our posi-
tion am 1y clear in a recent statement to the Select
House ommittee investigatin the seizure and
forced incorporation of the Ba tic countries into
the USSR. 5 He said:
The captive peoples should know that they are not
forgotten, that We are not reconciled to their fate, and,
above all, we are not prepared to seek illusory safety for
ourselves by a bargain with their masters which would
conﬁrm their captivity.
This is our olicy. It is not something that has
been shaped y expediency or considerations of
international ower politics. It is simpl areﬂec-
tion of the undamental principles 0 liberty,
decency, and freedom on which this nation is
founded.
Soviet Charges Against Austria
Press release 266 dated May 20
Followz'n is the text of an instruction from
Secretary ulles sent on May 20 to the U .S. repre-
sentative on the Allied Uouncz'l for Austria,
Charles W. Yost:
The attention of the world is concentrated pri-
marily on the Geneva conference and Indochina
at this time. Because of that, I wish to express
my strong feeling that recent events in Austria
should not go unnoticed. The preservation of the
authority of the freely elected Austrian Govern-
ment throughout Austria, in accordance with the
Allied Control Agreement, is, I believe, a matter
of serious concern to all of us who live under simi-
larly elected democratic governments.
' As you have reported, the Soviet High Commis-
smner in Austria on May 17 peremptorin sum-
moned the Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor of Aus-
tria to his headquarters and there delivered a

length and virulent condemnation of the Aus-
trian Government. This condemnation, which is
clearly without foundation, included accusations
of hostile and subversive actions against the Soviet
occupation. The accusations also included those
of failure to comply with the provisions of the
Allied Control A cement and violation of the
decisions of the llied Council. Moreover, the
Soviet High Commissioner intensiﬁed the allega-
tions, which the Soviet Foreign Minister made
ofﬁcially at the Berlin conference as an excuse for
refusing to grant Austria her long-promised inde-
pendence, of Austrian plans for remilitarization
and for an Anschluss with Germany. Perha s
most revealing of all were the charges against r.
Helmer, the Austrian Minister of the Interior, and
the threat that should the Austrian Government
fail to take corrective action, then the Soviets
themselves will be forced to take appropriate
measures.
These efforts are clearly meant to intimidate the
government of a free e0 le. The Soviets had
already made plain at er in that they intend to
remain in Austria indeﬁnitely. They are now
threatening to strengthen and expand their con-
trol in their zone of occupation. I was gratiﬁed
to note that the formal charges of the representa-
tives of the Kremlin were denied by the Chancel-
lor and Vice-Chancellor in the best tradition of
the courageous Austrian post-war Government
coalition. If there have been Austrian expressions
of dissatisfaction over the nine-year occupation
of a liberated country, sure] the Soviet Govern-
ment should ﬁnd them neit er surprising nor a
threat to its own security.
The Soviet High Commissioner gave the appear-
ance of speaking on behalf of the Allied Council.
I know of no foundation for the Soviet charges,
but in order to remove any possible Soviet mis-
understanding of the United States attitude to-
wards its latest actions, I, therefore, instruct you
to request at the next meeting of the Allied Coun-
cil consideration of the Soviet allegations and
threats. The Allied Council has not only powers
in Austria but responsibilities toward her govern-
ment and people.
Any threat of further limitation to Austrian in-
dependence is a matter of grave concern not only
to the Austrian Government but also to the other
three occupying powers. Indeed such a threat
could not but be a cause of concern to the entire
free world.
