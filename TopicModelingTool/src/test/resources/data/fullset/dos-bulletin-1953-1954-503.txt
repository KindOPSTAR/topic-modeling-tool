questions to Mr. Davies, to which Mr. Davies has
replied. On the basis of the information now at
hand, I do not ﬁnd it necessary to suspend Mr.
Davies. There are some matters bearing upon re-
liability which are susceptible of conﬂicting inter~
retations and which seem to call for clari cation
y testimony under oath by Mr. Davies and others.
In order to make this possible, I am, asking that
from the roster maintained by the Civil Service
Commission a Security Hearing Board be desig-
nated to take testimony.
Such action as I have requested is taken on the
assumption that Mr. Davies will voluntarily accept
the jurisdiction of the Security Hearing Board.
Mr. Davies continues his assignment as Coun-
selor of Embassy at Lima, Peru.
