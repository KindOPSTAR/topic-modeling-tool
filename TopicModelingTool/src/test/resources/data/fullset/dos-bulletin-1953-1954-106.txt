that U.S. militar forces in the Far East will
now feature “higily mobile naval, air and am-
phibious units”; and he said in this way, despite
some withdrawal of land forces, the United States
will have a ca acitv to oppose aggression “with
even greater eii’ect than heretofore.”
The bringing home of some of our land forces
also provides a most eloquent rebuttal to the Com-
munist charge of “imperialism.”
NATO
If we turn to Europe, we see readjustments in
the NATO collective securit eﬁort. Senator Van-
denberg called the North tlantic Treaty pledges
“the most practical deterrent and discouragement
to war which the wit of man has yet devised.”
But he said also that “if the concept and objective
are to build suﬂicient forces in being to hold the
Russian line . . . it presents ruinous corollaries
both at home and abroad.”
In the ﬁrst years of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization. after the aggression in Korea, its
members made an emergency buildup of military
strength. I do not question the judgment of that
time. The strength thus built has served well
the cause of peace. But the pace originally set
could not be maintained indeﬁnitely.
At the April meeting of the NATO Council, the
United States put forward a new concept, now
known as that of the “lon haul.” ‘ That meant
a steady development of efensive strength at a
rate which will preserve and not exhaust the eco-
nomic strength of our allies and ourselves. This
would be reinforced by the striking power of a
strategic air force based on internationally agreed
positions.
We found, at the Council of last December, that
there was general acceptance of the “long haul”
concept and recognition that it better served the
probable needs than an effort to create full de-
fensive land strength at a ruinous price.‘
European Detenee Communlty
One of the emergency aspects of NATO is that
it was begun before there was a solid foundation.
For example, lVestern Europe cannot be suc-
cessfully defended without a defense of West
Germany. West Germany cannot be defended
without help from the Germans. German par-
ticipation is excluded by the armistice arrange-
ments still in force.
The West German Republic needs to be freed
from the armistice; and new political arrange-

ments should be made to assure that rearmed Ger-
mans will serve the common cause and never serve
German militarism.
The French produced a plan to take care of
this matter. It was to create a European De-
fense Community, composed of France, Italy Bel-
ium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and West
rmany. They would have a European army,
including Germans, but there would be no na-
tional armies in West Europe.
A treaty to create this defense communit was
sigpled in May 1952. But when the Eisen ower
a inistration took ofﬁce last January, no gov-
ernment had sought parliamentar ratiﬁcation,
and the project was nigh unto deatli.
President Eisenhower is deeply convinced that
there can be no long-term assurance of security
and vitality for Europe, and therefore for the
Western Vi orld includm the United States, un-
less there is a unity which will include France
and Germany and end the disunity which has led
to recurrent wars, and in our generation to two
world wars. As Nero's Chief Commander, and
now as President, he continues to make clear the
importance which the United States attaches to
the consummation of the European Defense Com-
munity and, we would hope thereafter, a political
community.
Until the goals of Eve are achieved, NATO, and
indeed future peace, are in jeopardy. Distrust
between France and Germany is inﬂammable, and
already Communist a nts are looking to it as a
means for internationa arson.
There are of course immense diﬂiculties in the
way of the ﬁnal consummation of Franco-German
unity. But we have conﬁdence that eace will
soon have the indispensable foun ation of
the Euc.
New collective security concepts reduce non-
productive military expenses of our allies to a
point where it is desirable and practicable also to
reduce economic aid. There was need of a more
self-respecting relationship, and that, indeed, is
what our allies wanted. Trade, broader markets,
and a ﬂow of investments are far more healthy
than intergovernmental grants-in-aid.
There are still some strategic spots where the
local governments cannot maintain adequate
armed forces without some ﬁnancial support from
us. In these cases, we take the judgment of our
military advisers as to how to proceed in the com-
mon interest. For example, we have contributed
largely, ungrudgingly, and I hope constructively,
to end aggression and advance freedom in Indo-
china.
The technical assistance program is being con-
tinued, and we stand ready to meet nonrecurrent
needs due to crop failures or like disasters.
But, broadly speaking, foreign budgetary aid is
being limited to situations where it clearly con-
tributes to military strength.
