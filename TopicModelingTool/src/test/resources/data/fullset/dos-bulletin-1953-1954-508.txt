Sale of Vessels to Brazll for
Coastwise Shipping Recommended
Statement by Robert F. lVoodward1
. . . The Secretary of State in his letter of
July 1, 1953, to the Speaker of the House set
forth the reasons why the Department believed
that such legislation was necessary. The bill au-
thorizes the sale of not more than 12 CI—MAV—l
type merchant vessels to Brazil for use in the coast-
wise trade to Brazil. The CI—MAV—l type vessel
was designed for coastal operations.
The United States in cooperation with the Gov-
ernment of Brazil established in 1950 a Jomt
Brazil-United States Economic Development
Commission, under congressional authorization
'ven by Public Law 535, the Act for International
Development, to assist Brazil in its development
planning and economic rehabilitation. One of the
projects which this Commission recommended was
the improvement of Brazil’s coastal shipping.
The sale of the vessels covered by this bill would
not only assist in the economic rehabilitation of
Brazilian coastal shipping but would promote our
own national interest. The rehabilitation of
Brazil’s coastal shipping service is vital to Brazil’s
internal economy, and smce Brazil is a traditional
and important South American ally of the United
States, 1ts improved economic stren h should add
to the defense potential of the estern Hemis-
phere.
Moreover, it may be pointed out that President
Vargas of Brazil has personally requested U.S.
cooperation in permitting Brazil to purchase
coastwise vessels from our laid-up ﬂeet of war-
built vessels.
Brazil under the Ships Sales Act of 1946 pur-
chased 12 vessels of the same type speciﬁed in this
bill and has continually indicated an interest
since that time in obtaining more vessels of this
type. In view of their experience with this type
of ship, which has been used principally in
coastal operations, it is the intention of the Bra-
zilian Government to add the vessels covered by
this bill to its coastal ﬂeet.
Coastwise shipping is a vital link in Brazil’s
transportation system because of its extensive
coastline, population concentration on the coast,
the lack of adequate highway and railroad sys-
tems. Brazil’s internal economic progress de-
pends to a large extent upon improving its inade-
quate coastwise shipping ﬂeet, which now contains
many vessels from 40 to 60 years old. An efﬁcient
coastwise transport system should promote trade

among the various regions of Brazil. The objec-
tive of the Joint Commission’s coastal shipping
program has been to provide Brazil with an efﬁ-
cient well-regulated coastal shipping service
which can meet the bulk freight demands of the
expanding Brazilian economy: This ob'ective has
not as yet been achieved. he lack o adequate
trans ort, therefore, results in low roduction,
and t is, in turn, is partially I‘eSPODSl Is for the
lack of transport. T e lo '00.] way to correct this
situation is to assist Brazi in obtaining more cili-
cient means of coastal trans rtation.
The Joint Commission in making its recom-
mendations in its rehabilitation of the Brazilian
coastal ﬂeet made the following comments:
Anyone who glances at a map can see that the Brazilian
economy is still largely made up of isolated areas scat-
tered along the coast. Some, it is true, penetrate to a
considerable depth but in general the situation is this
and it is clear that the cheapest and best means of (lis
tribution should be by water. Indeed, in many instances
distribution still has to be by water. Apart from the air
transport companies, shipping has no real competition
between North and South, and there are only weak rail
and road connections between the Central, Southern and
North Eastern regions.
Coastal shipping is, at present, the only trul
efﬁcient national transportation system in Brazi ,
linking the southern, central, and northern
regions, and in many cases is the only existing
connection between the various re 'ons.
Brazil has remained more ependent upon
coastal shipping in interstate commerce than most
nations of contlnental dimensions. This is borne
out by the fact that coastal shipping carried 45
ercent of the total interstate commerce tonnage
etween 18 major political units (17 states and fed-
eral districts) winch possess in Brazil ocean ports.
According to the Joint Brazil-United States
Economic Development Commission report, eight
states, six northern and two southern, with a pop-
ulation of over 20 million, depend upon coastal
shipping to carry between 74 and 99 percent of
their total interstate commerce. These are the
states in which coastal shipping has an absolute
advantage, due either to the com lete lack of com-
petitive means of transport or tiie poor condition
of that which does exist.
The states in the North (Para, Amazonas,
Maranhao, Ceara, Bahia, and Rio Grande de
Norte) are most dependent upon coastal shipping,
followed by the southern states of Santa Catarina
and Rio Grande do Sul.
As to the composition b commodity of Brazil’s
coastal shipping trafﬁc, t e Joint Brazil-United
States Economic Development Commission re-
ported that the basic role of coastal shipping in the
transportation system of Brazil is a carrier of bulk
raw materials and foodstuffs. Approximately
55 percent of the total tonnage carried by coastal
ships consists of primary raw materials, 35 per-
cent of foodstuﬁ's, and the remaining 10 percent of
manufactured items.
