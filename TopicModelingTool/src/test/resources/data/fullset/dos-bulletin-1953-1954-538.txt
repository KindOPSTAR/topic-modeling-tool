Quota on Rye Imports
White House press release dated March 31
The President today issued a proclamation
)uttin into effect the recommendations of the
.S. ariﬁ Commission with respect to the im-
portation of rye, rye ﬂour, and rye meal.2
The proclamation provides for an import quota
‘ For a joint statement by the Department of State and
the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Relations regarding the
signing of the agreement together with a summary oi! the
agreement‘s principal points, see Bum.an 0! Mar. 29,
1954, p. 467.
’ Copies of the Tariff Commission's report on rye may
be obtained by addressing requests to the U.S. Tariff
Commission, 8th and E Sts. NW., Washington 25, D. 0.
of 31 million pounds of rye, rve ﬂour, and rye
meal, from all sources, from the date of the procla-
mation until June 30, 1954, and for a quota of
186 million pounds of rye, rye ﬂour and rye meal,
from all sources, during the period July 1, 1954,
to June 30, 1955.
The proclamation, issued under section 22 of
the Agricultural Adjustment Act, was found nec-
essary in order to prevent imports from materially
interfering with the domestic price-support pro-
gram for rye. Rye imports thus far in the cur-
rent crop year have increased sharply in
comparison with the previous year. At the same
time, a record percentage of the 1953 crop has
been placed under price-support loans and burden-
some stocks are in rospect.
In one respect, t e quota period, the President
modiﬁed the recommendation of the Tariff Com-
mission. Instead of a continuing restriction on
r e imports, as the Commission sug ested, the
resident provided for the termination of the
uota on June 30, 1955. A new investigation by
t e Commission and a fresh consideration of the
facts by the President would, therefore, be re-
quired if there appeared to be a need for restric-
tive measures a must im orts of rye beyond the
terminal date 0 this proc amation.
TEXT OF PROCLAMATION 3048'
Was-mus, pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural
Adjustment Act, as added by section 31 of the act of
August 24, 1935, 49 Stat. 773, reenacted by section 1 of
the act of June 3, 1937, 50 Stat. 246. and as amended by
section 3 of the act of July 3. 1948, 62 Stat. 1248, section 3
of the act of June 28, 1950, 84 Stat. 261, and section 8 (b)
of the act of June 16, 1951, 65 Stat. 72 (7 U. S. C. 624),
the Secretary of Agriculture advised me there was reason
to believe that rye, rye ﬂour, and rye meal are being or
are practically certain to be imported into the United
States under such conditions and in such quantities as to
render or tend to render lneﬂective, or materially inter-
fere with, the price~snpport program undertaken by the
Department of Agriculture with respect to rye pursuant
to sections 301 and 401 of the Agricultural Act of 1949,
as amended, or to reduce substantially the amount of
products processed in the United States from domestic
rye with respect to which such program of the Depart-
ment of Agriculture is being undertaken;
ans, on December 9, 1953, I caused the United
States Tariff Commission to make an investigation under
the said section 22 with respect to this matter; ‘
Wamms the said Tarii! Commission has made such
investigation and has reported to me its ﬁndings and rec-
ommendatlons made in connection therewith;
Wnnms, on the basis of the said investigation and
report of the Tarit! Commission, I ﬁnd that rye. rye ﬂour,
and rye meal, in the aggregate, are being and are prae
ticaily certain to continue to be imported into the United
States under such conditions and in such quantities as to
interfere materially with and to tend to render ineffective
the said price-support program with respect to rye. and
to reduce substantially the amount of products processed
in the United States from domestic rye with respect to
which said pricesupport program is being undertaken;
and
\Vni-zams I ﬁnd and declare that the imposition of the
' 19 Fed. Reg. 1807.
