world news by teletype or radio at any moment.
But at least 28 nations do not have teletype news
services of an kind or have them on such a re-
stricted basis t at news cannot even move between
the main population centers. Fifty-four nations
and territories do not even receive the services
of a world news gathering1 agency. Millions of
people see a newspaper or ear a radio broadcast
only at the rarest of intervals. This is a fertile
ﬁeld for realistically conceived and administered
technical assistance.
Both the Secretary-General and the ra porteur
stress the signiﬁcant possibilities of app ying the
concept of technical assistance to free om of in-
formation. They stress the development of inde-
pendent domestic information enterprises, and the
training and exchange of personnel in the infor-
mation media.
Some parts of such a program would be directly
related to economic development, and accordingly
would qualify with the Expanded Program of
Technical Assistance. Other parts would be in-
cluded in the regular programs of the United
Nations and the s ecialized agencies.
The Secretary-general points out in his report
on Independent Information Enterprises that the
United Nations and the specialized agencies have
already extended assistance relating to telecom-
munications, visual media, the manufacture of
paper pulp, paper and newsprint, modernization
of printing tec ni ues, and training of printers.
This demonstrates t at the United Nations already
has the capability and experience to deal with the
technical problems involved.
The most promising new suggestion is that this
technical assistance now be extended to include
the development of independent domestic infor-
mation enter rises. The most important word in
this idea is ‘ inde endent.” We will not accom-
plish our goals if nited Nations technical assist-
ance were to result in politically or governmentally
controlled and guided enterprises. Here again,
the work must be done from the grassroots up—
the real problem is to promote the develo ment of
local newspapers and radio stations whic are ca-
pable of standing on their own feet and are
independent of governmental controls.
We should also keep our eyes clearly on the
most important task—that of getting information
to the people at the local level. This means more
local media. It is premature for us to extend our
limited resources to include the development of
news agencies, desirable as that may be. When
there are enough newspapers or radio stations in
any particular country or area, they themselves
wi 1 create the demand for news agency services.
The Secretary-General wisely recognizes this fact
by pointing out:
information media ﬁeld (i. e., by subsidies or other methods
of ﬁnancing from governmental or other sources) may
tend to discredit the agency's services in the eyes of a
number of its potential clients. Hence, it may be said that
attempts to create a news agency can be encouraged only
if there already exist within the country sumcient poten-
tial clients willing to subscribe to its services.
Another aspect of technical assistance which
could be quite productive is the fellowship pro-
am. The Secreta -General has suggested an
increase of fellowships to enable the staff of
domestic information enterprises of under-
developed countries to serve as trainees in countries
with more highly developed information enter-
prises. The rapporteur has put forward virtually
the same ro osal. This seems a most useful pro-
gram. T e Plnited States has been encouraging
this type of exchange for some time—in fact, 351
leaders of foreign information media visited the
United States as guests of the United States Gov-
ernment during 1952.
Certain other suggestions have been put forward
for action by the specialized agencies or for meas-
ures which can be taken directly b governments
to assist in overcoming technical garriers to the
ﬂow of knowledge and information. Many of
these deserve the su port of this Council, but I
shall leave our detailed views on these questions
for elaboration in the Social Committee.
Professlonal Standards and ﬁghts and Rosponslblll-

Mr. President, there are also possibilities for
making rogress in the area of professional stand-
ards and) of the rights and responsibilities of in-
formation media. However, we must be particu-
larly careful to avoid the use of standards and
responsibilities as a mask to curb the free ﬂow of
information. At its last session, the General As-
sembl adopted a resolution requesting the Secre-
tary- eneral to continue his consultations with
information media as to whether they would be
repared to meet to discuss a code of ethics.5 The
Bnited States, and many other delegations, stressed
at that time that journalists would respect only a
code drawn up without overnmental interference
by representatives of t e rofession. I believe
ﬁrmly we must continue to a here to that principle.
The rapporteur has suggested the possibility of
enlisting the cooperation of information media in
the cause of promoting friendly relations among
nations, with articular emphasis on disseminat-
ing wider r0 essional knowledge of the work of
the Unite Nations, foreign countries and inter-
national affairs. He has suggested that it might be
accomplished through appropriate courses in
schools of journalism, visits of journalists to
foreign countries and to the United Nations, and
interchange of news personnel. My delegation be-
lieves that this might be added to the survey of
The possibility of setting up an independent news agency
depends entirely on its having a suﬂicient clientele to make
its operations viable. It has been found that attempts to
dispense with the sound ﬁnancial backing provided by a
suﬂicient number of clients belonging to the independent
