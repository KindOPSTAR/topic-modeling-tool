He assured the delegates of the nations to whom
he was addressing himself that any partners of
the United States, acting in good faith with us,
would ﬁnd us not unreasonable or uiigenerous.
Conversations In Progress
Private conversations have ensued. There is an
impression I ﬁnd—probably because these conver-
sations are private—that nothin is going on and
that the proposal is dormant. T is is not the case.
The President’s idea has been formulated into a
concrete lan. The plan has been discussed with
certain riendly governments. Just one month
ago today it was handed to the Soviet Ambassador
in Washington for transmittal to his Government.
This step followed the private conversations which
had begun in January and were continued by
Secretary Dulles when the Foreign Ministers met
in Berlin.
thy did the members of the Soviet delegation
in the audience at the United Nations, caught off
their guard, applaud with all the other delegates
there present? And why after the ﬁrst reactions
of denegation and disdain did the Soviet Govern-
ment at last respond? The answer to that must
have been because of the impact of what followed.
For the President had said:
The United States would seek more than the mere
reduction or elimination of atomic materials for military
purposes. It is not enough to take this weapon out of
the hands of the soldiers. It must be put into the hands
of those who will know how to strip its military casing
and adapt it to the arts of peace. The United States
knows that if the fearful trend of atomic military buildup
can be reversed, this greatest of destructive forces can be
developed into a great boon, for the benefit of all man-
kind. The United States knows that peaceful power from
atomic energy is no dream of the future. That capability.
already proved. is here—now—today. Who can doubt,
if the entire body of the world’s scientists and engineers
had adequate amounts of tissionabie material with which
to test and develop their ideas, that this capability would.
rapidly be transformed into universal, eﬂ‘icient, and eco-
nomic usage.
At this oint, I am privileged to state that it is
the Presi ent’s intention to arrange through a
national scientiﬁc organization to convene an in-
ternational conference of scientists at a later date
this year. This conference, which it is hoped will
be largely attended and will include the outstand-
ing men in their professions from all over the
world, will be devoted to the exploration of the
beni and peaceful uses of atomic energy. It
will the ﬁrst time that any such body has been
convoked, and its urpose, also in the words of
the President, will e “to hasten the day when the
fear of the atom will begin to disappear from
the minds of people, and the governments of the
East and IVest.”
What Is the President's Proposal?
A few moments ago I mentioned the fact that
the President’s proposal had been formulated into
a lan. It might be useful to state something
a rmative about what the proposal is and is not
to give a frame of reference within which the
pgactical potentials of a World Atomic Bank can
discussed.
The United States proposal is not just another
move in the chess game of world politics nor is
it grimaril a disarmament formula. It does not
61“ anger t e atomic-weapons secrets of any nation
that now has or may possess such secrets.
It does not involve sudden] placing trust where
yesterday trust could not e reposed. Imple-
menting the roposal requires no reliance upon
impossible en orcemcnt provisions nor does it de-
pend on an interpretation of good faith.
It is not a prescription for technical alleviation
of disease that still scourges too many parts of the
world nor will it in a da —or a year—solve the
desperate struggle for dai y bread where that now
exists. It will not, on any precise] measurable
timetable, turn deserts into lush mea ows nor pro-
vide the ener to lift grinding toil from the backs
of those now living in underdeveloped areas.
The accumulative effect of the operation of the
proposed agency will do these things .-
It will accelerate the application of peaceful
uses of the atom everywhere.
It will divert amounts of ﬁssionable material
from atomic bomb arsenals to uses which will
beneﬁt mankind, and these amounts will steadily
increase as long as the peace is maintained.
It will foster the dissemination of information
for peaceful uses to atomic scientists everywhere.
It will stimulate the acquisition of new funda-
mental data and theory on which all progress
de ends.
t will provide an opportunit for nations which
are atomic have-nets, either individually or b
combining with others, to ac uire atomic facili-
ties best suited to their indivi ual needs.
It will increase man’s knowledge of his own bod
and that of the plants and animals that nouris
him and the insects and pests that threaten him
to the end that the healing art will be advanced
and new ways found to increase the world’s food
sup ly. And man’s useful life span will be
pro onged.
It will encourage young and imaginative minds
in many countries to seek useful careers in the new
disciplines of science and engineering to the end
that they may contribute to improving the econ-
omy and living standards of their respective
countries.
And, perhaps most important of all, the suc-
cessful operation of the International Atomic
Energy Agency will contribute mi htily to focus
ing world attention and understan ing on the po-
tential of atomic energy to enrich the lives of all
of us and thus dispel some of today’s doubts and
fears that its only use would be to destro us.
Only in the last few days le ,islation ias been
introduced designed to amend tile Atomic Energy
Act in part to facilitate the President’s plan.
