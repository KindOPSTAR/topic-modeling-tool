the processes of the United Nations and consult
with its allies. But we could not escape ultimate
responsibility for decisions closely touching our
own security and self-defense.
There are some, particularly abroad, who seem
to assume that the attitude of the United States
ﬂows from a desire for a general war with Com-
munist China. That is clearly false. If we had
wanted such a war it could easily have been based
on the presence of Chinese aggressors in Korea.
But last July, in s ite of difﬁculties which at times
seemed insu erab e, we concluded a Korean armi-
stice with ommunist China. How could it be
more surely demonstrated that we have both the
will to m e peace and the competence to make
peace?
Your Government wants eace, and the Ameri-
can peo le want eace. ut should there ever
be 0 en y launche an attack that the American
peop 0 would clearly recognize as a threat to our
own security, then the right of self-preservation
would demand that we—regardless of any other
country—meet the imue squarely.
It is the task of statesmanship to seek peace and
deter war, while at the same time preserving vital
national interests. Under resent conditions that
dual result is not easy to ac ieve, and it cannot be
achieved at all unless your Government is backed
by a people who are willing, if need be, to sacri-
ﬁce to preserve their vital interests.
At the Geneva Conference I said: “Peace is al-
ways easy to achieve—by surrender.” Your Gov-
ernment does not propose to buy eace at that
price. We do not believe that the erican peo-
ple want peace at that rice. So lon as that is
our national will, and so ong as that wﬁl is backed
by a capacity for effective action, our Nation can
face the future with that calm conﬁdence which
is the due of those who, in a troubled world, hold
fast that which is good.

Geneva Declaration on Korea
Press release 824 dated June 15
Following is the teat of the Martian Declara-
tion on K area issued at Geneva on ane 15 .'
Pursuant to the resolution of August 28, 1953,
of the United Nations General Assembly,1 and the
Berlin communique of February 18, 1954,’ we, as
nations who contributed military forces to the
United Nations Command in Korea, have been
participating in the Geneva Conference for the
§urpose of establishing a united and independent
orea by peaceful means.
We have made a number of proposals and sug-
estions in accord with the past eﬂ’orts of the
United Nations to bring about the uniﬁcation,
inde ndence, and freedom of Korea; and Within
the amework of the following two principles
which we believe to be fundamental.
1. The United Nations, under its Charter, is
fully and rightfully empowered to take collective
action to re el aggressron, to restore peace and
security, an to extend its good ofﬁces to seeking
a peaceful settlement in Korea.
2. In order to establish a uniﬁed, inde ndent
and democratic Kore enuinely free e ections
should be held under supervision, for repre-
sentatives in the national assembly, in which re
resentation shall be in direct proportion to t e
indigenous population in Korea.
We have earnestly and atiently searched for
a basis of agreement which would enable us to
proceed with Korean uniﬁcation in accordance
with these fundamental principles.
The Communist delegations have rejected our
every effort to obtain agreement. The principal
issues between us, therefore, are clear. Firstly, we
accept and assert the authority of the United
Nations. The Communists repudiate and reject
the authority and competence of the United Na-
tions in Korea and have labelled the United Na-
tions itself as the tool of aggression. Were we to
accept this position of the Communists, it would
mean the death of the principle of collective se-
curity and of the UN itself. Secondly, we desire
genuinely free elections. The Communists insist
upon procedures which would make genuinely free
elections impossible. It is clear that the Commu-
nists will not accept impartial and effective super-
vision of free elections. Plainly, they have shown
