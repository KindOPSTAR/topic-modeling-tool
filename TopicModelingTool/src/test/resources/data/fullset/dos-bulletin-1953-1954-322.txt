But curiousl enough, the early pros ectpf
self-determination for these important ritish
colonial areas was not well received by a number
of delegates to the recent General Assembly.
To a delegation like mine, which represents a
Nation that has championed the cause of_inde-
pendence all over the world, it seemed regrettable
and surprising that any members of the Umted
Nations, outside the Soviet bloc, would 0 pose the
exercise of self-determination anyw ere, let
alone a trust territory. . _ _
Ap arently their objections, which were in no
way mmunist-ins ired, were based on a fear
that the coming e ections in Togoland would
somehow work to the disadvantage of the two
trust territories in their progress toward self-
government.
My delegation takes a very different view. We
have followed West African aﬁ'airs closely and
are entirely conﬁdent that, within a year or two
at most, the Gold Coast, for example, will become
completely free—as free, in fact, as Australia,
New Zealand and India, or the United States.
But the important point which should satisfy
every free member of the United Nations is that
the comin elections will provide the voters with
freedom 0 choice.
They may vote to join the Gold Coast, or they
may vote to join French Togoland. This means
we will soon see a very practical demonstration
of African self-determination in action, and it
seems to us that it deserves enthusiastic support.
Mr. President, I would like to emphasize two
points which inﬂuence my dele ation on the sub-
ject of orderly progress towar self-government:
First, we consider that the urge for home rule
or self-determination is the most powerful politi-
cal force of our time.
And, second, we believe that the essence of that
urge is not what is chosen but the right to choose.
These are the two great commandments on which
all political progress is based.
They lead us to conclude that the best way to
deﬂate the colonial issue is to make a d start
toward self-determination in West 1 rica, and
we want you to know that we will support to the
hilt every move in that direction.
In conclusion, it is the view of my delegation
that the decision of the United Kingdom to intro-
duce full adult suﬁ'rage in British Togoland and
to provide an opportunity for the inhabitants to
participate in an election which will doubtless in-
dicate their views about the future status of their
territory re resents statesmanship of a high order
and is in ull accord with the principles of the
trusteeship system.
