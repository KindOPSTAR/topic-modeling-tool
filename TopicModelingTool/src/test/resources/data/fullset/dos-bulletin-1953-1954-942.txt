STATEMENTS BY SECRETARY DULLES
Press release 321 dated June 15
At his news conference on June 15, Secretary
Dulles was asked the purpose of the impendi
visit to the United States of Sir Winston Church ' l
and Anthony Eden. Mr. Dulles replied: '
The 11 ose is no more than the general desire
which 511' inston Churchill has constantly had
to keep in close touch with his American friends.
It has been his practice, I think, over a period of
ears, to come almost annually to this country.
In the rocess of coming here, he keeps in contact
with merican ublic opinion and with the
thinking of the ﬁresident and the Secretary of
State in relation to matters which are of common
concern. This is What you might call a normal
visit in this respect. It does not ow out of any
emergency. It has no agenda. t is merely an
informal talk to ther of the kind which Sir
Winston has soug t over a good many years.
Asked whether the timing 0 the invitation and
its acceptance implied that t ere had been some
change in the British position “due to the failure”
of the Geneva Conference, Mr. Dulles replied:
Well, there has been actually a sort of standing
invitation from the President to Sir Winston and
Mr. E'den to come over here whenever it was con-
venient. They are old friends of his, and he enjoys
the prospect of etting together and having in-
formal talks. This, as I sa , has been a sort of
standin invitation. Actual , it could be said
that it as been outstanding or much more than
some weeks. The fact that 1t is actually accepted
now for the weekend of June 25 is artly due to
the fact that it was not convenient or Mr. Eden
to come over here with Sir Winston while the
Geneva Conference was going on. It looks now
as though the Geneva Conference either will be
terminated or recessed or perhaps reduced to a
lower level of negotiation, so that it now seems
a convenient time to have the sort of informal
get-together which has been in our minds for
some time.
Asked whether it would be fair to assume that
the conversations will have some bearing on waited
action, Mr. Dulles replied:
I would think that it would be fair to assume
that we would talk about whatever are the live
tpplcs of the moment and that might be one of
t iem.
Asked whether another topic would be possible
alternatives to Eve, the Secretary said:
I think my answer to the prior question covers
that one also. As I say, there‘is no agenda, and the
meeting and talks will be extremely informal, and
there will not be, as I understand it, any attem t
to arrive at any formal decisions, but probably the
kind of talk which would be expected of men of
affairs if they gathered to ether in the smoking
room after dinner and tal ed about the matte
that are currently in the news. '
Asked whether the French would be brought
into the talks, Mr. Dulles replied:
I do not think that there will be any French
participation in these articular talks. As I say,
this has been a sort 0 personal invitation of the
President’s to personal friends of his. It is not
intended to arrive at any formal decisions which
would involve matters of legitimate concern to
France, and it is not anticipated that the French
will be invited. This is not going to be like the
three-power talks that took place at Bermuda.
There have been occasions, as you know when the
French President of the Council and the French
Foreign Secretary have been over here alone with-
out the presence of the British, and this will be an
occasion when the British will be here without
the presence of the French. There are no impli-
cations to be drawn from that.
Asked whether he ewpected the visit of Mr.
Churchill and Mr. Eden to advance his e arts and
his interests in the ormation of a col ective de-
fense system for outheast Asia, Mr. Dulles
answered.“
The United States has not given up its view
that the situation in that area would be improved
by the creation of a collective defense system. I
would hope that the talks here would at least
further progress along that line. There seems to
be some indication that the British feel that the
possibilities of Geneva have been exhausted and
that the result is sufﬁciently barren so that alter-
natives should now be considered. If that is the
way they feel when they come over here, I hope
that that can lead to a closer meeting of the minds
which may permit, in consultation with the other
states which are legitimately involved, the taking
of some decisions.
