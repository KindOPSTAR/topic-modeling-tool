I know the Arabs are wrong in this interpreta-
tion of the American people. Yet I believe it is
a fact that many of them do have such an inter-
pretation. One can only ask their reporters in
this country to make a further real effort to judge
the temper of the American people. I am con-
ﬁdent that after such a renewed study they would
indicate to their governments that America would
back no state, includin Israel, in a matter of ex-
ansive aggression an that its 0 position would
he equally strong regardless of w ch side started
such a move.
If this fact could be established in the Arab
mind, we would have passed one of our greatest
difﬁculties in dealings with them. When and if
such reports from their own representatives will
begin to have an effect in the Arab world we do
not know. We will know, however, when that
effect has taken place because we will then en-
counter a far greater measure of conﬁdence on
the part of the Arab world.
REFUGEE SITUATION
Another fundamental we should keep in mind is
the fact that a ortion of the people involved in
this dispute are omeless. The reason behind this,
as with nearly ever other facet of the whole com-
lex of Arab-Israe i problems, is itself in dispute.
ore time and effort is spent upon justifying this
or that stand as to who is more nearly to be blamed
than is spent u on how to solve the problem that
now exists. _ at a breath of fresh air would be
given the world if all concerned would simply ad-
mit the fundamental fact that these people are
homeless—are in desperate want—and are uncom-
pensated for their pro erty and other losses that
they have suffered. an anyone beneﬁt by the
continued compression of these people in tiny
areas and in other circumstances that make for
moral degeneration and the making of a new
generation fed on bitterness and hate?
There is a moral obligation in this situation
that rests u on the countries immediately involved
and upon a l of the countries who have a stake in
world peace. A solution of this problem would
do more than anything else to reduce the incidents
of border violence.
For our part, we have seen the most practical
and long-term solution for the majorit of these
people to be the rovision of new lan s for set-
tlement. Materia assistance has been provided
to the United Nations by this country as well as
others to make such developments ossible. The
United States has expressed its willingness to help
provide funds for a development plan of the
Jordan Valley which would allow resettlement of
a sizable portion of the Arab refugees. We have
also indicated our willingness to assist in develop-
ments elsewhere which would provide the oppor-
tunity for employment and the eventual procure-
ment of homes for large numbers of people. The
United States has also stood for the resettlement
of a 1portion of the refugees in the territory of
Israe . It should be borne in mind that the
mostly lived as farmers on terraced land whic
probably only they are likely to make fertile and
productive.
Some small progress is being made, but this
approach alone is probably too slow in the face
0 the present situation. One must look, there-
fore, to additional steps that might have a more
immediate effect. One of these is the question
of compensation. These refugees, after many
long years, are still uncompensated for the loss
of their roperty, both real and personal, which
was left ehind in Israel.
The sense of property is almost as integral a
part of the makeup of modern man as the sense
of a family or nation. So lon as the refugees
have no meaningful assurances t at they will ever
be compensated for their property, it Will be hard
for them to adjust to a new set of conditions or
to bend their efforts toward ﬁndin a new liveli-
hood. They read every day 0 transactions
whereby the “abandoned” pro erty left behind
in Israel is bein transferred, ught, and sold.
They have hear many statements made of the
intentions of Israel, but such statements in vacuo
are not reassuring. The fact that Israel has ob-
tained and is now using restitution from Germany
while doing nothing toward the com ensation of
Arab refugees understandably adds to their
bitterness.
Clearly this is a matter to be attended to. I
do not believe, however, that Israel will refuse
to discuss matters such as this on a realistic basis
with her nei hbors. We believe Arab govern-
ments who refuse on general principle to entertain
any discussions with their Israeli neighbors may
amongother things be depriving themselves and
their Ioslem brothers in the refu ee camps of
advantages that could be theirs. n the other
hand, if the goal to be sought in the ﬁrst instance
is the lessemn of tensions along the borders,
Israel might nd some way of arranging for
step-by-step moves on such speciﬁc problems with-
out giving the suspicion to her neighbors that her
policy is one of “total peace or nothing.”
QUARREL IASICALLY NATIONALI‘TIC
There is another fundamental which we should
have in mind, if only for the sake of our own
understanding of the true nature of the roblem.
It is that the uarrel which divides t e Arab
States and Israe is not basically religious. It is
essential] a nationalistic quarrel such as could
arise with equal bitterness between two other
peoples whose national aspirations clashed.
For many centuries Jews and Arabs lived side
by side in the Middle East in relative harmony.
There is much that is similar in their religions.
