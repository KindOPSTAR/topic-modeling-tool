Au st 1, 1953, by Reorganization Plan Number
8, t e Educational Exchange Programs and In-
ternational Information Programs were ad-
ministered by the International Information Ad-
ministration of the Department of State. The
retention of the Exchange Programs in the De-
artment of State, at the time the Informatlon
Program was transferred to a separate agency,
was in harmony with the views of the Senate’s
s ecial Subcommittee, referred to above. This
ubcommittee recommended that the exchange
program be expanded and retained in the Depart-
ment of State, noting that “the ro ram is non-
political and non ropagandistic in c aracter.” .
The responsibi ities of the Department for this
program are to a eat extent supervlsory, Since
certain operationa functions are performed _1n
the United States by public and private agencies
having special competence in the exchange ﬁelds
concerned, and overseas by bi-national United
States Educational Foundations and Commissions
set up for this purpose.
The Department’s res onsibilities include policy
and administrative gui ance to these agencies, the
negotiation of agreements with foreign countries
for the use of foreign currencies, the coordination
of exchange activities for which it has responsibil-
ity with exchange programs of other Government
and private agencles, authorization for expendi-
ture of funds by United States Foundations and
Commissions overseas, the review of individual
country programs and budgets, and evaluation of
over-all program effectiveness. The Department
also provides staff services for the Board of F or-
eign Scholarships.
The Board of Foreign Scholarships—Pursuant
to the Act, a Board of Foreign Scholarships, ap-
pointed by the President, has the responsibility
for supervising the rogram, selecting candidates,
and determining w ich educational institutions
are qualiﬁed to participate.
The Board, which serves without compensation,
was composed of the followin members as of De-
cember 31, 1953: Mr. Frederick L. Hovde, resi-
dent of Purdue University, who was elected hair-
man of the Board during 1953; Miss Margaret
Clapp, resident of Wellesley College, who was
elected I{Iice Chairman during 1953; Brigadier
General John N. Andrews, personal representative
of the Administrator of Veterans’ Affairs, Vet-
erans Administration; Mr. Samuel M. Brownell,
United States Commissioner of Education; Mr.
Charles S. Johnson, president of Fisk University;
Mr. Walter Johnson, chairman of the Department
of History, University of Chicago; Mr. Martin
R. P. McGuire, professor of Greek and Latin,
Catholic Univers1ty of America; Dr. Francis
Scott Smyth, dean of the Medical School, Uni-
versity of California; Miss Helen C. White, pro-
fessor of English, University of Wisconsin; and
Mr. Philip H. Willkie, lawyer and representative
to the Indiana Legislature. The Executive Sec-
retary is Mr. Francis J. Colligan, Deputy Director
of the International Educational Exchange Serv-
ice of the Department.
The Board held four meetings in 1953, as well
as 16 meetings of its subcommittees on selections,
planning, and stipends. During this period, the
Board selected 4,503 candidates for awards, ap-
proved 27 additional educational institutions
abroad for participation in the program, and re-
viewed and a roved annual country programs
sponsored by nited States Educational F ounda-
tions and Commissions abroad. In selecting
American citizens, the Board, pursuant to the
Act, ave preference to veterans provided all other
quali cations were equal. For example, of the
1,606 American students, teachers, lecturers, and
research scholars receiving awards during 1953,
489 were veterans of either World War I, World
War II, or Korea.
Among the signiﬁcant policy decisions taken
by the Board during 1953 were: (1) approval of
the general framework within which American
studies conferences can be developed overseas; (2)
extension of the program to non-academic persons
and ﬁelds, by approving projects under which
journalists from South East Asian countries and
labor leaders from Japan can receive travel rants;
(3) the development overseas of centers or the
study of linguistic sciences; and (4) recommenda-
tions for improving the State scholar program.
Qooperatmg Agencies—The four agencies in
this country which assist the Department under
contract or working fund agreements are the
American Council on Education, which provides
certain services for teacher exchanges with Ameri-
can elementary and secondary schools abroad; the
Conference Board of Associated Research Coun-
cils, for research scholar and lecturer exchanges;
the Institute of International Education, for can-
didates for study awards; and the United States
Oﬁice of Education, for teacher exchanges with
foreign elementary and secondary schools. These
agencies perform such services as accepting and
reviewing applications for awards, conﬁrming
placement in American educational institutions,
arranging programs and itineraries, counseling
foreign grantees while in this country, and en-
listing monetary support from non-governmental
groups for the purpose of increasing opportuni-
ties for study, research and teaching under the
program.
These agencies are also active in disseminating
information about the program and in enlisting
the voluntary support of local groups to carry
out various program functions. For instance, ap-
proximately 1,000 Fulbright advisors on Ameri-
can college campuses cooperated with the Insti-
tute of International Education in disseminating
information about scholarship opportunities to
American students. These advisors also assisted
local preliminary selection committees in screen-
