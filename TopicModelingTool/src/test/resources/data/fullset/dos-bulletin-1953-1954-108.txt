Press release 12 dated January 12
Following are the Mrfa of a note dated Jan-
uary 5 from the Austrian Government and the
reply of the US. Gar‘ernmcnt dalcd January 12
regarding [he mulual desire of the two Govern-
monhr for the early conclusion of an Austrian state
treaty:
Austrian Note at January 5
The Federal Government has learned with great
satisfaction from the exchange of notes between
the Governments of the United States of America,
the Republic of France, the United Kingdom and
the U.S.S.R. that the conference of the four For-
eign Ministers of the above-mentioned states will
start in Berlin on January 25, 1954.
Within the spirit of its own repeatedly issued
statements as well as of the unanimous resolu-
tions of the Austrian Parliament, the Austrian
Federal Government again addresses the urgent
appeal to the Government of the United States
of America on this occasion to concede to the treat-
ment of the Austrian question such a place within
the framework of the forthcoming conference as
would facilitate a ﬁnal and satisfactory settlement
and the earliest possible determination of the state
of affairs which has burdened and oppressed this
country for so many years.
The Federal Government expresses the ﬁrm ex-
pectation that the hopes of the Austrian nation
will not be frustrated again.
0.8. Note of January 1.2
With reference to the Austrian Government’s
note of January 5, the Government of the United
States has shared for many years the deep desire
of the Austrian nation for an early conclusmn of a
State Treaty. To this end the Government of the
United States on July 15, 1953, in proposing a
meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the United
Kingdom, France, the USSR. and the United
States, declared that an Austrian Treaty clearly
constitutes an essential element of European settle- '
ment which the United States Government regards
as a major contribution to peace, and that agree-
ment on such a treaty should be reached ﬁnally
whenever the four Foreign Ministers might meet.1
Again in its notes to the Government of the
U.S.S.R. on September ‘2, October 18, November
16, November 25, and December 8,2 the Govern-
ment of the United States expressed the earnest
belief that an Austrian Treaty should be concluded
at the earliest meeting of the Foreign Ministers.
The Government of Austria may be assured that
there has been no change in the intention of the
Government of the United States to seek and take
every opportunit of restoring to Austria its well
deserved politica and economic independence by
agreement among the occupying powers on the
terms of an Austrian Treaty. T e meeting of the
Foreign Ministers at Berlin will be such an oppor-
tunity and the Government of Austria may be con-
ﬁdent that its as irations will there be given every
support by the overnment of the United States.
U.S. Export Policy
Toward Soviet Bloc
Secretary of Commerce Sinclair Weeks reported
on January 13 that US. export policy toward the
Soviet bloc continues unchanged. Under this
policy, the US. Government is approvin the ex-
ort of nonstrategic goods to the U.S.S. . and its
uro ean satellites. except for transactions which
won] adversely affect the security interests of
the free world. But US. exports to Communist
China and North Korea continue under a complete
embargo.
This statement on export control policy is con-
tained in the Commerce Secretary‘s 25th Quarterly
Report to the President and the Congress on oper-
ations under the Export Control Act.
Secretary \Veeks said:
From the outset. our security export controls have been
selective—being concentrated on those goods specially
identiﬁed as of strategic value to the Soviet bloc. Despite
the absence of substantive export restrictions on goods
of little or no strategic value, however, our exports of
