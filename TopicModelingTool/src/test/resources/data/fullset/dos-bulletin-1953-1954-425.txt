army. Her military tradition and ability are
proved. She occupies an important location cov-
ering the invasion routes into the Indian subconti-
nent and also one which would enable her, under
conditions of strength, to support the defense of
the Near East roper.
To realize er potential, however, Pakistan
needs outside assistance. She does not have the
raw materials or the productive capacity to arm
herself sufﬁciently to withstand outside aggres-

On the opposite side, the Government of the
United States had to consider and did consider
the attitude of Pakistan’s great neighbor, India.

Since the artition of the subcontinent between
India and akistan in 1947, relations between
the two countries have been strained. The violence
which accompanied the separation and which was
followed by the clash over the State of Kashmir
resulted in differences which have been exceed-
ingly difﬁcult to resolve. We feared, and subse-
guent evidence has borne out our fears, that many
ndians would dislike the prospect of military
assistance to a neighboring count with whom
they were not on the best of terms. llyiidian spokes-
men have expressed anxiety that military assist-
ance would make Pakistan more aggressive and
would make the Pakistani Govermnent feel that
it could wield a big stick with respect to Kashmir.
In addition, the problem was further com li-
cated by the Indian Government’s concept of n-
dia’s role in world affairs. It has been described
variously as the idea of a “no war area” or “neu-
tral group” or as the center of a “neutral bloc.”
In the arguments against United States aid to
Pakistan which have been advanced in India dur-
ing the past few months, we ﬁnd that one of the
central themes is the fear that such a move would
destroy the “neutrality” of the subcontinent and
bring the cold war to India’s borders.
In discussing United States military assistance
in the Indian Council of States on December 24,
1953, Prime Minister Nehru said:
We have declared that we should be parties to no
war. . . . We had hoped that other countries, more espe-
cially the countries of Asia which were situated more or
less like us, would also follow that policy because it
was to their advantage as well as to the larger advantage
of Asia. . . . We, in our own way, worked for and
looked forward to this area, if I may say so, as the
“no-war area" in Asia. Naturally we hoped that Pak-
istan which was in a sense, similarly circunistanced as
we are, would belong to that area also. Now, if any
military aid comes to Pakistan from the United States
it is obvious that Pakistan drops out of that area. What-
ever else may happen, Pakistan lines up with a major
group of powers. . . . That is a serious thing. It means
that the cold war, as it is called, comes to Pakistan
and, therefore, comes to India’s borders on the West and
the East, on both sides. It means that if a hot shooting
radii developed it also comes right up to the borders of
ii a.
Mr. Nehru has also expressed the fear that mili-
tary aid to an Asian country might be the open-
ing wedge for the reintroduction of Western
im erialism.
Ve must and do respect Mr. Nehru’s opinions.
He is the great leader of a great nation of 376
million people. He has been unswerving in his
support for democracy and in his ﬁght against
Communists in his own country. There are strong
traditions of friendship between the United States
and India which must not be broken and which I
am positive will be strengthened. But we feel
entitled to differ with Mr. Nehru on policy mat-
ters involving our relations with other countries
just as he is entitled to differ with us.
What has hap ned in Eastern Euro e—Po-
land, Czechoslova ia, the Baltic States, t e East
Zone of Germany—what happened in Korea and
Indochina, all point unmistakably to the glaring
fact that the free peoples of the world are ealing
with a conspirac that has as its objective the
enslavement of al of us. Our message is a simple
one: If freedom is to survive it must be protected.
Our techni us for doing this—and it is a proven
one—lies Within the concept of collective security.
We cannot allow peoples who want to live in peace
and security to be picked off one by one. Our in-
dividual stren hs are not suﬁicient to hold off the
full power 0 the Soviets. Together, they are.
We have proved in Korea that this idea is a valid
one.
Strength a Deterrent to Attack
We do not, therefore, believe that the strength-
enin of freedom-loving nations invites attack.
On t e contrary, we think ex erience has shown
that it is a deterrent to attac . We believe that
in a matter of such eat im ortance to both of
them, Pakistan and t e Uni States must follow
their own convictions while at the same time fully
respecting the convictions of others who honestly
disa eed.
e do not, of course, agree that American aid
to any country is a form of imperialism. In the
light of India’s history and the national feelings
of her people we can understand why she is super-
sensitive on this score, but we think a careful study
of the history of American aid programs in other
countries would show that her fears are un-
founded. Nations such as Turkey, Greece, France,
Great Britain, and many others have not sur-
rendered their independence in receiving United
States aid.
thile the executive branch of your Government
had the questions of military aid to Pakistan
under consideration, we kept the Government of
India informed of what would be involved. \Ve
assured it that no quid pro guo such as military
bases was involved. I cannot say that we were suc-
cessful in changing the attitudes of the Indian
Government toward this proposal. \Ve were in-
