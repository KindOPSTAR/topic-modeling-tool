tries. It also showed that the high level of our
srosperity, particularly with regard to the farmer,
epends to a great extent u on the amount of
goods other countries are ab e to buy from us,
and it brought out the vital importance of two-
way international trade to our own continued
economic prosperity.8
Recent statistics strikingly re-em hasize these
same hard facts. United States tota agricultural
exports for the 1952—53 crop ear amounted to
$2.8 billion. Signiﬁcant thong this ﬁgure is in
showin the magnitude of American farm income
derive from abroad, it is, nevertheless, 30 ercent
below the agricultural export ﬁgure for t e pre~
ceding 12 months of 1951—52, and 20 percent
below the 5-year average for the crop years
1947—52. The volume of exports of wheat
and wheat ﬂour in crop year 1953 dropped b 33
(percent under the previous 12-month period; ard
ropped by 33 percent; and cotton and cotton
linters, by 50 percent. Though farm exports evi-
denced an upward trend durin the latter half of
1953, they were still substantia y under the 1947-
52 average.
American industry, too, leans heavily on its
foreign markets. As of the third quarter of 1953,
our nonagricultural exports, excluding military
aid shipments, were running at the rate of about
$9 billion for the year. On the same basis, these
are some of the items American industry exported
for the full year 1953; over 250,000 automobiles
and trucks; almost 500,000 refrigerators and
freezers; almost 12 million barrels of lubricating
oil- and more than $1 billion worth of machine
tools, agricultural machinery, and tractors.
Our farms and factories could ill afford to lose
these enormous sales abroad, but the extent to
which the foreign market for American goods
contracts or enlarges depends in great measure
upon the amount of dollars other countries have
available to spend. With economic aid tapering
off, a constantly expanding volume of interna-
tional trade, cou led with increased outﬂow of
private United tates investment capital, is the
only real, lon -term solution to dollar shortages
abroad. In t is connection, it should be noted
that much of the improvement in Western Eu-
rope’s gold and dollar reserves has been due to the
extraordinary United States military expendi-
tures in Europe and to the fact that the Euro ean
countries as a whole have been buying less mm
the hard-currency areas. Other countries of the
world, also, have in general been trying to con-
serve their dollar exchange. As a result, the
overall volume of international trade has remained
rather constant. This is not the sort of stability
we are seeking. Stable economies should not
mean static economies. This could lead only to
eventual economic stagnation. Rather we look to
increase the ﬂow of mutually proﬁtable world-
wide trade.
' BULLETIN of Sept. 21, 1953, p. 384.
It is an exceedingly diﬂicult and complex task
to develop a national trade policy consistent with
America’s position as the world’s greatest creditor
and greatest producer, and, at the same time, not
place inequitable burdens either upon speciﬁc
segments of the American economy or upon other
nations who must earn their living in the world.
Yet, unquestionabl , if the nations of the world
are to ﬂourish an move on to higher levels of
trade, production, and living standards, the for-
mulation and activation of such a policy is of
utmost importance.
In this connection, the recommendations re-
cently made by the President’s bipartisan Com-
mission on Foreign Economic Policy, headed by
Clarence B. Randall,‘ are being carefully con-
sidered.
THE NEED FOR PRIVATE INVESTMENT AIROAD
Alon with other measures, international invest-
ment p ays an essential part in achieving a larger
volume of world trade and production. Private
investment abroad brings two-way beneﬁts. It
enables the recipient country to make more rapid
strides toward development of its own resources,
toward greater productivity of its agriculture and
industries, and toward better living standards for
its ople. For the investor, in addition to im-
mediate monetary returns in the form of earnings
and reinvestment ca ital, it brin new markets
and a wider deman for his pro ucts; in many
cases, it provides additional sources of needed
supplies. During the 6-month period, discussmns
were carried on With various governments on ways
to utilize United States private investment capital
to the greater mutual advanta _e of the investor
and the country involved. ese discussions
roved particularl fruitful with reference to
urkey. The Tur 'sh Government has passed
legislation to remove many of the obstacles which
heretofore have retarded the use of private de-
velopment capital.
RAISING WORLD LIVING STANDARDS
In any consideration of the various ways by
which the United States can assist other countries
in their efforts to make better use of their resources
and speed their development, we must keep sight
of the fact that our prima concern is not With
production statistics and in ex numbers, but with
people. The ultimate aim of our technical and
economic pro ams is to advance the well-being
and improve t e standard of living of the individ-
ual farmer and the individual worker.
Western Europe has the world’s largest reser-
voir of skilled man wer and is second only to the
United States in industrial capacity. Yet per
capita oss national product for Western Europe
