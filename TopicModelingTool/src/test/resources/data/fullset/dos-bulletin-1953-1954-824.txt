have made possible the drilling of hundreds of
deep wells whose waters have raised the produc-
tivity of parched acres. India has used eﬂectlvely
the aid we have given and can usefully absorb the
aid provided for in the 1955 program.
In India democracy faces its most important
trial—unless it succeeds there we cannot expect
democracy to command the respect of other Asian
peoples. Further economic assistance to India 15
clearly in our national interest. We are not trying
to put out a ﬁre in India. But we are taking con-
structive ﬁre preventive measures. We are not
waiting until the country is in immediate peril
before taking an interest in it.
Our desire to encourage the owth of economic
and political freedom in India is an important
reason for continuing our aid but there are other
compelling reasons. Our economic aid to India
provides solid testimony to the nations of Asia
that this country is aware of the need to remove
the conditions which encourage the growth of
communism in addition to simply being willing
to strengthen armed resistance to communism
whenever it threatens aggression.
Dlstrust of Western Motlva
Unfortunately, as part of the aftermath of
western colonialism in Asia, the Asian peoples are
still distrustful of the methods and motives of
ourselves and our allies. The Communists play
skillfully on the suspicion that any move we make
to strengthen the forces of freedom through mili-
tary means is in reality aimed at establishing a
new, American imperialism in Asia. Our eco-
nomic and technical assistance pro ams in India
provide tangible proof that our p0 icy is not one
of exploitation but rather one of enlightened self-
interest striking at poverty and ignorance, which
are the basic causes of aggression and chaos, and
that we have not decided that there are only mili-
till? solutions to Asian problems.
am not ashamed to say that I think aid to
India should be given in part on purely humani-
tarian grounds. Within the limits of our own
national economic health, it is good for the world
and for our own souls to aSS1st in raising the
economic level of nations poorer than we are. We
need not be afraid of being called do-gooders
when we are acting in keeping with our own
highest national traditions.
A recent source of friction between India and
the United States was our recent decision, in re-
sponse to Pakistan’s request, to give military as-
sistance to Pakistan.8 This decision was taken
to help Pakistan become a stronger member of
the community of free nations who are determined
to resist Communist aggression. Between India
and Pakistan there are still a number of important
unsolved disputes and our decision to aid Pakistan
militaril was greeted with a great deal of un-
easiness in India since it was feared this aid might
be used against India. President Eisenhower, in
his announcement and in his letter on the sub ect
to Prime Minister Nehru, made it absolutely ciear
that the arms we would give could in no way be
used in aggression without his taking appropriate
action in accordance with his constitutlonal au-
thority. Our decision to help Pakistan with mili-
tary equipment heightens the need for strengthen-
in our ties with India.
owever, India has proved its willingness to
lend a hand in settling vexing international dis—
putes. In Korea, India assumed the difﬁcult task
of acting as custodian for those prisoners of war
from each side who did not wish to return to their
homelands. President Eisenhower sent his r-
sonal congratulations to Prime Minister Ne ru
on the ﬁne job done by the Indian forces in Korea.‘
I believe too that in this country there are some
common misconceptions about the attitude of In-
dia and its leaders toward communism. The Com-
munists are an active political party in India
today but they have not been so successful there
as they have been in some other foreign countries.
The part remains a determined minority group,
eager an clever at capitalizin on any failures or
shortcomings of the present democratic govern-
ment of Prime Minister Nehru. However, Mr.
Nehru and the Congress Party which he heads
are strongly anti-Communist. They have not hes-
itated to suppress vigorously Communist violence.
They ﬁnd frequent opportunity to point out to
the Indian peo le that communism is a foreign
ideology contro led and manipulated by foreigners
in a foreign land—Russia.
Last year Congress enacted a substantial aid
program for Indla. I do not believe that any
events of the past year have altered materially the
factors which led us to decide to give this aid. An
independent India is still an im ortant source of
strength to the free world. I ope deeply that
the work we have started in India can 0 on and
that the Congress will enact the Presi ent’s pro-
posals for continuing to help India with technical
assistance and a certain amount of basic economic
ai . . . .
