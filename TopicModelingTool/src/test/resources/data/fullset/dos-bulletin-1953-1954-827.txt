the north and west, it is but natural that Ethiopia
should be the ﬁlter through which the ideas and
inﬂuences of the continent of Africa should pass
to the East and vice versa.
Thus, our social and political outlook and
orientation became important not only in terms
of Middle Eastern and African but also, in terms
of world politics—and this leads me to point to
a factor which I consider to be of unique sig-
niﬁcance. We have a profound orientation
toward the West. One consideration alone,
although there are others, would sufﬁce to explain
this result. The two Americas and the continent
of Europe together constitute exactly one-third
of the land masses of the world. It is in this one-
third that are concentrated the peoples of the
Christian faith. With but rare exceptions
Christianity does not extend beyond the conﬁnes
of the Mediterranean. Here, I ﬁnd it signiﬁcant
that, in point of fact, in this remaining two-thirds
of the earth’s surface, Ethiopia is the state having
the largest Christian population'and is b far the
largest Christian state in the Middle ast. In
fact, Ethio ia is unique among the nations of the
world in t at it is, today, the one remaining
Christian state that can trace her history unbroken
as a Christian polity from the days when the
Roman Empire itself was still a vi orous reality.
The strength of the Christian tra ition has been
of vital signiﬁcance in our national history, and
as a force for the uniﬁcation of the Empire of
Ethio ia. It is this force which ives us, amon
the ot er countries of the Middle ast, a profound
orientation toward the West. We read the same
Bible. We speak a common spiritual language.
It is this heritage of ideals and princi les that
has excluded from our conscious, indeed, rom our
unconscious processes, the possibility of com-
promisin with those principles which we hold
sacred. ' e have sou ht to remain faithful to the
principle of respect or the rights of others, and
the right of each people to an independent
existence. We, like you, are profoundly opposed
to the un-Christian use of force and are, as you
attached to a concept of the aciﬁc settlement 0
disputes. Our lone strug le fore the outbreak
of the last world catastrop e as, indeed, our recent
participation in the combined efforts and the
glorious comradeship in arms in Korea have
marked us, like you, in giving more than lipservice
to these ideals. It is your deep comprehension of
our ideals and struggles in which it has been my
privilege to lead, at times not without heartbreak,
my beloved people, and our common comradeship
in arms that have laid a very sure and lasting
basis for friendship between a great and a small
country.
U.S.-Ethiopian Commerclel Reletlons
Last year, we concluded with you a new treaty
of friendship, commerce, and navigation de-
signed to assure to American business enter rise
expanded opportunities in Ethiopia. Our do lar-
based currency is also there to assure the ready re-
turn to the United States of the roﬁts of their
investments. \Ve have entrus to American
enterprise the development of our civil aviation
which has surpassed all expectations. To Ameri-
can enterprise we have conﬁded the ex loitation
of our oil resources as well as of our gol de osits.
Although my country is 8,000 miles remover from
the eastern seaboard of the United States, United
States exports to Ethiopia have, notwithstand-
ing this heavy handicap, pushed forward to the
forefront in Ethiopia.
Conversely, the United States stands in ﬁrst
rank of countries to whom we ex ort. Ethiopia
which has, from the Province of aﬁa, given the
world the name and product of coffee, produces on
her high plateau one of the ﬁnest mocha coffees
in the world. The coffee which you drink at-
tains its unique and pleasant American ﬂavor
in part, at least, through the added mixture of
Ethiopian coﬁ'ee. American shoes are made, in
part at least, from Ethiopian oatskins which are
principally exported to the nited States.
On the other hand, you have given us valuable
support, not onl in lend-lease assistance durin
the war, and to ay through mutual-security and
technical-assistance a reements, but you have also
powerfully aided us 1n obtainin rectiﬁcation of
on -standing injustices. If, to ay, the brothers
of thiopia stand ﬁnally united under the Crown
and if Ethio ia has regained her shoreline on the
Red Sea, it as been due, in no small measure to
the contribution of the United States of America.
I am happy to take this occasion to express to you,
the Congress, which has approved thls assistance,
the sincere and lasting appreciation of my people.
Defense of Collective Securlty
This collaboration with the West and with the
United States in particular has taken yet broader
forms. There is our military collaboration based
on the mutual-security program. If we leave
aside Greece and Turkey as belonging to the
North Atlantic group, Ethiopia has been the only
state of the Middle East to follow the example of
the United States in sending forces to Korea for
the defense of collective security.
In so doing, Ethiopia has been inspired by a
vision which is broader than her preoccupation
with regional policies or advantages. Nearly
two decades ago, I personally assumed before his-
tory the responsibility of placing the fate of my
beloved people on the issue of collective security,
for surely, at that time and for the ﬁrst time in
world history, that issue was posed in all its clar-
ity. My searchings of conscience convinced me
of the rightness of my course and if, after untold
sufferings and, indeed, unaided resistance at the
