military government in Germany, Japan, Korea,
and Okinawa.
A subcommittee of the House Committee on For-
eign Aﬂ'airs, followmg an inspection of the work-
ings of the laws’ voluntary relief provrsrons in
Europe, reported:
. . . American voluntary relief Is an essential counter-
part to foreign relief and recovery programs conducted
by this Government. . . .
The subcommittee was reminded repeatedly in the
course of its inquiry of qualities in private relief such as
are not found in public relief programs.
The organizations engaged in private relief represent
the diversity as well as the unity of American life. They
are based upon the interest in ethnic groups in their kins-
men abroad. They represent in part the interest of Amer-
ican religious groups in their co-religionists in other coun-
tries and in humanity in general. They draw support
from the interest of American labor groups not only in
assisting needy members of labor groups abroad but also
in assisting such groups in supporting humanitarian proj-
ects in their own lands. . . .
Private relief ventures abroad have adapted their re-
sources to the meeting of particular needs in local areas.
In this they have demonstrated an elasticity that is not
found In the over-all programs carried on under public
authority. . . .
. . . it is apparent that voluntary foreign relief, given
adequate public support. will continue to be of signifi-
cant and increasing value as an adjunct to public relief
programs.
. . . The subsidy [for ocean freight] has well justiﬁed
itself, in the subcommittee's view, and the Congress should
give favorable consideration to extending it in relation
to future relief and recovery legislation.‘
The voluntary relief rovisions of Public Laws
84 and 271 of the 80t Congress established a
precedent. Each Congress since then has recog-
nized the complementary value of voluntary aid
to esublic programs of assistance and has author-
iz material sup ort to the voluntary agencies
whenever such 11 lic programs were authorized.
When the Mars all plan was under consideration,
the favorable report of the House Subcommittee
on Voluntary Foreign Aid made possible a pro-
priate re resentations to Congress. Sec. 11 (c)
of the onomic Coo ration Act of 1948, “in
order to further the e cient use of United States
voluntary contributions for relief in participatin
countries receiving assistance in the form 0
grants,” provided for the reimbursement by the
Administrator of ocean freight charges incurred
by registered agencies. Under the Administra-
tor’s regulations, payment was authorized on
voluntary shipments to Austria, Belgium, China,
France, the United Kingdom, Greece, Italy
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and the zones of
Germany and Trieste occupied b the United
States, the United Kingdom, and rance.‘
Moreover, the Secretary of State was authorized
to negotiate agreements with the governments of
the Eca grant countries for the provision of duty-
free entry of relief supplies and the defrayment of
the inland transport costs from counterpart funds.

Pursuant to this authorit agreements were
effected to include the Unite Kingdom, Norway,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, France, Germany,
Austria, Greece, Italy, Trieste, Yugoslavia, Free
China, and Korea.
The authority granted by the ECA Act was car-
ried forward by section 535 of the Mutual Security
Act of 1951, as amended. and was expanded to
include not only the Marshall plan countries but
countries eli ible for economic and technical as-
sistance, such as the Arab States, Israel, India,
Pakistan Korea, and the American Republics.
This authorit has permitted negotiations to be
initiated fort e acceptance of voluntary programs
of relief and rehabilitation under the su rvision
of registered American agencies. xecutive
Order 10368 of June 30, 1952, pursuant to the
Mutual Security Act of 1951 placed authority to
gay ocean freight charges in the De artment of
tate after J une 30, 1952,1° and regu ations were
issued accordingly."
Parallel to these postwar acts of Congress ro—
viding funds and foods, and through the develop-
ing strength of the American Council of Volun-
tary Agencies for Foreign Service, has been the
organization of the Council’s member agencies
into a number of federations. These have been
organized to take the fullest advantage of the su
port and facilities of the Government and of til:
articipating governments with which agreements
liave been effected. Furthermore, these federa-
tions have promoted concerted action in the ﬁeld.
Among them are the Cooperative for American
Remittances Everywhere (Cans) ; Council of Re-
lief Agencies Licensed for Operation in Germany
XCmnoo) ; American Council of Voluntary
gencies in Greece; American Council of Volun-
tary A ncies for Italian Service; Coordinatin
Counci of Voluntary Agencies in Beirut; Counci
of American Volunteer A ncies in Iran; Indo-
American Agreement Relief Council; Licensed
Agencies for Relief in Asia (LARA); the Korean
Association of Voluntary Agencies (Kan);
Council of Voluntary Agencies Working in Ger-
many; the Cooperative Council of Foreign Vol-
untary Agencies in France, and the Council of
Foreign Voluntary A ncies in Poland. Some
federations, such as an, meo, Lana, and
sts, develop and carry out integrated programs
in the ﬁeld although the member agencies are in-
dependently supported at home. Others, such as
the several councils, are advisory and liaison
bodies only and the membership may include
agencies of a number of countries, particularly
those of the Commonwealth—Australia, New
Zealand, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The
prototype of these councils was the Cairo Council
of Voluntary Societies for Balkan Relief. It was
established in 1943 with representation from
' H. Rept. 1845, 80th Cong, 2d sess.
