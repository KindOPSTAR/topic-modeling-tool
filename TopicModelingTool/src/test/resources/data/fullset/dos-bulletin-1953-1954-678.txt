philosophy, as does for that matter a large part
of the Christian religion.
These two peoples of similar lan uage, history,
and culture are at each other's throats because
they each want to possess the same iece of land.
The Arabs have opposed the estab ishment of a
Jewish State in Palestine, which ancient history
as well as religion led the Jews to consider their
homeland—but which modern history has seen
in the hands of the Arabs.
The fact that the Arab and the Jew have differ-
ent though similar religions has importance only
to the degree that recent pro aganda ma have
made it seem important by cal ing on all t ose of
the Jewish faith to sup ort one side and all of
those of the Moslem falt 1 to support the other.
NEED FOR mic CHANGE IN AT‘I’I‘I'IIDI
The last fundamental I would list is one of basic
attitude. Perhaps in the end there would be no
advanta e at all in formal peace—even if it could
be quicklly obtained—unless there could be some
basic change in the attitude with which one looks
upon his neighbor. The formalities of pa r
agreements mean little if there remains therea er
contempt and sus icion. This is a matter in which
an outsider can have little inﬂuence, but he can
point out the need to display a sincere wish for
the desire for better relations if they are ever
to be attained.
In this, an attitude of $11 riority and contempt
for one’s neighbor is unlike y to cause a forthcom-
ing response. On the other hand, the world’s
history does not record that an attitude of nega-
tivism has produced beneﬁts for anyone. There
is this negativism on the Arab side and it repre-
sents a formidable obstacle for constructive solu-
tions. It seems for them ea jointly to re'ect but
difﬁcult jointly or individual y to adopt p0 icies of
a forward-looking character in connection with
this problem. This negativism seems hardened
and conﬁrmed by frontal attack, whether such at-
tack takes the form of reprisal raids or merely a
brilliant diplomatic maneuver such as the scoring
of a point in the United Nations. It can best be
arrested and gradually reduced in proportion by
undramatic and patient efforts over a period of
time. All this presupposes that the ﬁres of hatred
are not meanwhile fed. The world will carefully
watch for any indication of an adoption of a
philosophy, known to be held by a few, that the
only way to make things better is to ﬁrst make
them worse.
These are some and, again, only some of the
fundamentals that should be kept in mind when
one attempts to judge present-day situations. It
may be dangerously long before sufficient change
in some of the underlying causes for continued
strife are modiﬁed to a point where a genuine lack
of hostility can be said to exist.

In the meantime, the efforts of all concerned
should be devoted to the speciﬁc situation alon
the border. All concerned, it seems to us, should
cooperate to the utmost with local U.N. Commis-
sions and other arrangements as have in the past
been beneﬁcial, such as the Local Commander
Agreement along the borders. The Arab States
on their part should not refuse in these forums—
or in any other—to discuss ways and means of les-
sening the present-day dangers along the border
and cooperate in making preventive measures more
effective.
It is only with a decrease of immediate incidents
along the borders and a period of relative tran-
quillity that minds can turn to an honest approach
to more fundamental and underlying causes of
this dis ute. This atmosphere one would hope
would t en be conducive to face the real and per-
manent threat to the whole area. The oples of
the Middle East could then without istraction
devote more attention to the greater understand-
ing of the real oals of Soviet imperialism. With
conﬁdence esta lished in their interrelationships,
all the states of the Middle East could concentrate
and attend their energies to safeguard the precious
heritage of freedom to which we all dedicate our-
selves. For the plans of Communist imperialism
envisage the total destruction of the religion
cultures, and independence of us all. Each one 0
us must make some sacriﬁce to attain the reserva-
tion of common freedom. The United tates for
its part has shown that it is willin and anxious
to go far toward making this a rea ity.
I-‘OA Allotment for Israel
The Forei n Operations Administration an-
nounced on pril 19 that $13,125,000 in special
economic aid has been allotted to Israel for the
fourth quarter of the ﬁscal year, bringing the total
for the year to $52,500,000. For the ﬁrst three
quarters a total of $39,375,000 had been made
available to Israel under the program to provide
the nation with essential supplies, encourage ex-
port earnings, and bolster local production by
assisting in development of the economy. An
additional $1,487,000 is being devoted to the tech-
nical cooperation program.
Since the ﬁrst year, when the assistance was
directed principally toward relief, the emphasis
has shifted to development. The program today
includes building, new industry, vital reclamation
and irrigation projects, and expansion of f00d
supply. There is also extensive work under way
in the ﬁelds of education, transportation, and
public health and sanitation as part of the techni-
cal cooperation program. '
