refugee skills could be constructively used, even
though they did not rovide more than a tem-
porary reduction in t 1e ration rolls. Moreover,
they paved the way for the consideration of ion er
range development programs which would 0 er
continuing employment for refugees.
It was with such possibilities in mind that the
Director and Advisory Commission of UNRWA rec-
ommended to the General Assembly of the United
Nations a three-year “reintegration” program esti-
mated to cost $200,000,000, and relief costs esti-
mated for the same three-year period at $50,000,-
000. This program was approved by the General
Assembly on January 26, 1952.
The biggest problem faced by UNRWA in the
implementation of this program has been to ﬁnd
practicable projects at reasonable cost in countries
where the refugees are presently located, which
are politically acceptable to the governments con-
cerned. A brief description of the major efforts
and results to date follows:
Jordan. In a country of scarce resources—agri-
cultural, industrial, or mineral—and an extremely
low standard of living, develo ment prospects
were not bri ht. Attention was ocused, however,
on the ossi ility of reclaiming lands in the J or-
dan Va ley through water storage facilities and
irrigation works. A proposal was advanced in
1952 for a high dam on the Yarmuk River for
storage and power purposes, under which the
stored water of the Yarmuk would be used to irri-
gate both sides of the lower Jordan Valley within
the territory of the Kingdom of Jordan.
A program agreement was concluded between
UNRWA and Jordan under which UNRWA agreed
to reserve to December 31, 1953, $40,000,000 for
such a develo ment, rovided that it was feasible
and principal y bene ted refugees.
Before embarking on a development involving
the water interests of other countries, UNRWA de-
cided that a desk study of the Jordan Valley
waters should be made from the standpoint of
their effective and economic use under a compre-
hensive plan without regard to existing bound-
aries. T 1is study, undertaken by Charles T. Main,
Inc., under the supervision of the TVA, and com-
pleted in October 1953, resulted in a basic plan
or the uniﬁed development of the water resources
of the entire Jordan Valley. This Ian was de-
veloped without regard to olitical rontiers, and
shows how the waters of t e Jordan may be eiﬁ-
ciently stored and controlled for irrigation and
hydroelectric power. It is designed to ive max-
imum beneﬁts to all the peoples on bot sides of
the Jordan River, including the refugees, with the
least cost.
A rough cost estimate of the uniﬁed plan would
be $121,000,000, without power phases included,
and of which about $42,000,000 would be for works
in Jordan, not including land development. The
high dam on the Yarmuk is shown in this report
to be excessively costly in terms of storage for
irrigation purposes when the natural reservoirs of
Lake Tiberias could be utilized at a relatively
small cost. This does not rule out the possibility
of a lower dam on the Yarmuk designed pri-
marily for power. Of still greater importance,
far more water would be available under the uni-
ﬁed plan for irrigation of lands in the lower Jor-
dan and consequently beneﬁt a larger number of
refugees. Acce tance of the basic principle of
the plan b J or an, Syria, Lebanon, and Israel is
essential i the far-reaching beneﬁts contemplated
under it are to be realized. Without acceptance of
its basic principles, this prospect for a livelihood
for some 150-200,000 refugees in Jordan may be
lost.
In view of the economic and political importance
of the uniﬁed plan, the Presxdent sent Mr. Eric
Johnston as his Special Representative to explain
its signiﬁcance and beneﬁts to the countries con-
cerned. In the meantime, the necessary detailed
engineering surveys are proceeding on projects in
Jordan which are consistent with the plan, and on
which construction could be started within the
coming year.
Meanwhile, other rojects are in operation in
Jordan. An $11 mil ion program agreement was
concluded with Jordan in 1952 under which proj-
ects are bein undertaken to provide a living for
ap roximatelzy 6,000 refugee families (30,000
re ugees). A number of projects under this pro-
gram have been completed, including the re-estab—
lishment of villages of refugees whose homes were
formerly in Israel, but whose lands lie along the
Jordanian side of the armistice line. This ro-
gram has also included housing projects in -
man, the capital of Jordan, and several small
agricultural settlements where ground water has
been found. A vocational training program esti-
mated to cost $1 million has been undertaken to
provide technical training in vocations for which
there is a demand for trained ersons. Other
projects have included loans to private enter rises
providing employment of refugees throng the
Jordan Development Bank, part of whose capi-
tal is subscribed by UNRWA.
Syria. A $30 million program agreement has
been concluded between UNRWA and the Syrian
Government which reserves $30 million for a i-
cultural, technical training, educational and 0t er
projects to provide emp oyment for the 85,000
refugees new resident in Syria. One agricultural
settlement for 200 families (1,000 refugees) is near
completion. With regard to larger-scale projects,
the Director of UNBWA in his report to the Gen-
eral Assembly in 1953,3 stated that:
Attempts have also been made to ﬁnd areas suitable
for more signiﬁcant agricultural development, and two
survey expeditions have been made for this purpose in
north and northeast Syria. The conclusion reached as a
result of these surveys was that the area had great p0-
tentlalities and that opportunities existed on State d0-
