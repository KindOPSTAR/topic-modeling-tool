days when we were the impecunious revolutionar-
ies. Then our dynamic spirit was unobscured and
seemed to others a torch enlightening the world as
to the values inherent in liberty.
Also, the forces of despotism today are more
formidable than ever before. In the past, aggres-
sive imperialism has most often reﬂected the am-
bitions of a single nation, or of a single man. It
has never before attained the status of the well-
thought-out intellectual creed taught throughout
the world and pursued fanatically by many men
of many nations.
Today, Communist des otism, proclaiming the
so-called dictatorship of tlie roletariat, is a creed
which carries a stro appea to those who do not
have a vigorous fait in the spiritual nature of
man. It lausibly pretends to identify itself with
what it ca ls great and irresistible forces of nature
and of history.
If one does not believe in a spiritual order, if
one does not acce t the fact of moral law and what
the Virginia Bi of Rights referred to as “the
duty which we owe to our Creator,” then it is, in-
deed, diﬁicult to combat the thesis that men should
be the servants of the State; and that one State
should be the master over all other States.
If it be accepted, as a premise, that man is merely
matter, then it is easy to conclude, as the Com-
munists do, that the reatest harmony and greatest
productivity come rom organizing a society of
conformity, where diversity is treated as grlt in
the gears of a delicate machine. If all people act
only as directed, and think only as directed, and
believe only as directed, then, it is argued, there
will be none of the collisions, the disturbances,
which produce social unrest and wars. Then, it
is said, there will be eace and maximum pro-
ductivity, because we s all have applied to man
the same principles of conduct which, we ﬁnd, in-
crease peace and productivity in the case of do-
mesticated animals.
The Supremacy et Morel Law
In truth, a system of political liberty and na-
tional sovereignty is orderly and tolerable only if
the citizens exercise self-restraints and self-control
in accordance with the dictates of the moral law
and if they practice the Golden Rule. It is in-
dispensable to a free society that there be accept-
ance of the supremacy of moral law. Without
that, a free society becomes a society of intolerable
license.
You will recall that George Washington in his
Farewell Address inted out that “morality is a
necessary spring 0 popular government” and he
said it could not be supposed that morality would
be maintained without religion. Basically the
present conﬂict between freedom and despotism is
a conﬂict between a spiritual and material view
of the Universe and of the nature of man.
I do not believe that this struggle is one which
can be quickl or easily resolved. Certainly it
cannot be reso ved b any a eed partition of hu-
manity between free om an despotism.
It would be intolerable for us to concede hun-
dreds of millions of souls to despotic rule. Also,
such an arrangement would be unstable from the
standpoint of the Communists.
The Soviet rulers occasionally tell us that there
could be “coexistence” between their society and
ourselves. We must, however, beware of these
professions. Coexistence is not part of a Soviet
Communist creed or practice, except in the sense
non-Communists are allowed, in a physical sense,
to exist.
It can never be satisfactory to the Soviet Com-
munists that freedom is $11 pressed only within
what is presently the area t ey dominate. Free-
dom anywhere is a constant peril to them, for free-
dom is inherently a contagious and dynamic moral
force. Therefore, the Communists conclude that
they are required, as a “defensive” measure, to seek
to suppress freedom in their environment.
Thus Soviet Communist rulers are driven not
merely by their own lusts but by their own doc-
trine, by their own fears, to seek constantly to
extend their control.
The Pattern of Soviet Negetlatlene
So far this year, we have negotiated in good
faith with the Soviet rulers in relation to the use
of atomic energy and in relation to Germany,
Austria, Korea, and now Indochina. Always there
is a consistent pattern. Never will they relax
their grip on what they have. In each of the eo-
graphlc areas I mention, they insist upon a or-
mula which will not only assure the perpetuation
of their despotism within the areas they now con-
trol, but also allow them to apply their ruthless
methods to gain control of the areas which are still
free.
It may be asked why, if these results could have
been foreseen, we have negotiated at all.
My answer is that no man has the right to assume
that he sees the future so clearly that he is justi-
ﬁed in concluding either that war is inevitable or
that methods of conciliation are futile. Eﬁ'orts
for honorable peace are required out of a decent
respect for the opinion of mankind. Also, they
clarify the issues. That is why we resumed high-
level talks with those who proclaim themselves our
enemies, talks which had been broken off for 5
years. We have accompanied these talks with
safeguards designed to prevent the arousing of
false hopes or a rela ' of essential vigilance. We
have not compromised liberty where it prevails
within the free world and we have kept faith with
those who, having lost liberty, still covet it.
Out of talks, held under these conditions, has
at least come a demonstration of the implacable
purpose of the rulers of the Soviet Communist
bloc.
