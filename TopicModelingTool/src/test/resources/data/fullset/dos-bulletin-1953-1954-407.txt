liefs rest on conﬁdence in what President Eisen-
hower recently called “the expansive ower of
individual enterprise.” This is the revo utionary
idea which, recognized or not, was so important
in releasing human energies from the restraints of
feudalism. The ex ansive power of individual
enterprise again p ayed a dramatic role when
hemis heric trade came to ﬂourish with the break-
in o the bonds of colonialism. We reafﬁrm our
faith in this constructive and ex ansive force.
The reaﬁirmation of these be iefs has led us
to reexamine the roper role of government in
modern society. any of you have read the
words of our President in his Economic Report
to the Congress.‘
May I quote from one section:
The Government can greatly help to maintain pros-
perity. But it is well to recall the accumulated experi-
ence of generations which has taught us that no Govern-
ment can of itself create real and lasting prosperity. A
thriving economy depends fundamentally on the enter-
prise of millions of individuals, acting in their own
interests and in the interests of their families and com-
munities.
The President then went on to say:
The best service that the Government can render our
economy, besides helping to maintain stability and in-
suring a ﬂoor of protection for the population, is therefore
to create an environment in which men are eager to make
new jobs, to acquire new tools of production, to improve
or scrap the old ones, design new products and develop
new markets, increase efﬁciency all around, and thus be
able and willing to pay higher wages and provide better
working conditions. The Federal GOvernment is foster-
ing and will continue to foster this kind of environment.
We believe that the role of government in the
economy is to nurture and promote individual ef-
fort and not to replace it. In carryin this prin-
ciple into action, the United States overnment
is pledged to maintain fair and equitable condi-
tions under which our business enterprises, large
and small, and our workers can operate most ef-
ﬁciently.
The dignity and worth of each individual in
our society is one of our most sacred values. My
Government shares with the Governments of the
other American countries the objective of making
these values a living reality.
In your statements you have indicated an in-
terest in the economic situation and outlook in
the United States.
U. S. Economle Conditions
Our economy in 1953 achieved a gross national
product of $367 billion—the highest on record,
and 5 percent larger than in 1952. Civilian em-
ployment averaged 61.9 million for the year.
Unemployment, although increasing at the end
of the year, averaged 11/2 million, the lowest of
all postwar years. Thus the economy had some

of the characteristics of a business boom. As we
move into 1954, production is down about 10 per-
cent from its highest point and there is some
increase in unemployment, though not beyond a.

Iéliat we have been experiencing is a transition
from a wartime economy to one more nearly ad-
justed to peace. We appear to be making that
ad'ustment without disturbance.
arm roduction in 1953 was high but prices
fell for t e second successive year. Lower agri-
cultural exports added to our domestic farm
problem.
In foreign trade, United States exports of non-
military goods to all countries in 1953 were $12.2
billion, about $1 billion less than in 1952. At
the same time that our exports declined, our total
imports rose slightly to $10.9 billion in 1953. Our
exports to Latin America were about 15 percent
less than in 1952, amounting to $3.1 billion, while
our imports were $3.4 billion, about the same as
in the previous ear. Latin America thus con-
tinued to provi e about one-third of our total
imports, exceeding those from any other area in
the world.
Our banking system, our insurance companies,
and other ﬁnancial institutions have operated
conservatively and are in a strong osition. The
general price level has been sta le. Plans of
United States private business for new investment
in lant and uipment, and projects of States
an munici alities, indicate continued heavy ex-
penditures or new capital investment.
These and other factors provide the basis for
conﬁdence in the economic outlook.
Your interest in the growth and stability of our
country is equaled by our abiding interest in eco-
nomic conditions in your countries. We fully
recognize the problems facing various countries
as their delegates have described them in these
meetings. We are profoundly impressed, how-
ever, by the great progress w ich countr after
country has made toward the solution of these
problems, each working with its problems in its
own way. -
Output in Latin America in the postwar period
has increased by almost 5 percent annually. This
is nothing short of spectacular. It exceeds the
recent rate of growth in the United States. These
gains have been based lar 1y on the utilization
of domestic resources. Yggur own people pro-
vided most of the capital, and their enterprise put
the capital to work.
Foreign capital can hasten the development
process. It will be attracted by conditions that
promise fair treatment, stability, and a return
which is interesting in relation to the returns
elsewhere.
Tax and Treaty Matters
To provide incentives for an increased ﬂow of
private capital abroad, President Eisenhower has
