We are there of our own free will—because our
French friends wanted us to be there and also
because we believed it was in the interest of our
own security for us to be there. We want to stay
there, and, if conditions are such as to give us a
modicum of faith in the future, I believe we will
stay there as lon as we are needed. And we
would do so, I think, for the 00d and sufﬁcient
reason that we are convinced t at, if the United
States had been in Europe in 1914 and 1939 and
if the war-lords of those eras had known for sure
that we would intervene, then neither the Kai-
ser nor Hitler would have ever begun their
aggressions.
Therefore we feel that the presence of the
United States in Europe now is a deterrent to any
would-be dictator or war-10rd.
We point out the following utterly salient and
basic fact—that with us in the picture any poten-
tial German numerical superiority will be com-
pletely balanced.
But, of course, we can only be there as part of
a total European defense so intelligently organ-
ized that it would in the tragic event of war have
a reasonable chance of success.
The question of creating a European Defense
Community is therefore, a question of the lar est
moment for all of us. While we naturally un er-
stand the emotions which it evokes we regard it as
utterly vital to the future of free peoples. We see
no acceptable alternative. For these reasons we
welcome the decision of the French Government to
hold the ratiﬁcation debate in the immediate
future.
I say all this both as a friend of France and as
a man with 13 years of service in the United States
Senate behind him who took an active part in
1951 in the Senate debate on the sending of the
six United States divisions to Europe. These are
opinions based on long experience and offered in
friendship.
They are offered in the unquestioning faith that
our two countries, which have meant so much to
each other throughout history, will continue on-
ward together, animated by that belief in the
rights 0 man which has always bound them to-
gether.

I propose tonight to speak to you as a reporter,
though perhaps some of you would refer that
I assume the role of pro het. For I ave found
in private conversations in the last few days that
many people are more interested in what is going
to happen in Europe in the coming months than
in an analysis of the situation that now exists.
This is particularly true in regard to the plans for
the European Defense Community whose fate de-
pends on the vote of the French Assembly when
the ratiﬁcation of the Eco treaty comes up for
debate next month. I have repeatedly said that
to in mind there is no practical alternative to
the no and therefore I believe the E00 treaty
would be ratiﬁed by all six nations. I repeat that
statement again; but beyond that, I intend to re-
sist the temptation to indulge in a prophecy to-
night. Years ago when I was a chemistry pro-
fessor I learned a lesson in this regard. Like
many teachers of chemistry in college, I used to

employ the device of lecture-table experiments
often involving explosions to keep my class awake.
However the ex eriments were not always suc-
cessful; the redicted explosions sometimes failed
to occur. A er one such ﬁasco, an elderly gentle-
man in the audience who was there as a listener
came up after the lecture and offered the followin
advice: Young man, it is always better to spe
after the event as an historian rather than before
the event as a prophet. Following this sound pre-
cept, I propose to place my remarks about Ger-
many in an historical framework this evening.
I can do this the more readin because it so
happens that as a young chemist I was in Germany
for 8 months 7 years after the end of World War
I. As United States High Commissioner for Ger-
many, I once again entered that country 7 years
after the end of another world war. Therefore, in
the past 12 months or more there have constantly
come to my mind comparisons between what I saw
and heard in Germany in 1925 and what I have
seen and heard in the past year. As a young pro-
