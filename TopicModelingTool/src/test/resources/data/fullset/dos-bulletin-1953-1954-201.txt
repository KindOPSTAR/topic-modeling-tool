people would have freedom to work out its own
destiny in its own way; how to achieve unity with-
out satellitism; how to ﬁnd ways in which one
form of democrac , such as that of Jefferson and
Lincoln, can wor closely with other forms of
democracy such as those of a Britain, a Sweden,
an Israel, and others; how to ﬁnd new patterns
of international economic life so that countries
that are far from being self-sufﬁcient and are de-
pendent upon foreign trade for the livelihood of
their citizens can ﬁnd markets and obtain goods
and materials. These were—and are—some of the
substantive questions to confront American
diplomacy.
Along with these problems of goals and objec-
tives there were equa 1y difficult roblems of meth-
ods and procedure. How do wi ely separated and
differing peoples go about the job of evolving
common olicies? For one thing it was obvious
that the familiar tendency to regard a country’s
foreign policy as something that could be con-
structed y the intellectual process of working out
a syllogism would no longer do. This, I would
like to suggest, incidentally, is one of the most im-
portant objectives in public education in the ﬁeld
of international policy in all of our countries
today.
Every profession has its articular intellectual
disci line. The way in which a doctor diagnoses
an i1 ness is different from the process of thought
by which a judge decides a difficult legal problem.
In the ﬁeld of geometry and physics it is appro-
priate and essential to employ the method of the
syllogism: all solids have a speciﬁc gravity; gran-
ite is a solid; therefore granite as a speciﬁc
avity.
The point that I would like to make is that not
only is that type of thought process not applicable
to the ﬁeld of foreign policy, but the tendency of
many people in many of our countries to employ
'it is a danger to international peace. The reason
why it is dangerous is this. Each country can
Belect its own remises and can construct its own
syllogisms. “ emocracy is good. My country is
a democracy. Therefore everything that my
country does and wants is right.” But the prem-
ises available to different countries are inﬁnite
and the conﬂicting conclusions of their airtight
syllogisms do not solve problems. The create
new ones. It is important for us to rea ize that
there are many truths and many goods. Oliver
Wendell Holmes once received a letter introducing
Someone as “a man of principle.” Holmes wrote
back saying that he would have no time for him; a
man who only had one principle was woefully
equipped and not worth meeting.
Instead of regarding policy formulation as
something that can be arrived at in the manner of
a syllogism, it is more valid to regard it as a prob-
lem of arriving at a vector of moral forces. You
remember how, when we were in high school, we
were given problems that posed a force of 2 pounds
going in one direction, a 10- and force in an-
other, a 6-pound force in anot er and a 12-pound
force in still another. The pro lem was to de-
termine the net direction from this combination
of forces.
Our problems today exist precisely because
there are conﬂicting rights, conﬂictin claims,
duties and allegiances. The task there ore is es-
sentially one of identifying them, assigning to
each its just moral weig t, of ﬁnding a solution
that will meet as many of them as possible, and,
where they cannot all be met, of determining a line
of action that will be as equitable as possible. An
inculcation of an instinctive approach of this
nature to the problems of our day would go far
toward a mammum achievement of the goals we
all so ardently desire.
Only in this way can we succesfully go about
resolvmg such momentous conﬂicts, for instance,
as that between the need for developing the unity
of free peoples while preserving the essential d1-
versity which is the essence and expression of free-
dom. Only in this way can we strengthen the
bonds that must exist among groups in various
countries dedicated to the democratic idea without
interfering with the sovereignty and rights of the
nations in which they live and to which they give
their affection and allegiance; or strive toward
peace and at the same time make sure that security
against aggression is not allowed to remain dis-
astrously weak; make sure, that is, that we shall
have no more Koreas with their frightful toll.
All of these have come to be among the rinci al
tasks of modern di lomacy. They have eman ed
the attributes which Harold Nicolson deﬁned as
essential for a diplomat: accuracy, calm, patience,
good temper, modesty, lo alty, intelligence, knowl-
edge, discernment, pru ence, industry, courage,
and tact. But above all they require integrity and
friendly understanding.
