I» “HIST-Am mom
On 25 May 1952 elections for new Communal
Councils took place throughout the Zone. In the
Communes of Trieste and Muggia the “linked-
list” system, under which the party or group of
“linked” parties polling the greatest number of
votes secures two-thirds of the seats in the Council,
was used for the ﬁrst time. In the remaining
Communes a system of proportional representa-
tion was employed.
The total number of registered electors was
217,241 representing 73.34 per cent of the popula-
tion resident in the Zone on 4 November 1951. The
number of votes cast was 197,228 or 94.03 per cent
of the electorate. Valid v'otes totalled 193,886,
98.03 per cent of all votes cast.
In the Commune of Trieste a total of 178,984
valid votes were cast. divided between 14 electoral
lists. Of these the “linked-list” comprising the
Christian Democrat. Liberal, Republican, and
Venezia Giulia Socialist Parties polled 83,753
votes (46.79 er cent), thus securing 40 of the 60
seats on the uncil. The Communist Party se-
cured 6 seats, and the Independence Front, and the
Italian Social Movement (Neo-fascist) linked
with the National Monarchist Party secured 5
each.
In the Commune of Muggia the F. T. T. Com-
munist Party lead with 58.30 per cent of the valid
votes cast, followed by the Christian Democrat
Group with 21.12 per cent.
In the other Communes the successful parties
were respectively: San Dorligo della Valle,
F. T. T. Communist Party with 49.31 per cent;
Duino-Aurisina, Slovene Union with 42.90 per
cent; Sgonico, Slovene Union with 50.98 per cent;
and Monrupino, Slovene Union with 53.48 r
cent. A detailed analysis of the electorate an of
how they used their votes is contained in Ap-
pendices N and N1.
Section IX—Pllbllc SM
Apart from a disturbance connected with the
anniversary of the Tripartite declaration of 20
March 1948, the year 1952 was a one from the
standpoint of law and order. No case of murder
was reported and there was a considerable decrease
in the number of crimes.
Crime statistics are given at Appendix 0.
ﬁction X—Dlsplleed Persons and Refugee:
The number of refugees entering the Zone dur-
ing the S ring and Summer pro essively dimin-
ished. e camp population fe 1 from 4,218 on
31 December 1951 to 3,443 at the end of Jul 1952.
The ﬂow then took an upward trend and y the
end of the year the ﬁgure stood at 3,924.
Migration activities continued, but it became
more difﬁcult to settle refu ees overseas mainly
for reasons connected with imitations on immi-
gration opportunities in overseas areas. Never-
theless, departures during the year numbered 2,416
a inst 2,018 arrivals. The countries of origin
0 these arrivals and other statistics concernnig
refugees and o tants are given at Appendix
The International Refugee Or nization ceased
operations early in the year an was succeeded
by the Provisional Inter- overnmental Commit-
tee for the Movement of Iigrants from Europe.
This or anization, later renamed Inter-govern~
mental ommittee for European Migration, estab-
lished a branch oﬂice in Trieste, and together with
the already established welfare organization ren-
dered most valuable assistance.
The position of aged and inﬁrm refugees still
presents many diﬁiculties, but Switzerland, Nor-
way, and Sweden generously provided permanent
homes for many of these unfortunates. Eﬂ'orts
on their behalf continue, and construction of a
new camp was started where they can be accom-
modated in more suitable surroundings. The
tubercular sanitorium, referred to in my last re-
port, was completed and is in full use. It has
greatly facilitated the work of the medical staff
in examining all refugees, and has also shown
encouraging results in checking the course and
diffusion of this disease. The health of the
refugees in general also improved.
In marked contrast to the movement of refugees,
the inﬂux of optants for Italian nationality from
that part of Venezia Giulia ceded to Yugoslavia
under the provisions of the Italian Peace Treaty
has practically ceased. Whereas in 1951 there
were 5,587 such optants, in 1952 their number fell
to 78.
