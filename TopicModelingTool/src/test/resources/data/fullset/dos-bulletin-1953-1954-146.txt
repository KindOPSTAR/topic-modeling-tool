the latter, then those who did not wish to return
were not so subject. The Communists do not, of
course, recognize God. They invoke instead the
historical imperative and Marxism~Leninism.
For our art, we were determined that history
would f0 ow not Marxism-Leninism or even the
teachin of Mao Tse-tung but the im rative of
God, w 0 had endowed man with in erent and
unalienable rights.
The question of which side would revail on
this crucial point was the issue of t e Korean
war long after the a gression had been repelled.
We were determined that not one Chinese or
Korean that we held as a prisoner of war would
be forced to return to the tyranny he abhorred.
And in the end— robably because the Commu-
nists understood t at we were ready to resort to
more far-reaching measures than we had so far
applied—we won on this rinciple as we had on
the principle of repelling t e ag ession. At this
very time, 22,000 Chinese and orean prisoners
of war, determined to resist return to Communist
control, are being freed as civilians in accordance
with the terms of the armistice the Communists
accepted 6 months ago today. This is a great
occasion in the history of mankind.
The Communists must take into account that,
in any future conflict between the Communist
world and the free world, the unwilling soldiers
on their side will be able to escape their tyrann
by taking asylum with free nations. This rea -
ization, like the defeat of their aims in Korea,
will be a powerful deterrent to future aggression.
The present greatly diminished prospect of war
will, in my opinion, be recognized by history
as a great victory for our side, a victory achieved
in Korea and also, I should add, through NATO.
But let us remember that our increased immunity
from Communist attack is entirely and com-
pletely, and in every sense, a function of our ability
to withstand such an attack. The moment the
Communists conclude we have lost that ability,
we shall stand in mortal ril.
And that is not all. t as not imagine that,
because in Moscow’s and Peiping’s view an attack
on the free world under present circumstances
would not be proﬁtable, anything has been
“settled” between the Communist world and our
own. Nothing whatsoever has been settled. The
issues are precisely what the were before the
attack on the Republic of orea. The Com-
munists are as determined as ever to destroy all
centers of resistance to their ideology and to the
agencies of their power. They have simply, for
the present, adopted different techniques
We may expect them now to concentrate on
strengthening themselves and weakening us by
means other than waging open war against us.
We may expect Moscow and Peiping to continue
sacriﬁcing the welfare of the Russian and Chinese
peoples to the building up of the industrial base
that will be required for their huge military ma-
chines of the future. We may expect them to con-
tinue supporting and revisioning uprisings and
rebellions against lega governments in the free
world such as they are now doing in Indochina,
where a situation of great danger to us exists. We
may expect them to redouble their efforts to ex-
ploit sources of discontent and revolt amon the
“have-nots” of the free world; to sow and oster
confusion, suspicion, and hatred; to set class
against class, color against color, nation against
nation. We may expect them to redouble their
efforts to poison the minds of other peoples against
the United States, to insist that it is only the anti-
socialistic warmongering elements of capitalistic
America that stand in the we of a universal peace.
Every Communist voice telling us that all will be
hap y and peaceful if only we make the next two
or tiiree concessions will be matched by voices on
our own side explaining, in one way or another,
how vigilance and preparedness are somehow un-
worthy of us and, in any case, are costly and
unnecessary.
The period into which we are now entering will
be one of increased rather than diminished difﬁ-
culty. War is a marvelous instrument for making
the issues of a struggle graphic and unmistakable,
for keeping people s resolution up to the mark, for
calling forth sacriﬁces and endurance. In a pe-
riod of peace we shall be under strong tem tation
to excuse ourselves from the hard tasks t at the
contest with the Communist camp en'oins upon us.
It will be easy to rationalize our esire to give
ourselves up to all the material leasures and com-
forts that are so effectively a vertised to us in
every newspa r, magazine, and broadcast and to
be untroub edpleiy responsibilities in distant lands.
It will be easy to believe that the Communists have
somehow changed, that they are becoming subject
to the softening inﬂuences that so often overtake
militant movements.
I pra that we may resist these temptations. It
is only y resisting them, by reminding ourselves
unceasingly that Communist ambitions and pur-
poses have not undergone the least modiﬁcation
that we ma hope to escape a ﬁnal reckoning by
force with t e Communist world—a military show-
down on terms advantageous to them, in circum-
stances of their own choosing. The question is
whether we shall hold onto the advantage we won
in Korea at such a fearful cost of blood and labor.
It may appear from what I have said that, in
my opinion, the best we can do is to hold our own
against the Communists and that we must reconcile
ourselves to a passive defense and acquiescence in
Communist control over a third of the earth’s
population. That is far from what I mean. If
you asked me what kind of resolution of the all-
encompassing struggle with the tyrannical empire
of the Communists we may look forward to, I
should give you a very simple answer. Commu-
nism is a movement that cannot survive without
expanding. It cannot remain static. The strength
