for Afghanistan Aid
Press release 152 dated March 23
The Governments of the United States and
Afghanistan on March 20 signed an agreement
un er which the United States will provide 12,000
tons of wheat or wheat ﬂour to meet a threatened
food shortage in Afghanistan. The aid will be
sent under section 550 of the Mutual Security Act
of 1951, as amended,1 which authorizes the use of
mutual security funds to ﬁnance thexpurchase of
su lus agricultural commodities pr need in the
United States. It further authorizes the President
to enter into a cements with friendly countries
for the sale andr export of these commodities and
the acceptance of local currencies in payment.
This agreement was entered into at the request
of the Government of Afghanistan, which found
that the food requirements of its people could not
be met during the coming months without outside
assistance.
The Afghan funds received in payment for the
wheat or wheat ﬂour will be used, as authorized by
the mutual security legislation, for helping in the
economic development of Afghanistan.
The Foreign Operations Administration will

U.S.—Philippine Consultations
on Trade Relations
Press release 151 dated March 22
Following is the text of an announcement made
on March 22 by the U.S. and Philippine Govern-
ments:
The American Embassy in Manila has advised
President Magsaysay that the Government of the
United States, after reviewing the Philippine pro-
posals relating to the provisions of the 1946 Trade
Agreement concerning trade, ﬁnance, treatment of
investment, and immigration,2 is prepared to con-
sult with the Philippine Government on possible
modiﬁcations of the present Agreement.
The United States is also prepared to consider
commercial matters not covered by this Agreement
which may be of mutual interest to both countries.
In agreeing to such consultations, however, the
United States indicated that, while it is prepared
to consider possible' alternative tariff arrange-
ments, it does not believe that the selective free
trade proposal advanced by the Philippine Gov-
ernment in its note of May 5, 1953,8 offers a satis-
factory basis for future trade relations.
Any change of the existing Agreement would
require action by the Congresses of both Govern-
ments.
In conjunction with the decision to enter into
consultations, President Magsaysay requested that
the reciprocal free-trade period rovided for in
the present A cement be exten ed for eighteen
months beyon July 3, 1954. It was agreed that
the Congresses of both countries would be re-
quested to enact appropriate legislation imple-
menting this request. ,
