Prime Minister Yoshida of J apan has indeﬁ-

ing a Visit to the nited States. An invitation to
visit the United States was extended to the Prime
Minister through Secretary Dulles last year and
Mr. Yoshida had been tentatively scheduled to
arrive in Washington on June 7.
The United States Government regrets that the
Prime Minister’s visit has been postponed but it
is hoped that he will be able to come to this country
at some later time. Such a visit would provide an
opportunity to discuss matters of mutual interest
to the United States and Japan and would con-
tribute to the steadily increasing bonds of friend-
ship between the people of the two countries.
