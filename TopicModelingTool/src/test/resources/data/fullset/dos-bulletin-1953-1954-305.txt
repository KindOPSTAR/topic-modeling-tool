TRIPARTITE COMMUNIQUE
OF FEBRUARY 19
Press release 80 dated February 19
The major problem facing the Berlin conference
was that of Germany. The three Western dele-
gations urged that the reuniﬁcation of Germany
should be achieved through free elections, leadin
to the creation of an all-German Government witlg
which a peace treaty could be concluded. They
put forward a practical plan to this end. Their
proposals were not accepted by the Soviet delega-
tion, even as a basis for discussion, and they were
forced to the conclusion that the Soviet Govern-
ment is not now ready to permit free all-German
elections, or to abandon its control over Eastern
Germany.
The three Western Governments will continue
their eﬂ'orts to achieve German reuniﬁcation in
freedom and by peaceful means. In the meantime,
they have suggested certain measures which could
reduce the effect of the present division of Ger-
many and its consequences for Berlin. They have
proposed that the three High Commissioners
should study these questions with the Soviet High
Commissioner. As regards Berlin, the three Gov-
ernments reaﬁirm their abiding 1nterest_ in the
security of the city as expressed in the Tripartite
Declaration of May 27, 1952. They will do all in
their power to improve conditions in Berlin and
to romote the economic welfare of the city.
be three Western Ministers did their utmost to
secure agreement 11 on the Austrian State Treaty.
They accepted the oviet version of all the remain-
in disagreed articles. The Austrian Foreign
Minister, who was present at all the discussions on
this question, declared himself ready to Sign the
treaty in this form. The Soviet Foreign Minister,
however, insisted upon adding new provisions to
the treaty. The effect of these would have been to
leave foreign troops in Austria for an indeﬁnite
period after the entry into force of the treaty, and
to impair Austria’s right to play her full part in
international life.
The treaty could therefore not be concluded in
Berlin, des ite an Austrian offer acce ted by the
Western Ministers, that troops of the our Powers
should remain in Austria until the 30th of June
1955. The three Governments are repared to
continue their efforts to conclude t e Austrian
State Treaty, but progress depends on the Soviet
Union modifying its attitude. Meanwhile, they
will continue to seek every means of llghtening
the burden of occupation on Austria.
The three Governments remain ready to take ad-
vantage of any further 0p ortunity which may
arise to promote, by renewa of the contacts estab-
lished at Berlin or by other means, a solution of
the German and Austrian problems.
The three Ministers explained and reafﬁrmed
the purely defensive character of Western security
arrangements.
Oﬁ'ers were made to discuss how the undertak-
ings which already protect the Soviet Union
against aggression could be reinforced. The
Soviet delegation made no response to these offers.
Their own proposals would have involved the dis-
solution of the Western securit system, while the
military power of the Soviet 100 in Europe re-
mained intact. The Three Powers do not intend
to be deﬂected from their efforts to develop the
system of defense on which their survival depends.
SOVIET PROPOSAL OF FEBRUARY 12
REGARDING AUSTRIA
The Governments of the Union of Soviet Socialist Re
puhllcs, France, the United Kingdom and the United
States of America recognize that the interests of consoli-
dating peace in Europe and the need to ensure the na-
tional rights of the Austrian people require an early re-
establishment of a free and independent Austria, and
that the settlement of the Austrian question should con-
form to the existing four-power agreements.
