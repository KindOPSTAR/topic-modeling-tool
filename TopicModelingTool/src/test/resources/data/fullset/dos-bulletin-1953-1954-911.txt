If this erosion were to continue above the head
of Goat Island, it would result in drying u the
American Falls entirely. The Horseshoe alls
might develop into a series of rapids, with conse-
quent loss to posterity of all the grandeur and
romance of the resent s ectacle. This would be
a catastrophe or whic we would be greatly
blamed—and rightly so—by generations yet to
come.
The falls, as they exist, present a majestic and
awe-inspiring spectacle during cycles of high ﬂow
in the Nia ara River. However, as the levels of
the upper akes dro and the discharge decreases,
the white sheet of t e American Falls loses some
of its beauty. A broken crest line and bare ﬂanks
develop in the larger falls, while excessive ﬂows
continue to concentrate in the apex of the Horse-
shoe, where erosion is greatest.
By the Niagara River Diversion Treaty of 1950,
the Governments of the United States and Canada
joined together to accomplish two purposes. One
was to put to beneﬁcial use for power the water
not essential to maintain the scenic spectacle. The
other was to preserve, for resent and future gen-
erations, the splendor of the view that is now be-
fore us. This will be accom lished through a
diversion of surplus water and y a careful redis-
tribution of the rest along the Horseshoe and the
American Falls.
The two purposes to which I referred are both
purposes for w ich I can, ofﬁcially as well as er-
sonally, take pleasure at this time. The deve o -
ment of hydroelectric power, which will be possib e
through this work, gives me cause to rejoice as the
Minister in charge of the federal aspect of our
natural resources, and especially water resources.
But I can also rejoice at the more aesthetic and
less purely practical aspect of this occasion.
As the Canadian mlnister responsible for the
National Parks of Canada, I take great satisfac-
tion in being here. It is a pleasure to have the op-
portunity to visit again this great park which
the Province of Ontario, through the Niagara
Parks Commission, has restored and preserved
for us and for the future. Like most Canadians,
I have watched with admiration and respect the
development of plans for the improvement of
these park lands and those which have been estab-
lished just across the river by the Niagara Frontier
State Parks Commission. We must all be grate-
ful for the imagination and determination of an
earlier generation which ﬁrst saw the value of the
park lands surrounding the falls. In 1885, the
parks system on this side of the river started with
only 554 acres, but it was a magniﬁcent start which
marked the end of long years during which no
action had been taken to preserve this heritage.
Today the parks, the driveways, the remarkable
gardens, the priceless historic sites, are spread
over some 3,000 acres. This has been a great work
for which the parks ofﬁcials deserve the congratu-
iations and admiration of every visitor who comes
ere.
The International Joint Commission, and the
engineers and advisers who are associated with it,
deserve the thanks of every visitor for the patient
and unspectacular, but tremendous, work which
they have done to preserve this waterway. The
have had the full cooperation of Government 0 -
ﬁcials of both countries, of the parks authorities,
and of the power interests. Special credit should
be given to the Hydro-Electric Power Commission
of Ontario and to the Corps of Engineers of the
United States Army which provided most of the
men and machines necessary for the preservation
of these works.
The efforts of all these men, whether they were
engaged in the physical job of digging the mas-
sive rock of the river bed or whether they labored
in ofﬁces over painstakin re orts and careful ne-
gotiations, bore fruit in t e iagara River Diver-
sion Treaty of 1950. All of us as citizens of our
respective countries can congratulate ourselves on
that treaty, which was one of the most important
conservation measures our two countries have ever
jointly undertaken.
It is a source of gratiﬁcation to me, as I am sure
it is to all who are present today, that I shall not
have to tell my children that, when they grow up,
they will know the magniﬁcence of Niagara Falls
only through old photographs in the geography
books. Nature and the work of man have vastly
changed the scene which greeted Father Hennepin.
I hope, however, that the work which our genera-
tion is undertaking today will allow the visitor to
this spot in another 100 years still to sense the
feeling which overcame Charles Dickens when he
wrote:
“It was not until I came on Table Rock, and
looked—great Heaven, on what a fall of bright-
green waterl—that it came upon me in its full
might and majesty.
“Then, when I felt how near to my Creator I
was standing, the ﬁrst eﬁ'wt, and the enduring
one—instant and lasting—of the tremendous spec-
tacle, was Peace. Peace of mind, tranquility,
calm recollections of the dead, great thoughts of
eternal rest and happiness: nothing of gloom or
terror. Niagara was at once stamped upon my
heart, an image of beauty; to remain there, change-
less and indelible, until its pulses cease to beat,
for ever.”
