may form a provisional all-German authority charged with
assisting the assembly in drafting a constitution and with
preparing the nucleus of future all-German ministries. If
the assembly so decides the authority may also open with
the four powers, on a preliminary basis, negotiations for
a peace treaty.
IV. Adoption ol the Constitution and Formation of
an Ail-German Government Responsible for the
Negotiation ot the Peace Treaty
The constitution will be submitted to the assembly as
soon as possible after the final draft has been agreed.
immediately it has been adopted, an all-German govern-
ment will be formed. This government will then be re-
sponsible for the negotiation and conclusion of the peace
treaty. At the same time, such other institutions as may
be provided for in the constitution shall be established.
As soon as the ail-German government has been formed,
the national assembly will determine how the powers of
the Federal government and the German authorities in the
Soviet zone shall be transferred to the ail-German govern-
ment and how the two former shall be brought to an end.
The all-German government shall have the authority to
assume the international rights and obligations of the
Federal Republic and the Soviet zone of Germany and to
conclude such other international agreements as it may
wish.
Until entry into force of the peace treaty each of the
four powers will exercise with respect to the national
assembly and the all-German government only those of its
rights which relate to the stationing of armed forces in
Germany and the protection of their security, Berlin, the
reuniﬁcation of Germany and a peace treaty.
Decisions of the national assembly and the all-German
government in carrying out this plan will not require the
approval of the four powers. Such decisions may not be
disapproved except by majority vote of the four powers.
V. Signature and Entry Into Force at the Peace
Treaty
Signatories to the treaty should include all states or the
successors thereof which were at war with Germany. The
treaty should enter into force when ratiﬁed by the four
powers and by Germany.
