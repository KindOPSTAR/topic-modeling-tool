Foreign Trade and Military Policy
by H. Strwve Hansel
Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security A {fairs ‘
Military considerations must be given more and
more weight in the determination of our economic
and foreign-trade olicies. The external dan ers
and threats faced this Nation are real. T ey
will not go away wlilen we close our eyes.
We can no longer retire behind two wide oceans
and concentrate our attentions on our own re-
sources and domestic capabilities. We are a part—
although a very large part—of a turbulent globe.
Our enemies have marshaled all their abilities—
economic, militar , political, and propaganda— in
a cold-blooded e ort to destroy us.
Since we are determined to survive, our “Num-
ber 1” resolution must be to use all our abilities in
our own defense. And our foreiEp-trade policy
can be turned to real account in t ' struggle.
The effect of military considerations on national
trade policies is not a new idea. Our economists
for many years have been willing to limit the rule
of “maximum competition in the interests of
greater over-all efﬁciency” to domestic trade. Free
com etition in international trade was considered
idea istic but impractical. None of us were will-
in to risk militarily important industries for the
sa e of an economic theory. We were all willing
to pay that hidden “sales tax” called a “protective
tariﬁ’ in order to have our essential productive
capacities under our own ﬂag. As a result we have
a solid and broad industrial base for our military
strength. It is one of our major assets.
The princi le of shaping trade policies to ﬁt
military need; is still sound. The military con-
siderations have, however, changed. Some of the
changes have escaped notice exce t in military
circles. For instance, as Canada developed into
an industrial nation, it was realized that Canadian
production is almost as available to us as roduc-
tion in the continental United States. n fact
roduction in Canada is perhaps more accessible
t an production under the American ﬂag in Hawaii

or Alaska. Raw materials in Mexico and the Car-
ibbean countries are practically a part of our do-
mestic arsenal. Geographical y they are nearby,
and the lines of communication are relatively easy
to keep 0 en. We therefore have no military pur-
pose in iscouraging industrial growth in such
countries. \Ve have, on the contrary, sound mili-
tary reasons to encourage such growth, and our
trade policies should be adapted to achieve that
en .
In \Vorld War II we made a more ainful dis-
covery about war and foreign trade. e learned
that many of our domestic resources were insufﬁ-
cient for war re uirements. The seemingly end-
less resources of t e Mesabi range began to shrink.
The demands upon our petroleum resources loomed
larger and larger in proportion to our supply. We
learned that many necessary products such as man-
ganese, tungsten, tin, chrome, and even bauxite
never existed in sufﬁcient uantities within our
own borders. We, the wea thiest nation, took a
lesson from the squirrels and started a stockpile
of strategic materials. We are still maintaining
such a stockpile, and we are still aware of our de-
pendence on outside sources for war materials.
So much for the lessons we have already learned.
Unfortunately, the world never stands still. There
are further modiﬁcations to be made in our tradi-
tional trade policies which are being dictated by
military considerations.
Our Need for Allies
Today for military reasons, if for none other,
we are moving toward freer international trade.
That sounds like a contradiction, but it is not. The
basic principle is the same. A new military need
has come to the forefront. \Ve need allies. The
United States in spite of our tremendous strength,
cannot 0 it alone. This is no confession of weak-
ness. t is a recognition of reality. The old
delicate balances among many powers are one.
There are two camps—the free world an the
Communists. In between these is a void. Our free
world needs the collective and ﬁrmly united
strength of all its members.
