Sale of Merchant Vessels
to Phlllpplne Interests
Statement by James D. Bell
Oﬁi'cer in Charge, Philippine Affairs“
Because the Philippine Republic consists of
7,000 islands, some 300 of which are inhabited,
interisland shipping is essential to the very exist-
ence of the country. For all practical purposes
all Philippine exports and imports ﬂow through
only three Philippine cities.
More than four-ﬁfths of Philippine eXports
must be brou ht to these three centers by vessels
in the interis and trade. During the war prac-
tically all vessels in this trade were destroyed.
The maintenance of a ﬂeet of interisland vessels
is essential to a viable economy in the Phili pines
and is important to the economy of the nited
States by serving the areas that roduce sugar,
co ra, hemp, lumber, chrome, an manganese.
ince the liberation of the Phili pines the ei ht
vessels which the Congress woulg authorize or
sale to Philippine interests by S. J. Resolution 72
have played a major role in maintaining the vital
arteries of commerce in the Phili ines. They
contribute about one-half of the Phlﬂl) pine inter-
island ﬂeet. Their withdrawal wou d place a

serious obstacle in the continuance of the normal
economy and trade of the Philip ines.
It is the Department of States understanding
that these vessels are of types for which there has
been little or no demand by U.S. shipowners. If
these vessels cannot be sold or the charters con-
tinued, considerable expense would be incurred
to return them to the United States where they
would robably have to be ut in the “laid up ’
ﬂeet. t is the belief of the epartment of State
that the approval of legislation permitting the
sale of these vessels for use in Philippine inter-
island trade would be of beneﬁt ﬁnancially to the
U.S. Government and of very considerable
assistance in maintaining the economy of the
Philip ines.
As t e Committee is aware, the Philippine Em-
bassy in Washington expressed its news in a
note dated Ma 8, 1953, a co y of which was fur-
nished to the ommittee on uly 8, 1953.
The Department of State strongly supports the
enactment of S. J. Resolution 72.
