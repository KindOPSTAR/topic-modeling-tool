in to ask for clariﬁcation, explanations, and pro-
cedure. At the outset, let me say I do not think
any representative of the Department of State
should appear in public to discuss foreign eco-
nomic problems without assuring his audience on
basic fundamental Administration policy, which
I regret to report is not always clearly) appreciated.
Secretar of State John Foster u les has re-
cently sai , “The basic purpose of our foreign
policy is today what it always has been—to protect
the interests of the United States.”
And in his State of the Union Message 1 month
ago the President said, “At this moment, we are
in transition from a wartime to a peacetime econ-
omy. I am conﬁdent that we can complete this
transition without serious interruption in our eco-
nomic growth. But we shall not leave this vital
matter to chance. Economic preparedness is full
as important to the Nation as military preparer;
mess?“
The nations of the free world are looking to the
United States for leadership in economic pre-
paredness. This was forcefull brought to my
attention soon after our arriva in Washington.
The subject was discussed by the representatives
of the 55 nations attending the annual meeting
last September of the International Bank for Be-
construction and Development. We learned upon
arrival in Geneva the following week to partici-
pate in the annual session of the General Agree-
ment on Tariffs and Trade—and attended b more
than thirty countries—and immediately fol owing
at the meeting of the Consultative Grou for
South and Southeast Asia, held in New Delhi, that
the question most often asked was: \Vhen is the
United States going to have a depression, and how
serious will it be?
When you realize the extent to which the na-
tions of the free world are dependent upon our
domestic economy, you can better appreciate how
intensely7 interested they are to have us remain
ﬁnancia ly and economically sound.
For this reason the Economic Report of the
President has been scrutinized not only by our own
economists and businessmen but by our foreign
friends as well. The report outlines the Admin-
istration’s accomplishments of its ﬁrst year—the
role of government—the basis for conﬁdence, as
well as measures to be taken to strengthen the econ-
omy. The concluding paragraph in the Presi-
dent’s transmittal letter reads:
"There is much that justiﬁes conﬁdence in the future.
The Government will do its full part to help realize the
promise of that future in its program to encourage an
expanding and dynamic economy."
May I commend the reading of this Economic
Report to all trust oﬁicers, but particularly to those
charged with the responsibility of investment
analysis.

Randell Report Ge“-
With this brief background I would like to
turn to the Report of the Commission on Foreign
Economic Policy which has become known, due to
its dynamic Chairman, as the Randall Report.
It would be easy to dismiss the Randall Com-
mission Report as just another re ort. Despite
the fact the President proposed an the Congress
enacted the resolution creating the Commission,
neither are committed in their approach to the
Commission’s Report. The President and the
Congress are completely free to accept, modify, re-
ject, or i ore the Commission’s recommendations
without inhibition.
In s ite of this complete freedom, it is already
clear t at this is not just another report, but a.
milestone in the development of this Nation’s for-
eign economic policy. Its inﬂuence is already felt
in both the executive branch and in the Congress,
and there is every reason to believe that the in-
ﬂuence will continue to be felt for many years to
come. Nations abroad are scanning its pages
with care and deliberation. They are seeking to
learn the full si niﬁcance of its statements and
implications. T e press throughout the world
is engaged in anal zing its many as ects. Gov-
ernment oﬁicials,a ected interests, an thoughtful
citizens are giving the report exceptional atten-
tion. No, this is not 'ust another re ort. This
may be a taking-off oint for a new p use of our
economic relations With other nations.
In order to appreciate the role the Randall
Commission Report promises to play in the de-
velopment of this country’s foreign economic
policy, let us look for a moment at its background.
The last 20 years have made revolutionary
changes in the economic and olitical position of
the United States in the world). Not only did we
come out of \Vorld \Var II the strongest Nation in
the world, but we were the dominant economic
and ﬁnancial power, the only country with sufﬁ-
cient material strength and capacity to rebuild the
devastated economies of victor and vanquished
states. It was soon apparent that if we wished to
live in a healthy, peaceful world, we could do so
only by helping to restore war-weary states to
economic and political health. Our industrial
output, our agricultural production, our ﬁnancial
capacity, our shipping strength, and the vigor of
our economy overshadowed those of any other
state on this lobe. In that historical moment, the
future healti and well-being of the free world
depended upon our assistance. When it became
clear that economic recovery alone was not enough
for a peaceful and stable world, we had to assume
new burdens involved in bringing help to our
friends by again takin up heavy burdens of
mutual military pre are ness.
The Marshall p an and aid rograms were
phases of our postwar economic re ations. Today
we are the largest purchaser and the largest seller
of goods in the free world, indeed, in the entire
