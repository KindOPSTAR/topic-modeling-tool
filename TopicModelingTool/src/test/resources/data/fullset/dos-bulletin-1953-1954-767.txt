facts that have already shocked the civilized
world.
The members of this Council are familiar with
the ﬁndings of the Ad Hoc Committee and with
the judicial tone in which they are presented.
The restraint, the understatements, the careful
way in which the three eminent members leaned
over backward in reaching their conclusions, attest
both to their own competence and to the conserva-
tism of their ﬁndings.
The three members a plied a basic standard of
justice—the standard t lat an accused is innocent
until proven guilty—even to allegations against
countries that do not accord this right to their own
citizens. They were hampered at every turn by
Iron Curtain refusals to cooperate. The only
comments the Committee had from the Soviet
world were those made during Council debate.
Even taking them into account, the Committee
was forced to conclude that forced labor in its most
reprehensible form was a signiﬁcant art of the
Soviet structure, and that in parrot-1i e fashion,
forced labor occupied a comparable place in the
satellite countries. They found the existence of
forced labor used as a political weapon to throttle
any freedom. What this means is that the ma-
jority of the forced laborers are political prison-
ers rather than ordinary criminals in the free-
world sense. And they found a second form of
forced labor. That second form is com ulsion to
work for the state as the state commant s without
freedom of job choice or movement. By this
means, the Soviet dictatorshi s extract from
human lives concentrated and c ea labor which
could not otherwise be attracted. hat, I submit,
makes men into mere dots on a blueprint, an
anonymous proletariat enslaved by a ruthless
dictatorship.
The personal testimony of the victims who suf-
fered t e enslavement found by the Committee is
only summarized in the Report’s appendixes.
One wishes that it were possible to publish the full
record for all the world to see; yet one can under-
stand the decision of the Committee not to do so.
The Committee’s procedure was criticized by the
representative of the Soviet Union in Commit-
tee III of the Eighth General Assembly as part
of the secretive character of the “slanderous” and
“provocative” attack on the U.S.S.R. I won-
der whether the U.S.S.R. would really like to
see the record of the Committee’s hearings made
public in all its shocking detail. That record
would show not only forced labor, but evidence
on other violations of human rights and decent
standards—the tragic breaking up of homes, the
separation of husbands and wives, of mothers from
their children, the use of brutality, the imposition
of unreasonable and arduous tasks on women and
children, the cruel transition from dreams and
hopes of the future to the nightmare of prison
camp life—in sum, the shattering of countless
human lives.
Experiences of Vlctlms In SovletlfLabor Camps
Let me give you only a partial summary of the
actual experiences of 118 former inmates of the
Soviet Union’s forced labor camps—farm workers,
unskilled laborers, bookkeepers, managers, engi-
neers, journalists.
In most instances the victim was picked up in
the dead of night and taken away from his home,
permitted to brin on] the clothes he wore. He
was subjected to engt y and re eated interroga-
tion, many times accompanied y psychological
coercion or hysical violence.
After their inquisition, the victims usually were
subjected to some kind of rigged “trial,” although
some were sent to forced abor camps without
trial. Some were tried in absentia. There ap-
pears to be no rule as to whether the victim has a
right to defend himself or obtain legal defense;
defense counsel sometimes was provided, some-
times not. Sentences sometimes were pronounced
after trials lasting not more than 15 minutes.
After the trial the victims were trans orted to
forced labor camps, usually in guarded reight or
cattle cars.
“We got 400 grams of salt ﬁsh every two days,
and 300 grams of bread daily,” one former inmate
said. “Sometimes we went two or three days
without water. Usually they ﬁve us one pail for
70 persons to scramble at. oever .was quick
got something to drink, many did not drlnk at all.”
The camps and cells usually consisted of bar-
racks, inﬁrmary, kitchen, and administration
buildings enclosed by barbed or electriﬁed wire
and guarded by watch towers and atrolled by
dogs and armed guards. Many of t 1e camps in-
cluded women prisoners receivmg treatment sub-
stantially the same as that provided for the men.
While usually the women were iven separate
quarters, and penalties were provi ed for contact
between men and women risoners, the stories of
the former inmates revea ed instances of sadism
and depravity which are revolting in the extreme.
More often than not food in the camps was
rationed according to whether the victim fulﬁlls
his work quota.
“Anyone who was unable to meet the quota re-
ceived 400 grams of bread,” one former inmate
reported. “Whoever exceeded the quota got 800
grams.”
The great majority of those who have reported
on forced labor camp conditions say that the
clothing issued was inadequate.
One man had this to say:
Theoretically, we should have been issued full clothing,
but what we got was in a wholly bad condition. Torn,
dirty, and in holes. The shoes were very bad. Prisoners
were not supposed to be sent out barefoot, but in reality
the dogs sometimes tore the clothes. But it was especially
from the hard work that the clothes deteriorated.
Usually the camps had a doctor but frequently
he was himself one of the prisoners and often all
medical care was in the hands of nurses. Usually
