interest. I am conﬁdent that this new program
will appreciably contribute to the achievement of
a sound and prosperous domestic wool industry,
an essential component of a healthy overall econ-
omy and a strong defense.
In view of the fact that the administration’s
new wool program is speciﬁcally designed to help
remedy those conditions which prompted the
Tariff Commission’s investigation, I am taking no
action on the Commission’s Report.
Peaceful Change Through the United Nations
by David McK. Key
Assistant Secretary for United Nations A/faz'rs‘
This afternoon I should like to share with you
a few thoughts on the opportunities that the
United Nations offers for bringing about peaceful
change in the world today.
Change is the law of life—of international life
as well as national. The task of the statesman
is to tr to create conditions in which changes will
take p ace in a peaceful and orderly manner. If
such international changes—political, economic,
and social—cannot be made peacefully, the peace
that may seem to exist may turn out to be only
temporary and illusory.
In a dynamic society in which the atom can
bring either unimagined beneﬁts or awesome de-
struction, the process of peaceful change becomes
more than simply desirable. It becomes an abso-
lute necessity.
Let no one underestimate the difﬁculties of
bringing about changes on the international scene
in a peaceful manner. In our own domestic so-
ciety we have achieved the necessary community
of interest, the common concept of justice, and the
accepted institutions whieh_enable us after 165
years to make adjustments Without resort to phys-
ical violence.
But what of relations among nations? Here
opinions are considerably more diversiﬁed and
com lex, and the area of common a cement rela-
tive y restricted. Standards of justice differ.
That is why adjustments of relations among na-
tions are considerably slower and more difﬁcult to
achieve.
The history of the League of Nations is in part
a history of the failure to reach agreement on the
changes needed to insure peace. Some of the

ington, D. C., on Mar. 1 (press release 100).
major powers insisted on blindly maintaining the
status quo. League procedures did not sufﬁciently
facilitate accommodation to the forces of change.
All this he] ed to develop a situation in various
countries w ere advocates of violence supplanted
the more moderate elements who sought unsuc-
cessfully to achieve their objectives by peaceful
means.
The procedures of the League could have been
made to work if there had been a will and deter-
mination by all its members to make them work.
In addition, after World War I, the American
people, who even then possessed a preponderant
power in the world, were not yet ready to assume
responsibilities for world leadership. We did not
{pain the League of Nations. We thought we could
an oasis o prosperity in a world of misery. We
did not see the fu implication for the rest of the
World of revolutionary communism as directed
from the Kremlin.
Awakened American Leadership
The American people have acted differentlyv
since World lVar II. There is greater recogni-
tion than ever before that peace is not a static
condition of the world, but can be, and must be, a
condition of dynamic adjustment to ever-chang-
ing circumstances.
We now comprehend as never before our re-
sponsibility in the world. iv e have taken leader-
ship in creating the United Nations and we have
since played an active part, in that organization,
as well as in its specialized agencies. lVe have
joined in major collective security arrangements
within the framework of the United Nations
Charter.
