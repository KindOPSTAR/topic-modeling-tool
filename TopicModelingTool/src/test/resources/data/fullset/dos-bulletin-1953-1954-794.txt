The following year a dispute arose between the
Governments of the Dominican Republic on the
one side and Haiti, Cuba, and Guatemala on the
other. Here again rompt action by the Council
of the OAS, under t e Treaty of Rio de J aneiro,
resulted in measures by the various governments
to eliminate causes of serious grievances and re-
store a peaceful climate. In neither case was it
necessary to invoke the enforcement provisions of
the Treaty of Rio de J aneiro.
During the period since \Vorld lVar II, there
have been several instances of sharp controversies
between republics of this hemisphere, sometimes
involving momentary armed conﬂict. Yet all of
these controversies have been held within—0r re-
stored to—the channels of orderly peaceful solu-
tion, and the vast majority of cases have been so
resolved. This happy contrast with events in
other parts of the world is, of course, due to a
number of factors. Not least among them, how-
ever, is the existence of the re ional collective
security system which has been eveloped in the
Americas. This, in turn, has depended for its
success upon 100 years or more of effort on the
part of the American Republics to create an inter-
national system of morality which does not counte-
nance a resort to force, and places respect for law
high among the basic responsibilities of each State.
Aggression by Subversive Means
Finally, let us turn for a few moments to the
problem which may well be u permost in the minds
of most people today when t ey consider the prob-
lem of collective security in the Americas. I refer
to the problem of subversive activities, the method
pursued by international communism in its striv-
ing for domination of independent states.
During World War II the American Republics
had their ﬁrst large-scale experience with subver-
sive activities. German communities in many of
the Latin American countries actively promoted
the Nazi cause, and encouraged a favorable atti-
tude toward national socialism. A widespread
propaganda machine supported these efforts which
were in large measure ﬁnanced by the proﬁts of
local German-owned businesses.
The problem of Nazi-inspired subversive activ-
ity, however, differed from the Communist activ-
ity of today in one very important respect. For
the most part it was carried out by aliens—that
is Germans—even though those aliens might be
residents of an American Republic and deeply
involved in the local business and social com-
munity. The Communist problem, on the other
hand, relates primarily to nationals of American
Republics who have become agents of the interna-
tional Communist movement. Attempts to deal
with the problem created by the activities of these
persons may, therefore, involve the relationships
between a government and its own citizens.
Thus proposals to deal with Communist activ-
ity have run up against the problem of noninter-
vention. Communist a ents display reat ability
at inﬁltrating into all kinds of popu ar national
organizations and causes, making use of them for
their international ends. It is often difﬁcult to
unmask the agents of the international Communist
movement and to distinguish them from enuine
national leaders of social and economic re orm.
This difﬁculty was reﬂected in the debate at the
Caracas conference of the subject entitled “Inter-
vention of International Communism in the
American Re ublics.” The U.S. maintained that
any successfu intervention b_ the international
Communist movement would 1n effect subject an
American State to the political control of a non-
American force. Not only would this conﬂict with
the Monroe Doctrine; it would come well within
the rovisions of the Treaty of Rio de Janeiro
whic calls for consultation in the event the po-
litical independence of an American State is af-
fected by any fact or situation that might endan-
ger the peace of America.
At the same time, the seizure of power in an
American State by the international Communist
movement would constitute the extension to this
hemisphere of an alien political system and thus
violate another major provision of the Monroe
Doctrine.
At Caracas, the Government of Guatemala, not
without reason, felt itself articularly concerned
over this debate, even thoug the situation in that,
or any other country, was not a sub'ect of dis-
cussion. Frequent statements by public and pri-
vate ersons in the U.S. and elsewhere, listing
s eci c examples of important Communist in-
ﬂlﬂence in Guatemala, had one unanswered except
b evasive generalities. e U.S. proposed at
aracas that the Conference agree to a ly the
consultative procedure of the Treaty ofulho de
J aneiro to any case in which an American State
should fall under the domination of the interna-
tional Communist movcment. The tactic of
Guatemala in opposition to this proposal was to
raise the old bogie of Yankee intervention.
Delegates of other countries placed the problem
in its correct context when they pointed out that
the ap lication of the consultative procedure to
the pro lem of Communist subversion was the best
insurance against intervention. The United
States at Caracas osed the problem of what to do
in the event an erican State should be sub-
verted and dominated by the most powerful hostile
force ever to threaten the independence of the
New W'orld. The proposal made by the U.S. was
again, as it had been during the 1930’s, to invite
the other American Republics to share, through
the consultative procedure, in the responsibility
for determining how this problem should be met.
What is the alternative to such a proposal?
History has demonstrated that the normal course
has been for great powers to intervene by force in
