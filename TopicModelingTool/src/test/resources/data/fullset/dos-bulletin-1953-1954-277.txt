United States was recently announced by our able
Secretary of State.
Reviewing the past decade or two, I think it is
agreed that many of the policies followed had been
sound. However, they were in the main emer-
gency measures, taken to meet situations im osed
y forces outside our borders. The “new ook”
at our policies has resulted in policies and pro-
grams t at are geared for the long pull.
In harmony with the times, we are planning for
“an entire historical era.” The United States must
be strong not only for today but for tomorrow,
and for all tomorrows of the foreseeable future.
\Ve must be strong not alone for ourselves but
for those who, today, look to us for leadershj in
building their own strength and maintaining t eir
own security.
American policy recognizes our need for allies
and friends. As in the past, it laces its hope for
ultimate eace in the world in tlie united stren h
and the etermination of the free peoples. T at
strength is being increased and that unity is bein
reinforced. Our policies are shaped to that en .
Admittedly, freedom frequently involves differ-
ences of opinion. It does between people. And it
does between nations. Sometimes these are rather
violent diﬁ'erences. Complete uniformity is not
to be expected from free peoples.
When these differences arise between our friends
and allies the United States hopes, and is planning,
to maintain a position of impartial friendship for
both. By way of illustration, we are not takin
sides in disputes between Israel and the Ara
States, between India and Pakistan, or in any
other situation where differences in the free world
arise. We think—we feel we know—that we can
be of more service to our friends, and to the cause
of peace, if we do remain impartial.
I have spoken of the free world, our friends and
allies in that world.
Current Dlvlslon of World
It is the unspeakable tragedy of our times that
we must recognize a division of the world today.
We refuse to recognize such a division as perma-
nent. We believe that time and the fundamentals
are working for us. Among the fundamentals on
our side are the richness—spiritual, intellectual,
and material—that freedom alone can produce.
It was in this spirit that our Secretary of State
went to the meeting in Berlin of the Four Powers
of the grand alliance of \Vorld War II. If you
have been following the developments of that con-
ference you cannot fail to have been impressed by
the strength that spirit has given us and our allies.
The objective of the Soviets in Berlin is obvious.
It is to weaken the unity of the free world, strik-
ing particularly at the free nations of Europe and
the United States. Soviet efforts, to date, how-
ever, have met a stone wall. The United States,
the United Kingdom, and France are demonstrat-
ing in Berlin their unity is unimpaired.
n Asia the Communist imperialism failed in its
atest gamble to date, the aggression against
orea. ur “new” olicy contalns owerful de-
terrents against other Koreas. Npo would-be
aggressor hereafter can take such a gamble with-
out the gravest risk.
The United States has twice of late mentioned
Indochina as illustratin this transition in policy.
S eciﬁcally we have sai that, if there is open Red
inese aggression in that area, there will be
“grave consequences which might not be conﬁned
to Indochina.” We feel this may provide the best
form of insurance against aggressmn.
Today, living in a world where emergencies in-
evitably develo and must be met, we are deter-
mined to formu ate our olicy lines on along time
basis which we hope in tlie future will avoid resort
.to the im rovisation of billions for foreign eco-
nomic ai and overnight commitments to ﬁght
land battles in Asia or elsewhere. We are aware
of the implacable Soviet plans to weaken us by
overextension in efforts which in the words of
Lenin are beyond our strength so that we may
come to practical bankruptcy. It has become ob-
vious to all of us that the ultimate Soviet hope is
that by their policy of attrition they will gain the
ﬁnal victory over us when the moment comes for
Stalin’s objective of the decisive blow. We know
that it is not sound economics or effective foreign
policy to support permanently other countries or
to become committed to military expenditures so
eat that they will lead inevitably to national
ankru tcy.
Our overnment is seeking a national security
system at a maximum deterrent and at a bearable
cost, and our purpose is to make our relations with
our allies more effective and less costly. We are
placing today more reliance on deterrent power
and less on local defensive power and are deter-
mined now to deter aggression by responding
vigorously at places and with means of our own
choosing. As long as American basic policy con-
cepts were unclear and undecided, it was impos-
sible for our Joint Chiefs of Staff to be selective
in building our military power. That enabled an
enemy thus to choose the time and place and
method of warfare, while we met aggression by
local opposition. In other words, putting out
bonﬁres wherever they happen required us to ﬁght
anywhere whether in Asia, the Near East, or
Europe, with old weapons or with new weapons.
Now the President and the National Security
Council have taken the necessary basic policy deci-
sions and these depend largely upon our great
capacity to retaliate instantly by means and at
places of our own choosing. Thus our defense
establishment can shape our military apparatus to
ﬁt our policy instead of torturing itself in an effort
to be ready to meet any choice of an enemy. That
