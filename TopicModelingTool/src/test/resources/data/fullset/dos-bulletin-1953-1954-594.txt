This relationship has been characterized as that

mark of being a willing, determined, and close
one.
Cooperation Between Mao and Moscow
Althou h Soviet ofﬁcials previous to the
Chinese Communist assumption of power were
protesting that they did not know what “those
independent a rarian reformers” were up to, there
was alread c ose cooperation between Mao and
Moscow. espite the Treaty of Friendship and
Alliance between the Repub ic of China and the
Union of Soviet Socialist Re ublics si ned on
August 14, 1945, which speciﬁe that Sowet “sup-
port and aid . . . be entirely given to the na-
tional government as the central government of
China” the Soviet Union a few months later
turned over to the Chinese Communists the J a -
anese equipment it received in Manchuria. T e
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics instituted
diplomatic relations with Peiping only 2 days
after the regime’s establishment, and ﬁve Eastern
European Soviet satellites followed suit within
the week. The North Korean re ime, the East
German Communist satellite, an the so-called
People’s Republic of Mon olia also established
diplomatic relations with tﬁe new regime during
the ﬁrst month of its existence.
The Sine-Soviet Friendship Association, a mass
organization whose aim, accordin to the Com-
munists, is “to found and consolidate fraternal
friendship and cooperation between the Chinese
and Soﬁet peo le and to develo the interﬂow of
knowledge an ex erience of t e two eat na-
tions” was founde in Peiping on] 4 a s after
the establishment of the so-cal ed “ eople’s
Government.”
The Mao regime has since concluded with the
Soviet Union and other Communist states vari-
ous economic, military and cultural treaties and
agreements. Strong ideological ties bind Moscow
and Pei ing, and a number of Chinese Commu-
nist lea ers are Moscow trained. The Chinese
Communists also feel the need for close associa-
tion with the Soviet Union to develop their mili-
tary strength and striking power. They need
Russian military supplies and equi ment, and
Russian technicians and economic ai for the de
velopment of heavy industry, which they view as
a necessary base for a large militar ' establish-
ment. In exchange, China can furnis the Soviet
Union with needed raw materials and food stuffs,
and offer the use of the warm water ports of
Dairen and Port Arthur. The Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics does not want a strong, inde-
pendent China on its Siberian border. It is nat-
urally interested in the survival and growth of
a Communist China (so long as it does not grow
too strong and independent) and in alliance with
a Communist China it is in a far stronger power
position than it would be otherwise. The close
cooperation and interdependence between the
Chinese Communists and the Soviet Union in the
Korean aggression is well known.
As a. corollary to Communist China’s “leaning”
to the Soviet side, she has unceasingly heaped
vituperation and all manner of abuse and insult
upon the free world in general and the United
States in particular—over the radio, in news-
papers, at the conference table, and in numerous
eriodicals in many languages (even including
speranto), which are sent all over the world.
Aside from the serious policy implications in
this performance, such conduct somehow seems
especial] shocking, coming from the Chinese.
For welly over a century Americans have had a.
deep interest in and sincere friendship for the
Chinese people. Our record in supporting China’s
territorial integrity and political independence is
a well-known one. It is a source of deep concern
and regret to us that for more than 4 cars we
have been cut off from our accustomed c ose asso-
ciation with the great majority of the Chinese
people.
There are some who feel that this unfortunate
situation could be remedied if we were to recog-
nize the Peiping regime and if it were accepted
as re resenting China in the United Nations.
Actuallly, even if we considered such action to be
morally justiﬁable, there is not a shred of evidence
to indicate that we could expect reciprocit on
any satisfactory basis, leading to a renewal 0 our
association with the Chinese on the mainland.
During the few months precedin and following
the establishment of the so-calle People’s Gov-
ernment in Peiping, Chinese Communist authori-
ties jailed or otherwise maltreated a number of
our ofﬁcial representatives, and never recognized
their ofﬁcial status. Final] , when the situation
became intolerable, we with rew all of our ofﬁcial
representatives, requestin the British to repre-
sent our interests. The ritish have tried to do
this to the best of their ability. They are ham-
red in this endeavor, however, for while they
ave reco ized the regime and have di lomatic
and consu ar ofﬁcials on the mainland, t e Com-
munists have not seen ﬁt to establish diplomatic
relations with the British, and have refused to
accord full accreditation to British oﬂicials. The
British, and indeed others with fully accredited
representation in Peiping have in vain attem ted
on our behalf to secure the release of some un-
dred Americans held in Communist China a ainst
their wishes, 32 of whom are in 'ail now, he (1 in-
communicado, without trial, an without even a
statement of the charges held against them.
