famine. Notable examples are the immediate pro-
vision of nurses and serums when epidemics broke
out following the civil disorders on the frontiers
of India and Pakistan in 1947 ; voluntary feeding
in Yugoslavia and India as speciﬁcally author-
ized to supplement the ublic pro ams of relief
made available by the gugoslav mer ency Re-
lief Assistance Act of 1950 and the In ia Emer-
gency Food Aid Act of 1951; the continuin pro-
gram of relief to the homeless following t e in-
vasion of South Korea, including notable hospital
and outpatient services; relief to the victims of
the ﬂood in the Po Valley in 1951; and recently,
aid to the suﬁ'erers from the sea ﬂood in Holland
and the earthquake in Greece. This experience has
led the Food and Agriculture Organization to
consider the part of voluntary agencies in plans
to combat famine and other natural disasters.
Apart from emergency relief programs the ob-
'ective sought by the American voluntary agencies
as been t 1e acceptance of responsibility by in-
digenous agencies for long-term followup social
services. Rehabilitation services to this end have
been diverse but include such major projects as
health—public health education and premedical
training, operation of mobile units and clinics,
subsidies to local doctors, and rehabilitation of
substandard institutions through supplies and
services; welfare—training programs, individual
case work and supervisory service, child place-
ment, and community projects‘ self-help—voca-
tional training, rehabilitation of the disabled, and
agricultural and industrial work projects; and aid
to refugees—location and tracing services, legal
aid, assistance in repatriation, and settlement and
resettlement.
The development of the Government’s Techni-
cal Assistance Program has revealed the oten-
tials of the voluntary agencies in this ﬁel , par-
ticularly in agriculture, small industries, educa-
tion, health, and social services. Contracts pro-
viding grants-in-aid have been made with a few of
the agencies but the greater opportunity appears
to be in the area of private endeavor.
In 1951 the Advisory Committee on Voluntary
Foreign Aid completed and published A Guide
to Technical Assistance Services of United States
Voluntary A genciea Abroad.“ These service proj -
sets, which are mostly sponsored by churches and
missionary societies, are generally active in the
rural areas of Latin America, Africa, and the Near
and the Far East, and number 2,500 in the ﬁelds of
education, health, agriculture, social service, and
industry. A number of agricultural demonstra-
tion centers, industrial schools, clinics, and hospi-
tals are maintained by local and American sup-
port in cooperation.
The role of voluntary agencies in technical as-
sistance has been the subject of an exhaustive
study undertaken in 1951—1952 b a working team
of the American Council of V0 untary Agencies

“ Department of State publication 4422.
for Foreign Service, with the cooperation of rep-
resentatives of private, governmental, and inter-
governmental agencies.“ In its ﬁnal summary the
study recommended that a Committee on Techni-
cal Assistance Cooperation be established within
the framework of the American Council of Vol-
untary Agencies for Foreign Service, as a con-
tinuing representative committee, with participa-
tion by intergovernmental agencies.
The guide and the study supplement in the pri-
vate ﬁeld the compilation of technical assistance
projects published by the former Technical C0-
operation Administration. There remains the
need to compile the technical assistance activities
of American business ﬁrms and corporations, pri-
vate foundations, and educational institutions.
Such complete information of the American non-
governmental operating interests in the underde-
veloped areas should serve as policy guidance for
the appraisal of further endeavors, whether public
or rlvate.
n general the ﬂow of voluntary aid to postwar
Europe receded markedly after the Marshall plan
got under way. The total value of the resources
of $1119] million during the 7 postwar years was
twice as great as during the same number of years
of neutrality and active war. Nevertheless the
dro was steady, year after year, from $230.5
million in 1946 to $87.8 million in 1952. There
was an upturn in the ﬁrst half of 1953 due in part
to renewed allocations of surplus dairy products
from the Department of Agriculture.
The economic recovery, as it progressed, di-
minished the appeals of the nationals in Euro
for help from their American kinsfolk and frien .
In fact only about 10 percent of the voluntary
contributions were for the direct support of racial
groups. This shift in relative needs permitted the
registered agencies to allocate a greater proportion
of their resources to refugee relief, particularly
in Austria, Germany, Greece, and Italy ; to refugee
Poles, Czechs, Yugoslavs, Balts, Chinese, and Rus-
sians, scattered from the British Isles through
continental Europe, the Near East to the Far East,
and Latin America; and to the support of general
rograms, including refugee relief in the Arab
states, Israel, India, Pakistan, Japan, and sub-
stantially in Korea. In these Eastern countries,
with few blood ties of its people in America, the
programs of the agencies were largely made pos-
sible by church constituencies. In fact these con-
stituencies, Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish, pro-
vided about two-thirds, or $710 million, of the re-
sources during the postwar years.
Statutory authority made possible in the post-
war period, for the ﬁrst time, the provision of
material support by our Government to supple-
ment its good oﬁices and to complement its pro-
grams of assistance overseas. Aid was provided
