in insisting that our roposals were the only
valid ones. In this we ave diﬂ'ered most notably
from the USSR, which, while always insisting
that its roposals were the onl ones with any
validity, as refused to ex lain t em or to discuss
their ambiguities. The nited States has one
test for any proposal—the test of effective safe-
guards to fprotect all nations from violations or
evasions 0 an agreed disarmament program and
to give adequate warning of any breach of these
agreements. We have been ready, willing, even
eager, to support any rogram that would reduce
the danger of war and) the fear of aggression, so
long as it really protected the security of all
nations.
President Eisenhower has promised that “this
Government is ready to ask its people to join
with all nations in devoting a substantlal percent-
age of the savings achieved by disarmament to a.
fund for world aid and reconstruction. The pur-
poses of this great work would be to help other
peoples to develop the undeveloped areas of the
world, to stimulate proﬁtable and fair world trade,
to assist all eoples to know the blessings of pro_
ductive free om.” 2
Our delegates in London next week have this
goal before them. It is a goal founded in the con-
cept of brotherhood.
The Role of the International
Red Cross in War and Peace
Statement by Under Secretary Smith a
I very much welcome this opportunit to visit
the headquarters of the League of Red ross So-
cieties and to pay homage to the immortal founder
of the Red Cross Henri Dunant, a Swiss national
and a native of éeneva, on the 126th anniversary
of his birth which is being observed today as Inter-
national Red Cross Day.
Geneva has given much to the world. None of
her contributions to the causes of humanity and
peace has been eater than the Red Cross. To
men of good wil , it will ever stand as an inspira-
tion in their striving for peace and understanding
among nations.
'BULLmN of Apr. 27, 1953, p. 602.
' Made at the headquarters of the League of Red Cross
Societies, Geneva, on May 8 (released to the press by
the U.S. delegation to the Geneva Conference).
Until the last, a heroic nurse trained by the Red
Cross was the only woman at Dien-Bien-Phu to
attend the wounded who could not be evacuated.
She served the recise need envisioned by Henri
Dunant at the Y3attle of Solferino. It was his
idea that men wounded in battle should no longer
be regarded as combatants—that they should re-
ceive care re ardless of the uniform they wore.
It is a pity that this humane principle is not al-
waIys observed, even today.
recall that it was an American, Henry P.
Davison, who in 1919 started the Red Cross inter-
nationally on its peacetime work. He was the
founder of this world Red Cross federation whose
headquarters are in this building. My country-
men, over the years, in cooperation with other
countries, have sought in a concrete and imagina-
tive way to advance its aims of relieving the suf-
fering of victims of disease, poverty, and natural
disasters.
Examples of such efforts come to our attention
repeatedly. In Greece today, thousands of men,
women, and children made homeless by last week’s
earthquakes are receiving Red Cross aid. In the
same way, victims of recent tornadoes in the United
States are bein hel ed. Month after month, in
\Vest Berlin, t e erman Red Cross has been
sheltering and feedin the bulk of the thousands
of refu ees from the ast who arrive with only
the clot es on their backs in their uest for free-
dom. National Red Cross ersonne , by unrelent-
ing, selﬂess, and frequent y heroic efforts over
many years, have been instrumental in the relief
of human suffering, regardless of race, creed, or
political affiliations.
I join with you in the fervent hope that the day
may not be far off when the Red Cross throughout
the world can concentrate its energies on its peace-
time task.
