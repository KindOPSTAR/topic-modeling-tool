assistance and milita aid on a basis comparable
to that given during t e past year,” and the Presi-
dent ho that the Iranian Government would
take suc steps as were in its power “to prevent a
further deterioration” of the dangerous situation
in Iran.u
The situation did, in fact, become worse, and
on July 28 Secretary Dulles indicated that the
growing activities of the illegal Communist
(Tudeh) Party in Iran, and their toleration by
the Government, had caused the United States
“great concern.” These develo ments, he said,
made it “more diﬂicult for the nited States to
grant assistance to Iran.”“ Dramatic events
took place within a few weeks. The eriod of
August 15—22 witnessed the Shah’s decision to dis-
miss Dr. Mossadegh and appoint General
Fazlollah Zahedi as Prime Minister; Mossadegh’s
coup d’etat to counter this move; and the Shah’s
ﬂight and triumphant return on August 22, after
popular demonstrations and action by loyal troops
established Zahedi in power and led to the arrest
and subsequent trial of Mossade h.
Prime Minister Zahedi appea ed to President
Eisenhower for assistance on August 26. After
expressing gratitude for the assistance which the
United States was already extending to his coun-
try, he pointed out that the treasury was empty,
foreign exchange exhausted, and the national
economy deteriorating. General Zahedi declared
the intention of his Government not only to
strengthen Iran internallv but also to improve its
international position. resident Eisenhower on
August 27 felicitated the Shah and expressed
“continuing good wishes” for every success in his
efforts to “promote the prosperity of your peo-
ple and to preserve the independence of Iran.”
In a letter to General Zahedi, the President ad-
vised the Prime Minister of the continued Ameri-
can interest in the independence of Iran and the
welfare of its people, noting that he had author-
ized U. S. Ambassador Loy Henderson to con-
sult with regard to American aid programs in
Iran. On September 1, Ambassador Henderson
informed the Iranian Government that the United
States was prepared to make available $23,400,000
for technical and economic aid during the current
ﬁscal year, and General Zahedi promised that
Iran would “expedite the fulﬁllment of programs
designed to advance the welfare of the people of
Iran.” "
.A few days later, on September 5, President
Eisenhower made available $45 million on an
emergency basis, to be used for immediate eco-
nomic assistance to Iran, in addition to existing
American technical assistance and military pro-

grams in Iran. According to the White House
announcement: 2‘
There is great need for immediate assistance to re-
store a measure of stability and establish a foundation
for greater economic development and improvement in
the living standards for all of the people of Iran. It is
hoped that, with our assistance, there will be an increase
in the internal stability of Iran which will allow the
development of a healthy economy to which an early
eﬂective use of Iran‘s rich resources will contribute.
But it was also evident that Iran’s economy,
which de ended to a large extent on the rehabil-
itation o the oil industry, had to be at in order.
At the request of Secretary Dul es, Herbert
Hoover, J r., who had recently been appointed an
adviser to the Secretary on worldwide petroleum
aﬂ'airs, left for Iran on October 15 to study the
country’s oil problems, in the interest of facil-
itating a solution of the Anglo-Iranian oil
controversy.”
When Secretary Dulles, on October 22, wel-
comed Nazrollah Entezam, who had been once
more designated as the Ambassador of Iran to the
United States, he noted that, under the leader-
ship of the Shah and Premier Zahedi, Iran was "—
recoverlng from the effects of the recent Communist-
abetted disorders and is striving to overcome serious eco-
nomic dislocations which have come about during the past
2 years. The United States. as a means of helping Iran
carry out urgent measures to stabilize her economy, has
extended $45 million in emergency aid, in addition to that
previously granted under the technical-cooperation
program.
These measures constituted concrete evidence of
American concern and friendship for Iran and
of the desire of the United States that “Iran pros-
per as an independent country and a respected
member of the family of free nations.”
Meanwhile, the United Kingdom and Iran
since October had been moving toward resuming
diplomatic relations, and by December 5 the re-
sumption of relations was in process. It was also
indicated that negotiations would soon begin, with
a view to reaching a solution of “the differences
concerning oil which had recently caused the
darkening of relations between them, and thus
restore and strengthen their old friendship.” In
his address to the House of Commons on Decem-
ber 17, Prime Minister Churchill declared that
“old friends” like Iran and the United Kingdom
sometimes had “estrangements,” but that it was
“not right that these should last any longer than
need be.”
The Anglo-Egyptian Controversy
The United States, as in the recent past, was
concerned with issues pertaining to Egypt during
