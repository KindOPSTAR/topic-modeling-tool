The report represents a sizeable cross section of
countries. It reﬂects the attitudes of labor and in-
dustry as well as of governments. Therefore, it
seems clear that we can expect additional gains
in putting the equal pay principle into practice
through official action.
Suggestions ter Future Program
Here in the Commission, through our discus-
sion and exchange of information on activities
in our various countries, we have an opportunity
to promote public education for voluntary accept-
ance of equal pay. We are an important forum
for discussion not only of the rogress being made
in our respective countries, ut of the methods
being used for achieving that rogress.
This brings me to the secon major art of my
statement, which deals with metho s to give
broader effectiveness to the equal ay principle.
I would like to discuss ﬁrst, populliir misconce -
tions of the meaning of equal pay; and second, t e
importance of bui ding up an informed public
opinion in support of the equal pay principle.
POPULAR MISCONCIPTION‘
Some of the comments noted in the Inc progress
report indicate the nature of the educational work
that needs to be done. Although the tone of the
report on the whole is encouraging and construc-
tive, it also shows some underlying misconceptions
about the importance of women to the economy
of their various countries and the value of the
work which women do. For example, in several
of the countries there appears to be a prevailing
belief that men are entitled to higher wage rates
on the ground that men have family responsibil-
ities an women do not.
The experience of the United States has shown
the fallacy of these contentions. Women’s Bu-
reau studies show that most women work through
economic necessity, to support themselves and
others. All but a small percent of married women
workers regularly contribute to family support.
Nor is marital status the only criterion as to
whether a worker has family responsibilities. In
the United States most sin le persons, women as
well as men, have to work or a living. In addi-
tion to their own support, many sin le persons
are also responsible for the support of aged par-
ents or other relatives.
In the United States, women are now almost
one-third of our total labor force: one in every
three workers is a woman. Married women work-
ers outnumber single women workers; over half
of all employed women in the United States today
are married women living with their husbands.
The presence of large numbers of women in the
labor force carries with it the otential threat of
competition between men an women on wage
rates. This aspect of equal pay is overlooked in
the government comments reported by the ILo. If
women can be hired at lower rates than men, they
constitute a threat to men’s wages and to the main-
tenance of sound labor standards generally. On
the other hand, utting equal pay into practice
gives workers of both sexes greater wage and job
security. It discourages hiring women for less
money or replacing men by women hired at lower
rates. It protects fair employers from unfair
competition by those who attempt to use women
to undercut men’s wages.
Even where men are not actual]
women workers, the threat of suc replacement
may be used to force wage cuts. The existence
of a pool of labor available for employment at
cheaper rates can always be used to t e disadvan-
ta e of workers on the job.
rotection of wage and job securit is one of
the advantages of equal pay. Anot er is that
equal pay gives workers more money to spend.
In our system of free enterprise, it is im ortant
to keep consumer purchasing power at a hig level.
In plain language, this means that if people have
the money to buy goods, then factories will have
the money to keep producing oods and to pay
wages; and eople, in turn, Wll have money to
buy goods. his is sound economics; it has he ped
us to achieve and maintain a high standard of liv-
ing in the United States.

"BOATING ruauc OPINION
The 110 report indicates the need to create a
favorable climate of ublic opinion as a basis for
applying the rincip e of equal pay. The mem-
bers of this ommission and of the nongovern-
mental organizations can help to do this in our
own spheres of work through the process of
education.
Considerable confusion still exists as to what
equal pay really means. Some pe0ple think of it
in terms of the total paycheck; that is, if a man
and a woman are doing similar work, the week’s
earnings should be the same. Actually equal pay
refers to rates of pay. If one person works longer
hours or produces a larger quantity, he or she
will earn a larger amount although the rates are
the same.
We need to keep emphasizing the fundamental
rinciple that the worker should receive the rate
or the job irrespective of sex. In other words,
the rate of pay should be set for the job itself,
without distinction as to whether a man or a wom-
an is to receive it. Jobs that are designated as
men’s jobs or women’s jobs raise questions as to
whether the rate is based on the worker’s sex
rather than on job requirements.
The agencies best ﬁtted to carry out the educa-
tional activities needed are the nongovernmental
organizations, the women’s organizations and the
unions that are associated with the work of this
Commission. In the United States, one of these
