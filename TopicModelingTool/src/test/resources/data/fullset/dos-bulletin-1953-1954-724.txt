belief that an independent India is a source of
strength to the free world.
Let me say that my views on next year’s aid
ro am for India were not arrived at lightly; in-
see , I have considered this question seriousl
and continuously over a period of 12 months. I
have come to the conclusion that it is wise to con-
tinue a substantial program and that the results of
such action will be beneﬁcial to both India and
ourselves.
Termination of Pakistan
Wheat Program
Prime Minister Mohammed Ali of Pakistan
announced at Karachi on A r11 27 that the special
U.S. wheat program had ac ieved its purpose and
could be terminated. Shipments 0 nearly 23
million bushels (610,976 tons) successfully averted
critical famine conditions that had beset his coun-
try, Prime Minister Ali said.
On the same date, the Director of Foreign Oper-
ations, Harold E. Stassen, issued the followmg
statement:
The Pakistan wheat program which has come to suc-
cessful fruition stands as a worthy example of the high
purposes of United States foreign policies. It has helped
save from starvation millions of human beings. It has
been gratefully received and efﬁciently adminitered and
distributed. It has helped a friendly nation avert a
national disaster by providing food which was in abun-
dant supply in the United States. Through this program,
we have contributed to economic stability in Pakistan and
strengthened conﬁdence and morale.
The people of Pakistan are to be congratulated on the
careful manner in which they carried out the handling
and distribution of this wheat.
Crop failures caused b severe droughts in 1951
and 1952 confronted mil ions of Pakistan’s popu-
lation with the threat of famine in 1953. On
April 22 Pakistan asked for emerglency aid from
the United States and President isenhower re-
quested the Congress to ive him authority to
make available up to 1 miﬁion tons of wheat out
of Commodity Credit Corporation stocks.‘
The Congress sped through legislation and on
June 25 President Eisenhower signed the bill.2
The next day, the ﬁrst shipment of wheat left
Baltimore for Karachi.a It arrived July 21.
The Pakistan WVheat Aid Act provided for ship-
ment of 700,000 tons (about 26 million bushels)
of wheat to Pakistan on a grant basis. An addi-
tional 300,000 tons could be made available under
the legislation on a grant, loan, or purchase basis,

depending on the situation. Neither the balance
of approximately 87,000 tons nor the 300,000 ton
reserve will be needed, it now develops.
At one time, as many as 28 vessels were on the
high seas carrying wheat to Pakistan. The 94th
and last shi ment, consisting of 2,470 tons, is now
enroute and) is due to arrive in Chittagong about
May 22.
The Pakistani Finance Minister has announced
that some 30 percent of the wheat received was
distributed free to the most needy. The balance
reached the market through the normal channels
of distribution. Because the food grain was
readily available to the consumer, the price de-
clined sufﬁciently to produce a stabilizing effect on
other basic foods.
The Pakistani Ambassador to the United States
has said that “several million” of his people have
been saved from starvation by the pro am.
From the sale of the wheat, the Pa istan Gov-
ernment expects to realize about $50 million in
rupees which is earmarked to support projects
agreed upon by the United States and Pakistan
Governments as necessai to the development of
the country, with emphas1s on projects designed to
provide against a recurrence of this last famine
threat.
Wheat was shipped from the United States in
bulk and was bagged in the hold of the ship upon
its arrival in Karachi by Pakistani workmen who
labored around the clock. The sacks of wheat were
distributed via sealed railroad cars, trucks, and
even by camel to the remote villages.
About 67 percent of the wheat shi ped was hard
winter wheat, which is used in ma (ing cliappati.
The remainder was soft wheat. Of the ships that
carried wheat to Pakistan, 56.9 percent were of
U. S. registry. The shipments originated from
the following areas of the United States: 33 per-
cent from the Atlantic coast, 59 percent from the
gulf ports, and 8 percent from the Paciﬁc North-
west.
PAKISTAN OFFERS TOKEN OF GRATITUDE
