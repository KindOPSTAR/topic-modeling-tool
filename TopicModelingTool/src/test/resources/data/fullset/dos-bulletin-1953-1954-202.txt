American Policy in the Middle East During 1953
by Richard H. Sanger ‘
The year since your last convention has been an
eventful one, not on] in the Near and Middle East,
but in the history 0 United States relations with
that part of the world. Let me review for you a
few of the more si 'ﬁcant developments of the
period, which highTi-glht our policy toward that
area.
On March 2 President Eisenhower told Prince
Faisal, Forei Minister of Saudi Arabia and
chairman of tli’iilt nation’s delegation to the United
Nations that he was determined to restore the
spirit of conﬁdence and trust which had previousl
existed between the United States and the Ara
nations. A statement issued by the White House,
following Prince Faisal’s visit, noted that Presi-
dent Eisenhower had expressed concern that there
had lately occurred a deterioration in relations be-
tween the Arab nations and the United States.
He stated that it would be his ﬁrm purpose to seek to
restore the spirit of conﬁdence and trust which had pre-
viously characterized these relations and he hoped that
the Arab leaders would be inspired by the same purpose.
The President alluded to the many strong educational
and cultural ties which had developed between the Arab
world and the United States over a period of many
decades and stated that he was confident that this pro-
vided a foundation of good will on which to build during
the coming years to mutual advantage.
Secretary Dulles' Trip
On March 9, Secretary of States Dulles an-
nounced that he would visit the Near East and
South Asia in May on a fact-ﬁnding trip on which
he would “listen carefully” to what he was told
and consider “with utmost sym athy” any prob-
lems presented to him. Mr. Uhlles went on to
say,
President Eisenhower is keenly aware of the importance
of the Near East and South Asia. The peoples of that part
of the world have a rich culture on which we of the
United States have largely drawn. The President has,
‘Address made before the annual conference of the
American Friends of the Middle East at New York City on
Jan. 29. Mr. Sanger is public-affairs adviser. Bureau of
Near Eastern, South Asian and African Affairs.
therefore, asked me to go personally to the Near East
and South Asia to show our friendship for the govern-
ments and peoples of these areas.
On May 9, Secretary Dulles, Foreign Aid Di-
rector Harold Stassen, and Ass1stant Secrets of
State Henry A. Byroade left b plane on an is-
toric trip which took them to pt, Israel, Jor-
dan, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Saudziy Arabia, India,
Pakistan, Turkey, Greece, and Libya. Mr. Dulles
was the ﬁrst United States Secretary of State ever
to carry out such a. tri .
On returning to “flashington on May 29, Mr.
Dulles said:
We of the State Department will be better qualiﬁed to
advise President Eisenhower in relation to foreign policy.
and Mr. Stassen, Director of Mutual Security. will be
better able to help that program implement our foreign
policy. Above all, we laid a new foundation for friendship.
In a series of meetings with members of Con-
gress, Mr. Dulles moved uickly to build further
understanding of the rob ems of the Middle East.
Then in a speech to t e American people on June
1, which was nationally broadcast by radio and
television, Secretary Dulles said:
It is high time that the United States Government paid
more attention to the Near East and South Asia. . . .
Surely we cannot ignore the fate of the peoples who have
first perceived and then passed on to us the great spiritual
truths from which our own society derives its inner
strength. . . . the primary purpose of our trip was to
show friendliness and to develop understanding. These
peoples we visited are proud peoples who have a great
tradition and. I believe, a great future. We in the United
States are better off if we respect and honor them, and
learn the thoughts and aspirations which move them. It
profits nothing merely to be critical of others. President
Eisenhower's administration plans to make friendship—
not faulttindlng—the basis of its foreign policy.
On his trip the Secretary had arrived at a num-
ber of conclusions, and he noted, in the ﬁrst in-
stance, that most of the peoples of this area were
“deeply concerned about olitical independence
for themselves and others’ and were suspicious
“of the colonial wers”—a.nd of the United States
because, it wast ought, membership of the United
States in N ATO required it “to preserve or restore
