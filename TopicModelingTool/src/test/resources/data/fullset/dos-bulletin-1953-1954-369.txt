Several temporarily organized collections of
funds and gifts-in-kind were undertaken in 1947—
1948: notably the American Overseas Aid—United
Nations Appeal for Children, sponsored by some
40 voluntary a ncies; the Friendship Train for
France and Ita y, supported by the American vol-
untary agencies operating in those countries; and
the Friendship Train for Germany, sponsored by
Caanoo and su ported by donations of wheat,
clothing, and otlier gifts-in-kind from farm com-
munities of the Northwestern States. Throu h
the facilities of the U.S. High Commission or
Germany and the Army, paintings were loaned
to the National Gallery of Art and exhibited in a
number of cities. The proceeds of a silver collec-
tion were administered by Cnanoo for the relief
of German children. In 1951 and a in in 1953
special periods were proclaimed by t e President
in support of voluntary collections for civilian war
victims in Korea, in response to joint resolutions
of Congress Proclamation 2943 of August 31,
1951,12 set aside the month of September for the
collection of clothes through American Relief for
Korea and associated agencies; Proclamation 3018
of June 6, 1953,“ set aside Aid for Korea Week,

port of the American Korean Foundation.

the Heifer Project Committee, American Relief
for Korea (ARK), and the American Korean
Foundation, which operate at home, should be
noted as additional active coordinating and sup-
porting bodies. Cnor has collected from farmers
thousands of freight carloads of agricultural
products which have been allocated to the operat-
ing agencies in the ﬁeld. The Heifer Project
Committee has shipped thousands of head of
livestock to many countries, including bulls, milch
cows, heifers, goats, swine, and chicks, as well
as hatching eggs, to improve roduction. These
organizations have proved to e singularly effec-
tive in supplementing as they do with gifts-in-
kind the money donations of the urban areas. The
American Korean Foundation was not organized
for ﬁeld operations until late in the spring of
1953. It plans to meet rehabilitation needs of
the Korean war victims, particularl in the ﬁelds
of health and education, largely t rough allot-
ments in support of existing facilities and agen-
cies, and in cooperation with the Government of
Korea.
American Relief for Korea collects clothing
primarily. As a measure in furtherance of the
war effort in Korea, the costs to ARK of collec-
tion, processing, warehousing, and freight to sea-
ports have been met by the United Defense Fund
through allocations from the Communit Chests.

the pattern of the National War Fund, to meet
the expanding needs of the Armed Forces through
USO and to assist communities affected by in-
dustrial ex ansion for military pur oses. The
Army carrled the ARK clothing wit out charge
from seaports to Korea for neral distribution to
civilian war victims throug the facilities of the
United Nations Command and the Government of
Korea. The cooperation of the United Defense
Fund and of the Army has made it possible for
ARK to solicit successfully gifts of clothing, with-
out appeal at the same time for funds to meet the
heavy costs of collection, processing, shipping, and
delivery.
It is signiﬁcant that the most productive ﬁeld
operations have been in countries where the agen-
cles without impairing their independence have
formed alliances to meet common problems. In
these countries they have maintained liaison with
the diplomatic, military', and economic missions of
our Government and With the participating gov-
ernments and the indigenous social welfare agen-
cies. Canon in Germany, LARA in Ja an, and
KAVA in Korea are notable examples. In ermany
and J a an the initial relief work of these volun-
tary fe erations has been successfully terminated;
in Germany this has rmitted American relief
resources to be directe to the aid of refugees; in
Japan the way was paved for the introduction of a
national school lunch program; in Korea the task
ahead is a matter of years of concerted effort. The
Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee, in the previously quoted report on volun-
tary aid overseas, said that it “was encouraged by
the record made by the American volunta agen-
cies in establishing teamwork rather than ldiastruc-
tive competition in their efforts.”
In the postwar period public relief pro ams
have provided primary foods, such as the read
grains, to deﬁcit areas through rationing or other-
wise. This is a task that on y governments could
ﬁnance or undertake. Voluntary help through the
provision of the rotective foods—the dairy prod-
ucts and fats of i h nutritional value—as well as
medicines and clot ing, reached selective and vul-
nerable groups such as children, mothers, invalids,

experience has shown, were best reached by vol-
untary agencies collaborating with their indige-
nous counterparts through schools, hospitals, or-
phanages, and other institutions. Importantly
save in the case of disaster the programs were of
not less than 3 months’ duration to ermit the re-
cordin of physical improvement. en supplies
in su cient amounts were assured, such as the
surplus dairy products made available by the De-
partment of A iculture, the programs were gen-
erally projecte over the school year.
American voluntary agencies have been quick
to mobilize their relief services and resources to
meet emergencies arising in theaters of war, from
civil disorder, natural disasters, epidemics, or
