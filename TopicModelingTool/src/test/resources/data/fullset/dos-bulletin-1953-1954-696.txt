through a corporate entity of the foreign country,
as might be appropriate under local conditions.
When the operation is conducted through a for-
eign corporation, it is roposed in certain circum-
stances to permit the .S. c0 oration to hold as
little as 10 percent of the stoc of the operating
company and still obtain these tax beneﬁts.
Another proposal of the President would recog-
nize, for tax credit purposes, the tax regimes of
countries which rely on taxes other than income
taxes as the principal Source of revenue from a
particular businem activity. This would reduce
the burden of the U.S. tax even further below the
level I mentioned earlier.
We believe that, unilaterally, the United States
is taking all steps it reasonably could throu h tax
incentives to induce its capital to seek out ets in
countries in which conditions are such as to offer
attractive and proﬁtable uses for foreign ca ital.
Bilaterally, there are further steps the nited
States is prepared to take. I refer to tax treaties
for the alleviation of double taxation. These
treaties are an integral part of the United States
program to create a favorable tax climate for
international trade and business. As of today,
the United States is a party with foreign countries
to 15 treaties relating to income taxes 10 treaties
relating to estate taxes and death duties, and one
treaty relating to the taxation of gifts. Income
and estate tax treaties with three other countries
are now in the closing stages of negotiations.
What I have said of the policies and program
of the U.S. Government is not intended to be self-
laudatorv or inclusive but to indicate the reasons
why we feel that the United States has gone a long
distance in pursuing measures designed to en-
courage the international ﬂow of private capital.
For my part, I should like to hear more from the
representatives of the capital importing countries
With respect to the measures they have taken in
their common eﬁort. How far have they gone in
examining their domestic laws and admmistra-
tive practices with a view to removing deterrents
to the ﬂow of private capital? Have they gone
as far as the might in providing adequate assur-
ance throug treaties or otherwise with respect
to the treatment of foreign investors? Have they
developed adequate information services and
other means for informin potential investors of
business opportunities an of the relevant laws
and regulations governing forei enterprise?
Have they enlisted participation 0 their own pri-
vate business interests in such activities?
The U.S. Government feels that there is con-
siderable room for further action by individual
governments along these lines. We stand ready
to advise and assist the governments of capital im-
porting countries where appropriate, but we can-
not provide the will to take the necessary measures
where it is lacking.
I come now to what the United Nations can do
to encourage private investment.
First, the United Nations can continue the kind
of work it has done in the two interesting and
valuable reports prepared by the Secreta {ileu-
eral pursuant to a previous Assembly reso ution.
These are most useful and they ought to be
brought u to date from time to time, perhaps on
an annual sis. We should welcome periodic re-
ports providing information on the ﬂow of private
capita and the progress made in the adoption of
measures to stimulate that ﬂow.
Secondly, there is an important area of technical
advice and assistance which ought to be given
greater emphasis in the technical assistance actiVI-
ties of the United Nations and its specialized
agencies.
The United States suggests that member gov-
ernments give more conSi eration to including in
their requests for technical assistance the follow-
ing kinds of services:
(a) Assistance in economic surveys of member
countries to determine the sectors most likel to be
of interest to private investors, and to i entify
speciﬁc 0 portunities within those sectors.
(b) Agvice on the preparation of material re-
garding speciﬁc projects in a manner which Will
command the attention of private investors.
(0) Advice in the revision of legislation and ad-
ministrative practices affecting foreign invest-
ment.
(0?) Advice in establishing channels for the
presentation of speciﬁc projects to potential in-
vestors in capital-exporting countries.
Finally, Mr. President, the United Nations can
aﬂirm the im ortance of international private in-
vestment an can recommend measures to stimu-
late its ﬂow. To this end, the United States will
join with other countries in introducing a resolu-
tion embodying these recommendations. The
ado tion of this resolution ‘ will further the ob-
jective to which most of us attach such great
importance.
