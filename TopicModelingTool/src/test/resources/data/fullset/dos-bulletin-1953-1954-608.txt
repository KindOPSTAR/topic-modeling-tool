U.S.-Canadlan Arrangements
for Continental Alr Defense
Statement b Charles E. Wilson
Secretary 0 Defense ‘
Because of the possibility of aggressive air at-
tacks against North Amerlca, the Canadian and
United States Governments after the Second
lVorld War continued the cooperative arrange-
ments for the defense of North America which had
been brou ht into effect duri the war. Since
that time, t ere have been established in both coun-
tries fully manned radar screens for the detection
of a potential enemy, and installations for inter-
ceptor aircraft and antiaircraft weapons. At all
stages, planning has been carried on between the
two countries on a joint basis and consultations
and cooperation at all levels have been constant
and completely satisfactory.
For some time now, the Canadian and United
States Governments have been appraising the air
defense system to deﬁne the steps required to
strengthen our defenses in the li ht of recent ad-
vances in the destructive capabilities of atomic
weapons against targets in our two countries.
For the past 4 years, work has been going on at
high priority on the construction of a large and
costly radar chain which is required not on] to
detect enemy bombers but also to control ﬁg ter
aircraft engaged in the task of interception. This
radar chain 15 known as the Pinetree Chain.
Long before the Pinetree pro'ect was approach-
ing completion, the military planners of the two
countries were engaged in an intensive study of
what further ste might be desirable and prac-
ticable. In Octo r 1953, a team of military and
scientiﬁc advisers representing both countries rec-
ommended that additional early warning should
be provided by the establishment of a further radar
system generally to the north of the settled terri-
tory in Canada. The report of this team was con-
sidered by the Chiefs of Staff of each country later
that same month. At a meeting in Washington in
November 1953, the Canadian representatives in-
formed the United States authorities that the
Canadian Government was prepared to proceed
