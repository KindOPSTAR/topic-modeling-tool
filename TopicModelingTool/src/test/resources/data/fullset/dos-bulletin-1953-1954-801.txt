imports of scissors and shears. The data fur-
nished by the industry to the Tariff Commission
aﬁ'ord insufﬁcient information, either as to the
precise character of the scissors and shears con-
stituting the bulk of the imports, or as to the focus
of the alleged injurious competition between the
forei and domestic products. There is also a
guestion as to the adequacy of the data on the
nancial experience of American producing ﬁrms
presented in support of their claim of serious in-
]ury from imports.
It is questionable whether such audited ﬁnan-
cial statements requested by the Tariff Commission
as were ﬁnally submitted, by ﬁrms accounting for
little over one-third of the domestic roduction,
constitute a “representative sample.” ;The major-
ity of the ﬁrms, including some of the most im-
portant members, ap arently did not supply such
data, and the full nancial statements for the
eight ﬁrms which did furnish them showed a
higher “net worth” during the latest year than
for any preceding period.
This report does indicate that the last few years
have seen a substantial increase in imports of
scissors and shears, and that the shipments from
domestic plants have not been maintained at the
exce tionally high level of 1948—1950. In view of
the arge war-deferred backlog of demand during
these years and the fact that the usual European
sources of supplies had not yet been fully restored
during that period, a useful basis of comparison
is with the years immediately before the war. So
viewed, it appears that the value of the domestic
shipments of scissors and shears has been running
at about three times that of pre-war, with the early
months of 1953 showin some recovery over the
previous slackening. T e volume of imports has
eveled off since the high point in 1952, with the
rate of importations during 1953 and early 1954
somewhat below that of 1952.
My inquiries with respect to the affected com-
panies indicate that they are not in a depressed
condition, nor are the employees in the industry
producing scissors, shears and related products
suffering—or about to suffer—an reduction in
wage rates, earnings or opportunities for employ-
ment.
The Commission, consistent with the terms of
the law, made its decision on the basis of a threat
of serious injury, rather than present injury re-
sulting from a trade agreement concession. When
this provision of the law is invoked, I believe that
the evidence brought forth to substantiate the
judgment of threat must be of such a character as
to leave no doubt that actual injury is imminent.
In the present instance, I am not persuaded that
the evidence is of such a character.
In view of the above consideration, therefore,
I am not authorizing an increase in the existing
import duties on scissors and shears.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Congressional Consideration of
Economic Policy Proposals
White House press release dated May 20
The White House on May 20 made public the
following exchange of correspondence between the
President and Charles H. Percy, President of the
Bell (ﬁ Howell Company, Chicago, Ill..'
President Eisenhower to Mr. Percy
DEAR MR. PERCY: It is gratifying to have your
letter of May fourteenth expressing strong support
for the foreign economic policy proposals con-
tained in my Message to the Congress of March
thirtieth.1 In that Message I set forth what I
believe to be a minimum essential program for
the building of a stronger America as an integral
part of a strong and economically vigorous free
world. Because I consider the enactment of that
program indispensable to the work that this Ad-
ministration must do in the national interest, I
have given much thought to the means by which
such enactment can best be assured.
As you know, several recommendations in my
Message on foreign economic policy can be car-
ried out without further legislative authority.
Among these are clariﬁcation of the application
of the Buy American legislation, assistance
through the International Monetary Fund and
the Federal Reserve System to nations which un-
dertake convertibility of their currencies, rene-
gotiation of the organizational provisions of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for sub—
mission to the Congress, encouragement to over-
seas investment through giving full diplomatic
support to United States investors abroad and
through actions to encourage more extensive travel.
Accomplishing enactment of the heart of the
program—extension of and amendment of the
Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951, as
amended—would, I believe, best be served by care-
ful and deliberate action taken on the basis of ex-
tensive and unhurried hearings. In this way the
wide public support for the program that I know
exists and to which you attest, will have adequate
time and opportunity to express itself. More-
over, those who are opposed would have full op-
portunity to be heard. It is my hope and expecta-
tion that the Committee on Ways and Means, fol-
lowing the pattern of its historic work last year
on the tax bill, will initiate consideration of the
trade agreements aspect of the program in ample
time so that full and adequate hearings may be
completed between now and the convening of the
Congress next January. Under this procedure the
prospect for consideration by the Congress early
next year is excellent.
