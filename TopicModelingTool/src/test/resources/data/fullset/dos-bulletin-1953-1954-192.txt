of the territorial sovereign. As examples, he cited
the immunity of ambassadors, foreign sovereigns,
and foreign troops permitted to pass through the
territor . By aiialo y to these “implied waiv-
ers,” w ich he rest upon the principle of the
consent of the sovereign, he concluded that for-
eign war vessels were exempt. The status of for-
eign troops was not the issue of the case, and the
Chief Justice’s statement regarding their immu-
nit was by we of example only.
at Marshall’s assing dictum was adopted
verbatim and set orth as law by the ﬁrst sys-
tematic American writer on international law
Henry Wheaten. It was copied and enlarged
upon by other writers of the time. Since then, no
discussion of this subject is complete without a
reference to The Schooner Exchange.
Despite one’s res ect for Marshall dicta, deci-
sions are more aut oritative than dicta, and the
practice of nations has more weight than the opin-
ions of writers. As the Permanent Court of
International Justice said in the case of the S. S.
Lotus, “. . . the words‘ rinciples of international
law,’ as ordinarily used: can only mean interna-
tional law as it is applied between all nations
belonging to the community of states.”
An examination of the actual ractice showed
that the existence of the immunit as been limited
to acts in the course of duty y the courts of
Greece, Panama, and Brazil. Immunity in regard
to acts outside the course of duty has been denied
b the courts of Australia, England, Canada, and
rance, and the Mixed Courts of Egypt. No de-
cision recognized the existence of the alleged im-
munit . Denied by many, and afﬁrmed by none,
the al eged immunity obviously cannot be a prin-
ciple of international law, and the Attorney Gen-
eral's paper on the sub'ect entitled “International
Law and the Status of orces Agreement” so con-
cluded. That aper, incidentally, has been re-
rinted in the cember issue of the Columbia
aw Review (53 Col. L. R. 1091).
After careful debate, the Senate gave its consent
to the ratiﬁcation of the treaty by a vote of 7 2—15,
and another principle of international law, long
the subject of dispute, was well on its way to
general recognition. In such ways, over the
years international law has been developed and
determined.
In the ﬁeld of public international law, some of
the development takes place in bilateral negotia-
tions and some in re 'onal organizations such as
NA'no and the Organization of American States.
I have already outlined some of these develop-
ments. However, the major effort at codiﬁcation
and pro essive development today is in the
United hations.
INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE
As you know, the principal judicial organ of the
United Nations is the International Court of J us-
tice at. The Hague, which is the successor to the
Permanent Court of International Justice, which
existed for many years before the UN. was
founded. In the past few years the Court has de-
cided several important cases, including the
Anglo~Norwegian Fisheries case, the Franco-
American case dealing with rights of American
citizens in Morocco, and some aspects of the
Anglo-Iranian oil dispute.
At present, the United States is interested in
two matters pending before the Court. The ﬁrst
concerns the disposition of a quantity of gold
bullion which was taken from Albania by the
Italians, then from Italy by the Germans, and
ﬁnally from Germany by the victorious allies of
World War II. Great Britain and Italy currently
are contendin for this gold, with the United
States a nominal party. The Italian claim is
based upon Albanian postwar conﬁscation of Ital-
ian property, but Britain asserts a superior claim
because of a judgment which it secured against
Albania in the International Court of Justice in
the Corfu Channel Case, which ou will recall
arose out of damn e to a Britis destroyer by
Albanian mines in t e Corfu Channel.
The second matter is the request by the General
Assembly of the United Nations for an advisory
opinion on certain uestions concernin the pay-
ment of awards to nited Nations em oyees dis-
missed b the Secreta -General. YIdu will re-
member t at some mont s ago the Secreta -Gen-
eral dismissed certain employees who are 'nited
States citizens because they refused, on grounds of
possible self incrimination, to answer uestions
posed by a congressional committee regar ing any
past or present Communist afﬁliations or subver-
sive activities. The United Nations Administra-
tive Tribunal awarded compensation to the
employees in the amount of $170,000 for these dis-
char es. The Court’s opinion is asked as to
whet er the United Nations General Assembly
has the right to refuse to give effect to these
awards.
INTERNATIONAL LII OOIIMIOI
The United Nations bod charged with the codi-
ﬁcation and progressive evelo ment of interna-
tional law is the International w Commission,
a subordinate organ of the General Assembly.
The Commission, which meets for several months
annually, is com sed of 15 eminent international
lawyers and jurists.
Its conclusions and recommendations are re-
ported annually to the General Assembl for con-
sideration. At the session of the Assem ly which
terminated its work in December, three major
projects of the Commission were discussed in the
Assembl ’s Legal Committee.
One 0 these projects is a comprehensive set of
articles on arbitral procedure. The object of the
articles would be to provide a uniform code of
arbitration and to eliminate, so far as possible, the
