African Issues Before the Trusteeship Council’s Thirteenth Session
by Benjamin Gerig
Conditions in the six trust territories in Middle
Africa, namely, Tanganyika, Ruanda-Urundi,
French Cameroons, British Cameroons, French
Togoland, and British Togoland, were considered
by the Trusteeshi Council at its thirteenth session
held at New Yor from J anuar 28 to March 25,
1954. The Council was presi ed over by Am-
bassador Leslie Knox Munro of New Zealand.1
To appreciate the role which the Trusteeship
Council plays in dealing with this aspect of the
colonial question, it is necessary to have in mind
two basic considerations. The ﬁrst is that, unlike
colonies, the trust territories do not belong to the
country that governs them; the second is that the
degree of supervision that can legally be exercised
by the United Nations is much greater in the case
of trust territories than in that of colonies, for
which no supervisory function was provided in the
charter.
It is also important to remember that, although
the trusteeship system includes only 11 out of some
70 existing non-self-governing territories (and
these 11 are all territories taken away from de-
feated enemies in the two World \Vars) , the stand-
ards laid down by the charter, and their applica-
tion as discussed by the Council, can have an
important inﬂuence on colonial policy and admin-
istration generally. Thus, the trusteeshi system
may be regarded as a kind of politica science
laboratory for developing the best methods of pro-
moting the political, economic, and social advance-
ment of de endent peoples, or perhaps as a forum
in which t e best knowledge and experience are
sought on the problem of assisting such people to
become, in the words of the charter, self-governing
or independent.
Actually, the system in ractice has fallen con-
siderably short of earlier opes and expectations.
‘ Other representatives were S. S. Liu (China), Miguel
Urquia (El Salvador), Max Dorsinville (Haiti), Krishna
Menon (India), Rafik Asha (Syria), Semyon K. Tsarapkin
(U.S.S.R.), representing nonadmlnisterinz members; and
William D. Forsyth (Australia), Pierre Ryckmans (Bel-
gium), Leon Pignon (France). John Scott (New Zealand).
Sir Alan Burns (United Kingdom), and Mason Sears
(United States) representing administering members.
For texts of statements made by Mr. Sears during
the session, see BULLETIN of Feb. 22. 1954, p. 298; Mar. 1,
1954, p. 336; and Mar. 22, 1954, p. 453.
Too often, unfortunately, the laboratory method,
where each contributes in a scientiﬁc spirit to
seek the best solution of a problem, tends to 've.
way to what may be called the courtroom met 0d,
where the admlnistering1 member appears to be
treated as a prisoner in t e dock against whom an
indictment must be secured. The latter method
was more noticeable-at the Council’s thirteenth
session than at some previous sessions. Wisely.
the framers of the charter provided for an equal
balance between administering and nonadminister-
ing members; consequently, the Council is in-
clined by its very nature to be a body of mutual
accommodation, com romise, and moderation.
B the same token t e resolutions it is able to
adbpt often do not satisfy the more extreme non-
administering members. In recent years certain
of these members have become increasingly un-
willing to leave primary responsibilit for trus-
teeship matters in the hands of the ouncil and
have sought to emphasize the General Assembly
as the supervisory body, since in the latter they are
more likely to secure the requisite majority for
their roposals—a tactic which tends to nullify
the ba anced principle of the Council. However.
this is a matter for consideration in connection
with charter review rather than for elaboration in
this article.
Members of the United Nations have under-
taken in the charter to promote the advancement
of the people of the trust territories toward self-
government or independence. The six trust
powers, which include the principal colonial
powers, freely accept self-government or inde'
pendence as the goal. The differences arise as to
the speed with which this goal should be attained.
And here the 12 members of the Council, as well
as the 60 members of the United Nations, fall
into two groups. One group argues for early.
if not immediate, liquidation of the whole colo-
nial system. They consequently seem to show less
interest in improving the system or in helping to
develop schools, roads, hospitals, etc, than in
emphasizing the establishment of native self-
governing institutions. Self-government, they
sav. is always better than good government.
