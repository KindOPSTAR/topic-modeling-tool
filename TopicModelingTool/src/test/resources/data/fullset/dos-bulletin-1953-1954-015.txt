The Danger Spots
Well now, so much for that. Some of you may
wonder, what about the danger spots? I cant
touch upon all of them, of course, but the ﬁrst one
that must come to your minds is obviously Korea.
We’ve been reading about Korea, and Mr. Dean of
course made a report on the television and radio
on Monday. I’m not going to elaborate on what
he said so well on that occasion. But may I just
say this: That no one can visit Korea without hav-
ing his heart touched by the sacriﬁces that have
been made by the people and by the courage that
they display. Just think of it—in that count
of perhaps 20 million people, 2 million peop e
killed durin the war, civilians and military to-
gether, 8 miﬁion homeless, 200,000 orphans, 300,-
000 widows, 30,000 known amputees. And yet I
have never seen such courage as I saw on the faces
of the people of Korea when we were there on a
cold, cold winter’s day.
Now I have noted that some criticism has been
made of Mr. Dean for his failure to agree to a
olitical conference with the Communists, and just
at me make my position clear on that point. We
should recognize that the time is past when we
should tryl to reach agreement with the Commu-
nists at t e conference table by surrendering to
them. We are paying the price in Asia for that
kind of diplomacy right now. The Communists
know that they can have a political conference in
Korea on reasonable terms any time they are will-
ing to agree. And Mr. Dean would have done a
disservice to the thousands of men who died in
Korea had he sacriﬁced the princi les for which
they fought at the conference tab e. And I for
one think that the American people owe him a vote
of conﬁdence for the manner in which he has stood
up and ﬁnally called the Communists on their tac-
tics of viliﬁcation and delay. So much for Korea.
Let us turn now to another area of the world—
Indochina. And many of you ask this question:
, Why is the United States spending hundreds of
millions of dollars supporting the forces of the
French Union in the ﬁght against communism in
Indochina? I I think perhaps if we go over to the
map here, I can indicate to you why it is so vitally
important. Here is Indochina. I If Indochina
falls, Thailand is put in an almost impossible
position. The same is true of Malaya with its
rubber and tin. The same is true of Indonesia.
If this whole part of Southeast Asia goes under
Communist domination or Communist inﬂuence,
Japan, who trades and must trade with this area
in order to exist, must inevitably be oriented to-
ward the Communist regime. That indicates to
you and to all of us why it is vitally important that
Indochina not go behind the Iron Curtain.
Now may I say that, as far as the war in Indo-
china is concerned, I was there, right on the bat-
tleﬁeld or close to it, and it’s a bloody war and
it’s a bitter one. And may I make the position
of the United States clear with regard to that war.
The United States supports the Associated States
of Indochina in their understandable aspirations
for independence. But we know as they do that
the day the French leave Indochina, the Commu-
nists will take over. We realize as they do that
the only way they can assure their independence
and the only wa they can defend it is to con-
tinue the ﬁght Side by side with their partners
in the French Union against the forces of Com-
munist colonialism which would enslave them.
And ma I also say this, and this we should never
forget, t e free world owes a debt of gratitude to
the French and to the forces of the Associated
States for the great sacriﬁces they are making in
the cause of freedom against Communist aggres-
sion in Indochina.
Now, let me turn just brieﬁ to another prob-
lem, and this is also a big problem. It’s the prob-
lem of China. Because, as we look at China on
the map, we can see that China is the basic cause
of all of our troubles in Asia. If China had not
one Communist, we would not have had a war in
orea. If China were not Communist, there
would be no war in Indochina, there would be no
war in Malaya.
Experiences In China
I have not the time to discuss that problem in
detail. But there are some signiﬁcant things that
I should report to you. One is the strength that
is developing militarily and economically in Free
China on Formosa. And the second is to me one
of the most spectacular developments that has oc-
curred in all of Asia. And that is the way that
the Chinese outside of the mainland of China, the
Chinese who live in Formosa, the Chinese who live
in Thailand and all the other countries, the over-
seas Chinese as they are called, are turning away
from the Communist regime and turning away
from it for reasons that are very, very important.
You say, what are the reasons? Let me give you
a few examples.
I rode along the border between what is called
the New Territories next to Hong Kong and the
mainland of China. As I rode alon the border I
stopped on one occasion and talke to a farmer.
He told me a ver interesting story. It was one
that touched the heart. He told me how he, his
wife, and two small children had walked for 100
miles through the mainland of China until they
arrived at t 1e border of the New Territories in
Hong Kong and then ﬁnall went across the bor-
der so that they could have reedom. And I asked
him, why did he do that? And he said the reason
was that his only brother was blind. His only
brother had the farm next to him. And because
he was blind he couldn’t produce as much as the
Communists required that he produce in order to
pay taxes. And because he couldn’t pay the taxes
the Communists took him away and shot him.
