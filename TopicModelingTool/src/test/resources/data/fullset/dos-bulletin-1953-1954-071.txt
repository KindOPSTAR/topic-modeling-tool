Agreements received Senate approval shortly
thereafter. The necessary formalities having been
completed, the Agreements entered into effect on
September 16, 1953.“ Within a brief time, as an
auspicious beginnin , the Federal Republic of
Germany deposited a ut $17 million as the initial
payment on obligations owed to this Government
and to the holders of German dollar obligations in
accordance with the terms of the agreements.“
The assignment was a challenging one, and it
is a source of great ersonal satisfaction to me
that it proved possib e to ﬁnd a solution to the
problem of the German external debt which ap-
pears to have reasonable rospects of fulﬁllment.
I consider that the task w ich was assigned to me
has been completed. I wish to express my appre-
ciation for the support which was given me by the
Department and the members of my staff.
Sincerely yours,

Security Council Again
Postpones Trieste Discussion
Statement by James J. Wadsworth
Deputy U .8. Representative to the U .N .1
U.S./U.N. press release dated December 14
The Council has met on three occasions during
the past 21/2 months under this item, with the
' ma, Sept. 28, 1953, p. 419; on. 12, 1953, p. 479.
' Ibid., Nov. 2, 1953, p. 598.
result each time that considerations outside the
direct purview of this Council have indicated the
advisability of postponement. During this period,
we are pleased to note, there has been a considerable
decrease in the tension which has at times charac-
terized the relations in this area.
A very notable example of the relaxation of
tension is the withdrawal of troops by both sides.
Other signiﬁcant measures have likewise con-
tributed to the relaxation of tension.
The members of the Security Council are aware,
of course, that diplomatic discussions have been
underway for some time to ﬁnd a peaceful solution
for the present difﬁculties with regard to the prob-
lem of Trieste. It is the ﬁrm belief of the United
States Government that no useful purpose would
be served by a further consideration of the Trieste
item in the Security Council at this time. Discus-
sions looking toward the means for achieving a
peaceful solution are of course continuing. We
are hopeful that fruitful results will be achieved.
For these reasons, Mr. President, I move that.
the Council decide at this time to postpone further
consideration of the Trieste item pending the out-
come of the current efforts to ﬁnd a solution for
this important matter.a
' Made in the Security Council on Dec. 14.
'The Council voted on Dec. 14 to postpone further con-
sideration indeﬁnitely.
