main land, not only for major schemes. but also for many
projects involving only minor pumping from the
Euphrates, which could be completed and put to use com-
paratively quickly. Detailed topographical. engineering
and soils survey would have to be made before the suit-
ability of any given site for a major scheme could be
accurately assessed. but so far government permission
for these surveys has not been forthcoming.
Egypt. The Egyptian Government has been
deeply concerned With the 200,000 refugees at Gaza
and has extended full 000 eration to Usnwa in
loring various possibilities for settling these
re ugees in the Sinai Peninsula. Surveys were
made two years ago for under ound water re-
sources which would be capab e of supporting
refugee communities in that area. The results
of these surveys were negative. During the past
year consideration has been given to the possi-
ilit of si honing water from a sweet water canal
fed y thellﬁle under the Suez Canal to the Sinai
Peninsula, and reclaiming lands in that area
which mi ht beneﬁt some 60 to 70 thousand
refugees. tailed surve s as to the feasibility
and extent of the irrigab 0 area, expected to be
completed within eight months, are now being
made under a program agreement between the
'ptian Government and Usawa, for which $30
million has been reserved by UNRWA.
The work of Unawa described in the foregoing
paragraphs has thus far been conﬁned largel to
negotiations of program agreements and the i en-
ti cation and survey of projects under those agree-
ments. Consequently, ess than 10 percent of the
$200,000,000 reintegration fund has been actually
expended on the reinte ation program, with the
result that relief costs ave continued on a larger
scale than estimated when the three-year rogram
was adopted. The United States and 0 er dele~
gations to the United Nations expressed great con-
cern with the slow progress on reinte ation and
the resulting costs of continuing relic? This sit-
uation was reviewed b the General Assembl at
its current session in View of the expiration o the
authorized term of UNRWA, previously ﬁxed for
J une 30, 1954. The General Assembly, after re-
viewing the report of the Director and Advise
Commission of Uxawa. decided to extend the li e
of UNRWA until June 30, 1955, and to review the
program again at its next session in the autumn
of 1954. It likewise authorized relief expendi-
tures for the ﬁscal year 1954 of $24.8 million.
This increase over 1953 is attributable to the need
to provide additional shelter for refugees moving
into cam s, and to rovide rations for refu ees not
previous y assist . The General Assem ly also
established a relief bud et for the ﬁscal period
1955 of $18 million. Tﬁe following table shows

VII. ".8. Financial Support
The great concern of the United States in the
maintenance of peace and stability in this area of
the world has prompted generous US. support
for the refugee program and the sharing of a igh
roportion of its costs. This has been manifested
y the Congress in its appropriations for the US.
contributions which, since the beginning of the
relief program in 1949, have totalled $153,513,250.
Of this amount, $109,450,000 has actually been
paid, including $43,450,000 for the relief and
works program through June 30, 1951.
In January 1952, a $250 million relief and rein-
tegration program was adopted by the General
Assembly. Toward this program Congress ap-
propriated $50,000,000 for scal 1952 and $60,063,-
250 for 1953 for a total of $110,063,250. Of this
amount, the United States has actually paid the
following:

$50,000, 000 $16, (1)0. 0(1) $66. 000,000
Of the $32 million shown in the table above for re-
integration in 1952, $20 million is still held in a
s is] United States Treasury account on which
NRWA may draw when the funds are needed for
disbursement.
It will be noted from the foregoing that only
$16 million was paid out in 1953, leaving a balance
of $44 million which was not paid. Con re-
appro riated this sum for ﬁscal 1954. t is ex-
pecte that $15 million of this amount will be
paid toward the current year’s relief requirements
with the remaining $29 million being held avail-
able for the reintegration program. In addition,
Congress authorized a sum of $30 million for the
current ﬁscal year on the understanding that an
appropriation under that authorization would not
be sought unless the rehabilitation program moved
forward with such s d that it would be required
during the current figs] year.
The ﬁnancing of the program by contributing
governments has been on a voluntary basis. United
States contributions have been limited to not more
than 70 percent of the contributions of other gov-
ernments. Up to the present time, U. S. pay-
ments have represented approximately 65 percent.
However, as larger expenditures are required by
the Agency for large scale projects, it is expected
that the U. S. will need to furnish 70 percent of
the total. The balance of contributions has come
from 56 countries—the USSR and satellite coun-
tries contributing nothing.
Prior to Congressional authorization and appro-
priation for funds for the ﬁscal year 1954, the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee indicated
concern with the rate of progress being made in
resolving the problem. In the report of its sub-
