Following is the text of a letter dated May 98
from Thmaton B. Morton, Assistant Secretary for
Congressional Relations, to Senator Alexander
Wiley, Chairman of the Senate Committee on
Foreign Relations: 1
DEAR SENATOR WILEY: Enclosed is a statement
concerning the action of the Seventh World
Health Assembly, just completed, on the budget of
the Organization for 1955, which has been re-
quested by Mr. Carl Marcy of your staff. The
World Health Organization budget, as you know,
results in a United States assessment for 1955 be—
yond the existing statutory ceiling of $3 million.
I hope this will meet your needs. We shall be
glad to supply any further information that you
may desire.
Sincerely yours,
THRUSTON B. MORTON,
Assistant Secretary.
1955 BUDGET or THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
AND THE UNITED STATES ASSESSMENT
At the Seventh World Health Assembly, re-
cently concluded in Geneva, Switzerland, the
World Health Organization (WHO) approved a
total assessment for the calendar year 1955 of
$10,049,360 as compared with the 1954 ﬁgure of
$8,963,000. The United States delegation made
every effort at every stage of the proceedings in the
assembly to hold the budget to a ﬁgure not exceed-
ing $9 million, and the United States voted against
the budget as passed.
As a result of the assembly’s action, the assess-
ments of all member countries in the World
Health Organization (some 80 countries) will be
increased. The United States assessment for
1955, which is 33% percent of the total, will
amount to approximately $3,348,000, or $348,000
in excess of the existing statutory limit of $3 mil-

lion on our annual contributions to the re lar
budget of the World Health Organization. inoe
any United States payment to the World Health
Organization for calendar year 1955 will be made
from United States ﬁscal year 1956 funds, the ac-
tion of the health assembly will not affect appro-
priations for ﬁscal ear 1955. Therefore there is
ample time for a t orou h consideration by the
Congress of the roper action to be taken in regard
to the United tates contribution to this organ-
ization.
United States participation in the World
Health Organization was authorized by Public
Law 643, 80th Congress, as amended by Public
Law 806, Slst Congress. after review and approval
by both Houses of the Congress. Since thls legis-
lation, as amended, contains the statutory limita-
tion mentioned above, it will not be possible for
the United States to meet that portion of the
assessment which exceeds $3 million without fur-
ther amendment of this legislation, and such
amendment would require approval by both
Houses of the Congress.
The assessment budget of $10,049,360 ﬁnall
adopted by the health assembly was about hal -
way between the ﬁgure of $9 million proposed by
the United States and the ﬁgure of more than
$11,000,000 which had been proposed by the direc-
tor general and the executive board. The United
States strongly opposed any budget that would
carry the United States assessment over the statu-
tory limitation of $3 million. However, at the
committee stage the United States delegation’s
proposal of a $9 million budget failed by a vote of
24 in favor, 38 against. with 4 abstentions. The
United States reintroduced its proposal in the
plenary session with no better result. At the com-
mittee stage the assembly in fact approved the
more than $11,000,000 requested by the director
general by a narrow vote, but in the plenary ses-
sion it was possible to overturn this action, and a
compromise ﬁgure of $10,049,360 was carried by a
vote of 28 in favor, 24 opposed including the
United States, and 7 abstaining.
The attitude of the majority who took this deci-
sion was that the World Health Organization had
exercised noteworthy economy and restraint in its
whole ﬁscal policy and for 3 years the World
Health Organization assessment budget had, un-
der United States pressure, been kept at approxi-
mately $9 million on account of the United States
ceiling. These governments considered that some
amount of growth in the size of the World Health
Organization’s health programs was necessary and
timely. Not only are other governments contrib-
uting two-thirds of the regular budget of the
World Health Organization, but those who are
receiving World Health Organization assistance
contribute in addition sizable sums toward the
implementation of the projects within their re-
spective countries. These governments felt that
