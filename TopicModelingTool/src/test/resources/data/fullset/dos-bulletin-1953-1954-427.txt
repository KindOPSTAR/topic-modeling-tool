Fourth, we know that India does not at
present desire military aid; yet if she should at
any time change her mind in this regard, we would
be prepared to give any request she might make
the most sympathetic consideration.
India's Attltude Toward Aid
The fourth point perhaps deserves a little ex-
lanation. Some Indians, includin Prime Min-
ister Nehru, seem to have felt that t e President’s
suggestion regarding eventual military aid to
India was uncalled for in view of previous decla-
rations that India disapproved in principle of
foreign military assistance to Asian states. The
American Government was, of course, aware of
this attitude and for that reason the President’s
letter did not make an outright offer of military
aid at this time. It was deliberately phrased to
recognize the current Indian policy but to make
clear that, if that policy should change, the United
States would be lad to discuss the same kind of
collaboration wit India which it now roposes
to undertake with Pakistan and which it as pre-
viously undertaken with many other nations of
the free world. We had hoped the Government
and people of India would accept this as evidence
of good will and 00d faith on the part of the
United States. e also had hoped this would
make it clear that we did not intend to arm Paki-
stan against India, as had been charged by some
Indians.
It is probably still too early to assess deﬁnitively
either the OSItive or the negative results of the
moves whic have now been begun looking toward
the defense of the Middle East and South Asia.
I should like to say, however, that I believe the
advantages will far outweigh the disadvantages
both for the nations of that area and for the
United States and its associates of the free world.
I do not think for one minute that we have
destroyed our friendly relations with India. It
is recognized that the two countries—India and
the United States—follow different routes to the
same objective. As India sees that what we do
has no harmful effects on her or on world security,
I cannot hel but feel that her Government and
people will Il)ose their ap rehensions. In other
spheres I expect that the [lhited States and India
will continue as before to work together. We
must do what we can to insure that collaboration
in the economic, cultural, and social ﬁelds is
strengthened. Above all, we cannot allow our-
selves a policy of exasperation because India pur-
sues a path which varies from our own.
One word of caution may be in order. There
has been much loose talk of alliances in connection
with American aid to Pakistan and the Turk-
Pakistani collaboration. No such binding ar-
rangements are contemplated. As stated in the
communi ue which they have issued, the Govern-
ments of urke and Pakistan lan only to study
methods of collyaboration in ﬁe ds in which they
have mutual interests. The supply of American
military equipment to Pakistan will be based
solely on the normal mutual-security agreement,
which does not commit either Pakistan or the
United States to any military obligations other
than those very general obligations already cited,
to refrain from aggression and to be repared to
assist in their own defense and the de ense of the
free world. We have signed similar agreements
with many countries without any suggestion that
those countries necessarily become allies of the
United States or subservient to the United States.
Etlect ot Turkey-Pakistan lnltlatlve
At the same time, I believe that a real step
forward has been made toward insuring lastin
peace and security for the Middle East and Soutﬁ
Asia, thro h an indigenous movement toward
cooperation etween the nations of the area, with
the assistance, as desired, of the United States and
its allies. We should most certainly be encour-
aged by the initiative which has been taken by
Turkey and Pakistan. This initiative is only a
be inning, but it may produce far-reachin re-
su ts. It is signiﬁcant that the two countries ave
indicated that accession to the agreement which
they pro ose to negotiate will be open to other
like-min ed nations. It goes without sa ing that
the United States would be glad to see ot er states
of the area join in this cooperative relationship,
in their own good time and when and if they
themselves become convinced that it is in their
interest.
It is not too much to hope that what we are
witnessing today ma eventually result in a gen-
eral strengthening o the whole Middle East.
Disunity produces weakness. Unity contributes
to strength. If the Middle Eastern nations can
ﬁnd it within themselves to move forward to-
gether in a common cause of peace and security,
I think that their new unity and strength may
well overcome many of the basic causes of in-
stability and dissension. With some outside help
and encouragement, they can realize great prog-
ress toward viable economies. They can look for-
ward to social advancements. They will have the
means to protect effectively their individual
security.
Above all, they will be making a great contribu-
tion to the security of the free world.
