The Spirit of Inter-American Unity
Address by Secretary Dullea‘
I am ha py to be attending this Tenth Inter-
American onference. I have looked forward to
this ever since becoming the United States Secre-
ta of State. The recent Four Power Conference
at erlin was, at my r uest, arranged to conclude
so as to make sib a my presence here. I
wanted to be here cause in my opinion this Con-
ference reflects the ﬁnest traditions of foreign
policy. It produces solidarity among many na-
tions on a basis of soverei n equality. That rela-
tionship has been tried an tested for many years.
It survwes as an example which others would do
well to follow.
At Berlin there was a good deal of discussion
about this unity of the American states. Mr.
Molotov roposed that it should be copied in
Europe. e produced a draft of a European
security pact' which he claimed was modeled on
our inter-American treaty made at Rio de J aneiro
in 1947.
As I read his draft I saw that many words were
indeed taken from our treat . However, I said
to Mr. Molotov that he coul never reproduce in
Europe what we had in the Americas merely by
copyin words. I directed his attention to the
Preamiile of the Rio Pact which proclaims that
“peace is founded on justice and moral order and,
consequently, on the international recognition and
protection of human rights and freedoms.” I
said that whenever the Soviet Union made such
words a living reality then indeed much could be
done to end the era of danger in which we live.
The fact is that Soviet communism stands for
the liquidation of the values upon which our fra-
ternal association is based. It denies the very
existence of justice and of a moral law. It be-
lieves that peace is not founded on righteousness
but on ower. It does not believe in law as a
shield w ich protects all, whatever be their status,
but rather that law is the means whereby those in

power liquidate their enemies. It does not believe
in human rights and freedoms but rather that
human beings are designed to serve their masters
and to create the means of extending their masters’
wer. It is a mockery for those who hold these
liefs to pretend that the can reproduce on a
European basis that which we have joined to
create here on an American basis.
The death of Stalin has brought no basic change
in Soviet policy. It remains expansive not merely
out of greed but because it fears freedom. That
was the most distressin as ect of the Berlin Con-
ference. lVe discu With Mr. Molotov time
after time, both in formal meetings and privately,
the granting of liberty to the peoples of East
German and Austria. Mr. Molotov said, and I
believe e said with conviction, that the Soviet
Government could not tolerate an extension of
freedom because it feared that freedom might be
abused.
To Soviet Communists, freedom is frightening.
To them it is inconsistent with order. Also they
know that freedom is contagious. That is why
they feel that they will not be safe until they
have liguidated freedom as a major force in
world a airs.
The Threat to the Americas
We here in the Americas are not immune from
that threat of Soviet communism. There is not
a single country in this hemisphere which has not
been penetrated by the apparatus of international
communism, acting under orders from Moscow.
No one of us knows fully the extent of that con-
spiracy. From time to time small parts are de-
tected and exposed.
The earliest postwar exposure of major impor-
tance was made in Canada by a Royal commis-
sion. It showed how Communist ellorts directed
from Moscow had drawn many well intentioned
rsons into a conspiracy to undermine the free
overnment of Canada. In the United States
