have sought and will seek to make this prospect
a. reality.
Knowledge of the efforts being made by our own
nation to lead the world to this goal is another
item of information important to every citizen.
The present administration assumed oﬁice 16
months ago, fully aware of the ruthless manner in
which the Communists negotiate, conscious of the
undependability of their agreements. But we
believed that this country’s foreign policy must
be dedicated to unremitting effort for the preser-
vation of peace, within the enlightened self-in-
terest and fundamental objectives of the United
States. Partisan purposes, personal attitudes, all
the pressures of lesser interests, we believed, had
to be subordinated to this paramount goal.
We knew that every negotiation with the Com-
munists would be fraught with traps and pitfalls,
but we knew, too, that positive, determined, daly-
to-day toil would pay real dividends among t e
free nations. We sought a rebirth of trust among
all nations, an enduring foundation for a coopera-
tive eace—not a mere breathing space free from
imminent crisis.
Every measure we have pro osed has been con-
ceived as a step toward this rebirth of trust. These
roposals have included an honorable armistice in
ﬁorea; a. free and united Germany; a liberated
Austria; a. secure Indochina and Southeast Asia;
atomic energy harnessed for peaceful purposes
under international control.
A New Principle of Freedom
The ﬁrst has been achieved. The armistice in
Korea, moreover, inaugurated a new princi 1e of
freedom—that prisoners of war are entit ed to
choose the side to which they wish to be released.
In its impact on history, that one principle may
weigh more than any battle of our time.
Negotiations to unify Germany have been, for
the time being at least, nulliﬁed by Soviet demands
for a. satellite climate in that count . With re-
spect to Austria, the United States, Great Britain,
and F rance agreed to accept state treaty terms
which up to that moment had been acceptable to
the Soviet Union. But once this acceptance was
announced, the Soviet Union immediately in-
vented new conditions which would enable it, for
an indeﬁnite period, to keep military occupation
in Austria.
To such a plan we could not agree. Far better,
this administration believes, that we end the dis-
cussion with the issue still unresolved than to
compromise a principle or to accept an agreement
whose price might be exacted in blood years hence.
In our effort to ﬁnd the ways by which the
miraculous inventiveness of man should not be
dedicated to his death, but consecrated to his life,
there have been written exchanges of views be-
tween the United States and the Soviet Union.
Secretary of State Dulles has personally conferred
both at Berlin and at Geneva with the Soviet
Foreign Minister, Mr. Molotov. These have not
been productive of the results we seek but we, on
our Side, are continuing exchanges of views and
consultations with the other free nations princi-
pally involved.
We intend to proceed with these and other like
negotiations, conﬁdent in the merits of our cause
realistic in our appraisal of Soviet intention, and
assured that our purposes and ho es will survive
even the most frustrating series 0 talks.
To be successful, our peaceful purposes and
hopes must of course be clad in obvious truth and
constantly proclaimed to the world. Our actions
must stand examination b every eye—friendly
and hostile and doubtful. We must be forthright
and patient in presenting them. Scarcely could
we devise, for t e cause of peace, a more ﬁtting
battle cry than the theme of the Columbia Bicen-
tennial: “Man’s right to knowledge and the free
use thereof.”
Let us not, however, deﬁne truth or knowledge
of the truth solely in the narrow terms of mere
fact or statistic or mathematical equation. Wis-
dom and human understandin —a sense of pro-
portion—are essential. Know edge can give us
nuclear ﬁssion; only wisdom and understanding
can assure its application to human betterment
rather than to human destruction.
In this light, the Columbia theme is a dynamic
idea, a true offspring of the revolutionary doctrine
proclaimed by our forefathers. We should preach
1t—and practice it—fearlessly.
Here, tonight, in this brilliant company and
pleasant surroundings, we might easily take for
granted, as assured through all time, the preser-
vation and the free use of knowled e. Two hun-
dred years of Columbia history and the existence
of thousands of other institutions of learning in
our country seem to give validity to such assur-
ance. But can we be sure that possession of these
values, even by ourselves, is as indestructible as it
is priceless? The bleak history of a dozen nations
insistently warns us differently.
Always and everywhere, even though they may
never have ex erienced it—even though they know
its values on y in their instincts rather than in
their minds—men have sought rsonal liberty;
have fought for it; have died for it.
Nevertheless, within the ast few decades, the
whole philosophy of our ounding fathers has
been reJected by powerful men who control great
areas of our planet. The revolutionary doctrines
of our free society have not, to America’s amaze-
ment, swept around the world. Rather, we have
too often seen the counterattacks of fascism and
of communism substitute for them the police state,
with suppression of all liberties and free inquiry.
We have too often seen education perverted into
an instrument for the use and support of tyranny.
Beyond this, these few decades have seen science
confer upon man technical processes whose colos-
