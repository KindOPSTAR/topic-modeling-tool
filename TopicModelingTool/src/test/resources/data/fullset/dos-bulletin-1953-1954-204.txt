the prosperity and stability of the Near East. There-
fore, the Commission makes the following observations:
(1) Support should be given to the decision of the
United Nations General Assembly to continue the United
Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees
(UNRWA) until June 30, 1955. It should be noted that
the U.S. Delegation to the United Nations voted in favor
of this resolution.
(2) Temporary and stop gap projects are not the so-
lution to the economic distress of the people in this area.
It follows that only a permanent and practical plan of
development is the answer to the economic side of the
refugee problem. The principles of the uniﬁed plan for
the development of the Jordan River appear to be the
best forward step in this direction, inasmuch as water
appears to be the most valued resource in this area, and
in shortest supply. The Commission feels that this will
overcome the inertia enveloping the refugee problem
and give that necessary impetus which would put the
refugees in a position to help themselves and become in-
dependent of the largess of others.
(3) Despite the diﬂicult situation as related to the
refugees, there appear to be favorable opportunities for
permanent economic improvement of refugee families.
This involves the development of irrigation projects and
appurtenant works which, if developed, could improve the
economic condition of a substantial part of this area.
The surveys now in progress should be pursued to com-
pletion as soon as possible to determine if the projects
are feasible and economically sound, in order that agree-
ments can he reached at an early date to clear the way
for commencement of construction.
(4) All available resources, both private and public,
must be used to restore that sense of mutual dignity and
personal respect between the Arab and Jewish peoples
which did exist prior to the outbreak of hostilities. It
is recognized that this cannot be done by legislation or
force. The United States, as an interested party, should
do all within its power to accomplish this end. One cer-
tain way in which this can be accomplished is to state
our objectives clearly and to show our intention to be
impartial and consistent.
(5) To give positive moral assurance to the parties
that we will accept our share of responsibility, together
with the other members of the United Nation, only on
the condition that any and all agreements made will be
kept in good faith.
The Colloquium
A notable event in United States-Middle East
relations that occurred last year was the Collo-
quium on Islamic Culture which opened at Prince-
ton University on Se tember 8, 1953. Some 70
scholars from Middle astern, Asian, and Ameri-
can institutions attended the 12-day conference,
which was a real landmark in U. S. cultural re~
lations with the Islamic world.
The gathering enabled prominent American
scholars to learn more about the problems and
developments of 20th century Islam and at the
same time provided an opportunity for outstand-
ing Muslim scholars to visit the United States and
discuss these problems with Americans working -
in the ﬁeld. Among topics which were discussed
were: “Modern Trends of Literature,” “History
and Ways of Giving the Muslim Youth an In-
terest in Historical Traditions,” “Education in
Muslim Countries,” “Social Reform in the Com-
munities of the Muslim World,” “Law and the
Modernization of Legal Processes in the Muslim
Countries,” “Problems Raised by Modern Science
in the Communities of the Muslim lVorld,” and
“Recent Trends in Muslim Philosophy.”
The dele ates to the Colloquium called on Presi-
dent Eisen ower at the \Vhite House and enjoyed
a 15-minute talk with him. The theme of his
remarks was that understandings based on cul-
tural relations are more lasting than those based
on politics because politics is temporary, whereas
culture is eternal. It is safe to say that this Collo-
quium gave a large number of Islamic scholars a
new understanding of the scope and intensity of
American interest in Islam.
Unliled Plan for the Jordan Rlver
On October 16, the White House announced that
the President had appointed Eric Johnston as a
Special Ambassador to the Near East to discuss
with government oﬂicials there a possibility of
putting into effect a comprehensive lan for the
development of the water resources 0 the Jordan
Valley as a whole. President Eisenhower pointed
out that—
the Government of the United States believes that the
interests of world peace call for every possible effort to
create conditions of greater calm and stability in the
Near East. The administration has continuously under-
taken to relieve tensions in this sensitive and important
area of the free world. . In furtherance of this pol-
icy, I am now sending Eric Johnston to the Near East
as my personal representative with the rank of Ambas-
sador to explore with the governments of the countries
of that region certain steps which might be expected to
contribute to an improvement of the general situation in
the region.
Then on November 4, US. delegate James P.
Richards said in the U.N. Assembly's Special Po-
litical Committee that “this is a time for decision
in the Near East” and called on the Near Eastern
Governments to give “the most thoughtful and
careful consideration” to the proposed Jordan Val-
ley development plan. Pointin out that the
United States was a cosponsor o the resolution
calling for continuation of the U.N. Relief and
Works A enc for Palestine Refugees until June
1955, Ricliar s emphasized that something more
was needed. He said:
Ready as the United States and other nations abroad may
be to help with services and funds, the programs so far
proposed cannot hope to solve the problem. . . . We
look for a real disposition, both in the Arab States and
in Israel, to take bold and statesmanlike measures to
assure the success of the programs now envisaged and of
others which must be developed.
Two days later authoritative sources in Wash-
ington said that failure of the Near Eastern Gov-
ernments to accept the proposals made by Eric
Johnston would not cause the United States to
withhold aid from those states. However, it was
noted, the level of aid would depend primarily
upon the development of sound and suitable r0]-
ects, particularly in the water-development eld.
It was made clear that the US. was not trying to
