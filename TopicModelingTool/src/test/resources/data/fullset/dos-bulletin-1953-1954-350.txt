The [V ear and Middle E ast—With the exception
of . ria and Yemen, all states of the Near and
Mid le East had signed general agreements for
technical coo eration by 1953, and some pro ess
had been made as to a number of programs. hus
it was announced on January 13, 1953, that
Thomas D. Cabot, a prominent business executive,
had arrived in Egypt to advise and assist in devel-
oping Egyptian industries under a technical co-
operation program. The purpose was to stimulate
actual development, including the location of spe-
ciﬁc opportunities, recommendation of action
necessary to attract investment in particular ﬁelds
and sites for industrial development, and the de-
velopment of general plans for advancing in-
dustrialization in consonance with the aims of
Egypt’s general economic and social development
program."
Moreover, on March 19 a large-scale program
was announced in which the United States would
assist Egypt in reclaiming wastelands and re-
settling farmers. The United States was to con-
tribute $10,000,000 to a joint fund, with the Egyp-
tian Government contributing the equivalent of
$15,700,000 in Egyptian pounds; an Egyptian-
American Rural Improvement Service would be
established to administer the fund. According to
reliminary estimates, some 20,000 acres in the
Iiaheira area and 60,000 acres in the Fayoun were
to be reclaimed by drainage and other measures,
and some 16,000 families were to be resettled. This
rogram represented a major expansion of Amer-
ican assistance to Egypt, and was to be developed
around villages, the accepted pattern of Egyptian
rural life. The project also included assistance
in the organization and operation of cooperatives,
demonstrations of improved water conservation
and management practices, training of agricul-
tural extension and other rural-service workers,
and advice to farmers in management and im-
proved methods."
Under a technical cooperation agreement. the
Government of Saudi Arabia has been assisted
in revising and modernizing its entire tariﬁ and
customs system, as a part of a broader undertaking
for systematizing the entire ﬁscal and monetary
structure of the Government. A monetary agency

was established, a system of Government control
over expenditures and recei ts was inaugurated,
a new currency law adopte , ground-water sur-
veying and water-well construction continued and
expanded, surveys completed for the Riyadh-
Jidda railway, the ﬁrst commercial school started,
and preliminary work completed on a cooperative
community-development program, which is to be
a large-scale effort on the part of the Saudi
Arabian Government to improve the economic
and social conditions of villa "
On April 7, 1953, the U.S. Technical Coopera-
tion Mission in Baghdad signed an agreement with
Iraq to provide technical assistance in carrving
out the vast Miri Sirf (state-owned lands) land
development and resettlement program, ultimately
involvmg some 19,000,000 acres, about two-thirds
of which are considered capable of some develop-
ment. Three projects are now in operation. in-
volving some 200,000 acres and 1,600 families,
while other projects, in various stages of develop-
ment. involve more than 1,000,000 acres and 10,000
families. The Miri Sirf project is one of the
largest and most signiﬁcant efforts of its kind
in the Near East, to which a considerable amount
of Iraq’s oil reserves are being devoted. The proj-
ect involves enormous problems, such as the sur-
veying and classiﬁcation of lands according to
their agricultural capabilities, lanning and con-
struction, assistance in farm p anning and man-
agement, credit facilities, establishment of schools
and provision of teachers, development of health
clinics, and guidance in the formation and opera-
tion of cooperatives. A major diﬁicultv is the
general lack of technicians in Iraq. “*hile the
a ment provides for no additional allocation
0 funds or rsonnel, the Technical Cooperation
Administration (now the Foreign Operations
Administration) is to assist in planning the pro-
gram and supplying technical advice, train Iraqi
technicians, aid in research and survey work, and
provide some demonstrational equipment and sup-
plies necessary to teach improved methods."
In response to an urgent request from Jordan
for assistance when the spring rains were small
and late and a disastrous crop failure resulted, the
United States provided grant aid of up to 10,000
