Never before has the art of the “big lie” been so
boldly practiced.
I would not have you think that we are com-
placent about the colonial situation. Abuses per-
sist, and there has been a slowin down of the
process of granting increased se f- overnment.
That, however, is largely due to the oviet Com-
munist strategy of using nationalism as a device
whereby it can absorb the colonial peoples.
Stalin, in one of his classic lectures which is now
part of the Communist bible, outlines the strate
of “amalgamation” by means of “alliance with t e
liberation movement of the colonies and dependent
countries.” He outlines a two-phased program—
a program of duplicity. In the ﬁrst phase the
Communistic agitators are to whip up the national-
istic aspirations of the people so that they will
rebel violently against the existing order. Then,
before independence can become consolidated and
vigorous in its own right, the Communists are to
take over the new government and use the power
to “amalgamate” the peoples into the Soviet orbit.
That plot is in active operation. Throughout
the newly liberated areas and those which seek
liberty, Communists operate, usually disguised as
local patriots. They are, in fact, the new imperi-
alist colonialists.
What is going on in Indochina is a classic
example of this Communist strategy. There, a
Moscow-indoctrinated Communist, Ho Chi-Minh,
was sent ﬁrst to China and then to Indochina to
exploit the nationalistic aspirations of the people.
In Indochina, he utilized a revolutionary move-
ment that attracted much genuine native support.
He committed it to a violent effort which could
only succeed with the aid of training and supplies
from the Communist countries. This created a
dependence upon external Communist support
such that if any of the peoples of Viet-Nam, Laos,
or Cambodia should now end in the control of
Ho Chi-Minh, they would not, in fact, be inde-
pendent. They would be amalgamated into the
Soviet-Chinese Communist orbit under a ruthless
dictatorship, accepting the iron discipline of the
Soviet Communist Party as the self-proclaimed
“general staff of the world proletariat.”
In much of the world the conditions created by
Communist strategy are such that the realization
of genuine independence has become a task of
inﬁnite difﬁculty and delicacy.
I can assure you of two things:
1. The United States is pushing for self-govern-
ment. We do so more than is publicly known, for
in these matters open pressures are rarely con-
ducive to the best results.
2. When we exercise restraint, it is because of a
reasoned conviction that quick action would not,
in fact, produce true independence. Indeed, in
some situations hasty action would spell confusion
and division which would be the transition to a
captivity far worse than present dependence.
The United States some time ago outlined the
conditions which, in its opinion, would justify
the creation of a collective defense of Southeast
Asia. At the head of the list of those conditions
was the stipulation that there must be assurance
that the French will, in fact, make good on their
July 3, 1953, declaration of intention to grant
complete independence. The United States will
never ﬁght for colonialism.
Collectlve Security Systems
The United States in addition to its loyal mem-
bership in the United Nations, is also a member of
various regional and security arrangements.
These are authorized by the United Nations Char-
ter, and they 0 erate within the framework of
that charter. he two major security arrange
ments are that created by the Rio Pact of t e
Americas, with 21 member nations, and that
created by the North Atlantic Treaty, with 14
members.
It is, perhaps, unfortunate that security has to
be sought other than in the United Nations itself.
The United Nations Security Council was designed
to have “primary re onsibility for the mainte-
nance of internationa peace and security.” But
it is not de endable because of the veto power. In
the case 0 the aggression against Korea, the Se-
curity Council was able to function because the
Soviet Union was at that time boycotting the
Security Council. In the main, however, the veto
power has been so misused by the Soviet Union
which has cast 58 vetoes, that the Security Counc'
is not dependable.
Because of this paralysis of the Security Coun-
cil, certain nations, which were bound together by
ties of fellowship and of common danger, have
organized for their collective security under article
51 of the United Nations Charter.
These organizations also face their problems.
Indeed, both the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion and the Organization of American States
treaties face diﬂicult tests.
NATO
In Western Europe, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization has been built on the assumption
that there would be created a unity in Western
Europe which would embrace both France and
Germany and end the possibility of such differ-
ences as, in the past, have led to recurrent wars of
evergrowing intensity. To that end, the French
proposed a European Defense Community. It
would comprise six nations of Western continental
Europe, which would create a European Army,
which in Europe would wholly replace their na-
tional armies. This would mean that there would
