limited. Eﬂ'orts toward uniform laws in the for-
eign ﬁeld as well as in the domestic ﬁeld have been
lar el conﬁned to private grou s. The American
and: tate Bar Associations, t e American Law
Institute, the American Society of International
Law, and the American Arbitration Association
have been active in this ﬁeld.
This is not to im ly that the Federal Govern-
ment in general an the Department of State in
particular are not active in the ﬁeld of conﬂict
of laws. On a day-to-day basis the State Depart-
ment and its ofﬁcers overseas perform numerous
tasks indispensable to the functioning of legal
systems across national boundaries. Some of these
are of a procedural nature, such as the takin of
testimony by our consular oﬁicers abroad, an ex-
tradition to and from the United States of persons
charged with crimes.
But the Department also participates in the de-
velo ment of the substantive law of conﬂicts, par-
ticu arl in ﬁelds falling within the province of
the Fe eral Government, such as interstate and
foreign commerce. For example, in the ﬁeld of
maritime commerce, the Department has encour-
aged legislation in conformity with maritime law
and the adjective law of the great trader nations.
It has also negotiated important multilateral
treaties on this subject such as the Carriage of
Goods b Sea Act (49 Stat. 1207) and the Conven-
tion on afety of Life at Sea (50 Stat. 1121).
As you know, American companies are the
world’s atest operators of international air-
ways. any of t eir planes are mortgaged to
banks which have ﬁnanced their construction and
acquisition, and as they 0 erate all over the world,
the question of maintaining the validity and pri-
ority of such mortgages is essential.
In order to secure recognition by other nations
of rights, mortgages, and interest in aircraft, this
count negotiated an international Convention
on the nternational Recognition of Rights in Air-
craft. Thus far three countries have ratiﬁed the
convention, but it is hoped that in the near future
many more will ratify.
The heart of the convention is contained in
article I, which provides that the rights in air-
craft—including rights ac uired through ur-
chase, lease, or mortgage—s all be reco ize by
the contracting states if the rights have en con-
stituted and recorded in accordance with the law
of the state in which the aircraft is re 'stered. All
ri hts must a pear in the same recor . The order
of; riority or satisfying claims in connection
wit recorded rights is ﬁxed by national law. N 0
transfer can be made from the register of one
party to another until all holders of recorded
rights have been satisﬁed or agree to the transfer.
There are also provisions dealing with other phases
of the application of national laws, salvage opera-
tions, ﬂeet mortgages, and so forth.
In most activities in the ﬁeld of private inter-
national law, the State Department and other
government agencies cooperate with the private
grou s interested in the same subjects. We work
close y with the American Bar Association’s sec-
tion on international and comparative law and the
various committees of that section. For example,
two of the important items considered by the
ABA at its most recent convention in Boston
parallel similar projects of the State Department.
One of these is the development of practical
methods of international cooperation in such
bread-and-butter ﬁelds as securing the serVice of
judicial documents on nonrmidents, and obtaining
information on foreign law.
Most of you know only too well the difficulties
that one is apt to encounter in regard to these prob-
lems. In many parts of the world it is virtually
impossible to serve a paper on a non-American
without the costly aid of a foreign lawyer. Nor
are the problems of foreigners abroad with similar
matters in this count free of difﬁculty and dela .
Problems in this ﬁe d are becoming increasing y
important as the United States expands its com-
merce and investments abroad. Liti ation across
national boundaries grows rapidly. n 1939 there
were 13,239 Americans residing abroad. In 1952
it was estimated that there were more than 500,000.
Historical] the United States has been back-
ward in the eld of international judicial assist-
ance. The status of judicial assistance in matters
relatin to common law countries is bad, but it is
inﬁnite y worse as respects those countries which
have legal systems greatly divergent from our
own and this includes the great majority.
While provisions have been inserted in some
treaties intended to aid in this ﬁeld, a much more
practical and fruitful ap roach would seem to be
the fostering of uniform aws in this ﬁeld through
coo erative international study and discussion.
oday the problem is being attacked in this
country on at least two fronts simultaneousl .
One endeavor concerns our participation in t e
work of the Inter-American Council of Jurists.
At its latest meeting in Buenos Aires in 1953, the
Council adopted a report which “ur ed that the
objective in this ﬁeld should be that t e end prod-
uct should consist of rules suitable as idance for
inclusion in the internal legislation oflfhe Ameri-
can Republics, with a view to the attainment of
greater uniformity of legislation and procedure.”
The re ort formulates eight rules or principles
on the su jects of letters rogatory, service of proc-
ess and the gathering of evidence abroad, and the
role of consular and other foreign ofﬁcials in
judicial assistance. The Council stressed the need
for further study before any concrete steps were
taken. It was the preliminary conclusion of that
body that progress in the ﬁeld could best be made
by the adoption of uniform laws rather than
through the conclusion of treaties.
The American Bar Asociation considered this
problem at its recent session in Boston. It recom-
mended the implementation of a plan originally
