But there is more to the sto than the Inter-
national Joint Commission. T e desire to work
together pervades all relations between our two
countries. One of the great international projects
of our time, the St. Lawrence Seaway, has been
largely the concern of agencies of both countries
WlllCh have together over a period of years
amassed the necessary technical data and studied
the best means of coordinating the construction
efforts of the two nations.
And we cooperate for other purposes besides the
develo ment of our resources. The most urgent
task 0 our generation—the need for self-preserva-
tion against ruthless and ag ressive enemies,
armed with weapons of unprecedented power and
destructiveness—ﬁnds Canada and the United
States acting together in reparing for mutual
defense. There has never een any thought that
we might act otherwise. There have been prob-
lems in this joint defense effort, to be sure. But
the have always been treated simply as problems
to e solved, and not as difﬁculties, or obstacles,
which could for one moment separate us in our
joint endeavor.
S0, alongside the Alaska highway, the coopera-
tion of Canada has made poss1ble the construction
of the Haines-Fairbanks pipeline, which reaches
largely across Canadian soil to bring vital fuel
and oil to our bases in Alaska.“ The two govern-
ments are joint] constructing air-raid warning
installations on anadian soil which will provide
protection to the great cities in both countries.4
And up at Churchill, the Canadians are sharing
with us their facilities and, more important, their
experience, in order to help give American troops
more realistic training in Arctic operations.
In short, this Niagara Remedial Project, though
unparalleled among other nations, is typical of the
type of cooperation which pervades all ﬁelds of
the relations between Canada and the United
States. We maintain joint weather stations in
the Canadian Arctic. Through the International
Boundary Commission, we have provided means
for amicable adjustment of all boundary questions.
The new Joint Economic and Trade Committee
opens another ﬁeld of international cooperation
which has far-reaching potential signiﬁcance.“
It is against this background that we meet today
to inaugurate construction of the Niagara Falls
Remedial Project.
The problem of preserving and enhancing the
beauty of Niagara Falls has been studied by rep-
resentatives of both Canada and the United States
for the past 50 years. Ever since the turn of the
century, people have been concerned because the
crest of the Falls has been receding and because of
the harmful effect of past activities in the diver-
sion of water for power. As long ago as 1929, a
special International Niagara Board submitted a
report setting forth certain objectives to be fol-
lowed in controlling the waters of Nia ara. But it
was not until Februar 27, 1950, t at the two
governments negotiate a treaty callin for the
construction of remedial works to fu ﬁll these
objectives.“
In this treaty, we recognized the obligation to
maintain the beauty of the Falls as a primary
objective and stipulated that the common interest
in obtaining more power must be pursued only in
ways which are consistent with that overriding
purpose.
The International Joint Commission created an
International Niagara Falls Engineering Board to
solve the complex technical problems involved.
This Board reviewed all past studies of the prob-
lem and then made exhaustive engineering studies
of its own. It drew into the work a tremendous
array of technical talent. Segments of the re-
search were undertaken by many agencies—the
Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario;
the Canadian De artments of Resources and De-
velopment, and 0 Transport; the Buffalo District
and the United States Lake Survey of the Great
Lakes Division, U. S. Army Engineers: the Fed-
eral Power Commission; and the Engineers’
Waterways Experiment Station.
They used helicopters, balloons, echo sounders,
and searchlights to survey the swift and turbulent
waters above the Falls. A major part of the work
was done on two great hydraulic models, one at
the U.S. Waterways Experiment Station at Vicks-
burg, Mississippi, and the other set up by the
Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario at
Islington, near Toronto.
\Vhen the studies were ﬁnished, the Engineering
Board submitted a detailed report recommending
a plan of remedial works to the Commission. The
Project was approved by the two Governments;
then it was returned to the International Joint
Commission for construction. The Commission
again appointed an International Board of Engi-
neers to supervise the job, and the actual work
was assigned to the Hydro-Electric Power Com-
mission of Canada and the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers.
The plan calls for a control structure above the
Canadian side of the cascades and for excavation
and ﬁlls on both ﬂanks of the Horseshoe Falls.
The control structure will be a long, low barrier,
extending out from the banks 1,550 feet into mid-
stream and equipped with sluice gates. Its pur-
pose is to preserve the beauty of American Falls
by maintaining the level of the pool above the
falls. It will also keep the bed of Grass Island
pool covered at all times, and insure that the upper
