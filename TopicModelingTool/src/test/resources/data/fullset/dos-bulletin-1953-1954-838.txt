across the demarcation line, the circulation of
printed matter, and others, and thus facilitate a
ra prochement between East and West Germany.
11 your letter of reply, you in essence avoid
these pro osals, referrln to the fact that ques-
tions of t e movement 0 citizens, circulation of
the press in Germany, etc., “must continue closel
to concern the four occupying powers until suc
time as the reuniﬁcation of Germany takes lace.”
Meanwhile, it is impossible to a ree wit such
an interpretation of the rights 0 the occupying
powers in Germany. The circumstance that no
pgace treaty for the reuniﬁcation of Germany has
en agreed to among the four occupying powers
by no means signiﬁes that the occupying authori-
ties, not having settled with the German people,
nor with the fact that on the territory of Germany
at the present time there exist the government of
the German Democratic Republic and the govern-
ment of West Germany, can i ore the right of
the German people freely to etermine their in-
ternal aﬂ'airs according to their own judgment,
without foreign interference.
From your letter, it is evident that you depart
from those principles set as the basis for the rela-
tionships of the occupying authorities of the
U.S.A., and of England and France also, with
the German authorities and inhabitants of West
Germany. These principles are well-known, as
far as they are set forth in the “occupation statute”
today in eﬂ'ect in West Germany, and also in the
Bonn Agreement,” which is nothing but another
aspect of the “occupation statute” signed among
the governments of the U.S.A., England, and
France and the West German government of Ade-
nauer. In conformity with these documents, the
occupying authorities of the three Western
powers in reality keep in their hands for at least
a 50-year term the broadest rights of interference
in the internal affairs of West Germany.
The Soviet authorities cannot be equated with
the regime tied to West Germany by the occupying
authorities of the U.S.A., England, and France,
as such a regime is unjust with respect to the Ger-
man people and its national rights, and damaging
the interests of upholding peace in Europe, es-
pecially if one takes into account that the Bonn
agreement is tightly bound to the Paris Agree-
ment,8 in accordance with which West Germany
is transformed into a militaristic state, correspond-
ing with the plans for creating the so-called
European Defense Community.
In connection with this I take the liberty of
drawing your attention to the declaration of the
Soviet Government of March 26, in which it was
demonstrated that the Soviet Union establishes
' I. e., the contractual agreements with the Federal Re-
public of Germany, signed at Bonn on May 26, 1952.
'I. e., the treaty establishing the European Defense
Community, signed at Paris on May 27, 1952.
with the German Democratic Republic the same
relations as with other sovereign states and that
the German Democratic Republic will be free to
decide, b its own judgment, its internal and ex-
ternal a airs, including questions of interrelation-
ships with West Germany. In the declaration, it
was also pointed out that “the existence of the
‘occupation statute,’ established for West Germany
by the United States of America, England, and
France, is not only incompatible with the demo-
cratic princi les and national rights of the Ger-
man people ut, in the present circumstances im-
endlng the rapprochement between \Vest and
East Germany, 1s one of the obstacles on the road
to the national reuniﬁcation of Germany.”
All the foregoin sufﬁciently explains why the
Soviet side, as be ore, considers it necessary to
take measures to create the aforesaid all-German
committees in the very near future by means of
agreement between corresponding agencies of
lVest and East Berlin.
So far as the question of West Berlin, touched
upon in your letter, is concerned, the American
occupying authorities up to now have taken no
steps to liquidate criminal or anizations situated
on the territory of West Ber in and carrying on
their injurious work against the German Demo-
cratic Republic, although, as is known, that very
circumstance has obliged the government of the
GDR to put into effect some measures to control
trafﬁc on the territory of the Gun.
AMBASSADOR CONANT TO MR. SEMENOV,
MAY 24
Press release 278 dated May 24
I acknowledge receipt of your re 1 , dated
April 17, 1954, to the second letter {had sent
you, on March 17, 1954, putting forward positive
suggestions for the elimination of unjustiﬁable
obstacles which prevent freedom of movement for
Germans between the different parts of Germany.
In my letter of March 17, I drew your attention
to unilateral measures which the authorities in
the Soviet Zone could themselves take to this end
without the need for any further consultation be-
tween us. I regret to note that no action has so
far been taken by the authorities in the Soviet
Zone to put these measures into effect and that
you do not even refer to them in our reply. I
further regret that you have ma e no res onse
to my suggestion that arrangements shou d be
made Wth would enable discussions to begin
between German technical experts on those pro-
posals in my letter of February 22 ‘ on which con-
sultation is required.
Instead you have invoked the Soviet Govern-
ment’s statement of March 26 regarding the sta-
‘ BULme of Apr. 5, 1954, p. 508.
