Netherlands has agreed to the issuance of the cer-
tiﬁcate in principle only ; details of the agreements
with this country still have to be worked out. It
will readily be seen that it would be unwise and
wasteful to hire staff as long as it is uncertain
whether, because of the absence of an agreement
concerning the certiﬁcate of readmission, the
refugee program can be operated in a given coun-
try or area.
The other important factor which inﬂuences the
planning for the Refugee Relief Pro am is the
difficulty of anticipating the volume 0 assurances
for the various groups of refugees, expellees, and
orphans who may come to the United States under
the Refugee Relief Act. Up to April 30, 5,046
assurances have been received in the Department
of State for all groups of refugees, escapees, and
orphans. Of these assurances, 138 are for orphans.
For refugees and escapees in Germany 880 assur-
ances have been submitted; in Austria 357; in
Greece, 2,726; in Holland, 8. The remaining 937
assurances are for refugees and escapees in Bel-
glium, France, Norwa , Portu al, Sweden, Japan,
ong Kon Israel, ransjor an, and other areas
in the Miféie and Far East. 604 of the 5,046
assurances are underwritten by voluntary organi-
zations recognized b the Administrator.
I should like to illustrate the existing problem
in the case of Germany. As stated, 880 assurances
have been received for refugees and escapees in
Germany. They may cover some 1,200 to 1,400
persons. Under the circumstances those respon-
sible for the administration of the act have to de-
cide whether it is administratively sound and
justiﬁable from the taxpayer’s point of view to
send into Germany a staﬁ' large enough to issue
visas in these cases within a 1- or 2-month period
with the possibility that not sufﬁcient additional
assurances are received in time to justify the re-
tention of this staff ; or whether it would be more
prudent to send a small staff into Germany and
step up staffing as it becomes apparent that sufﬁ-
cient assurances are at hand to complete the issu-
ance of the 90,000 visas authorized for Germany
and Austria. The same problem exists in most
other countries in which the refugee program
could operate.
The situation is quite different in regard to rela-
tives in Italy and Greece since many more ap-
proved visa petitions are at hand than visas are
authorized to be issued for these groups. For ex-
ample, as of April 30 the Department of State
has received 42,111 approved relative petitions for
Italian beneﬁciaries but only 15,000 visas may be
issued to Italian relatives under the Refugee Re-
lief Act. Should a bill already passed by the
House become law it would be possible that the
45,000 visas authorized for issuance to refugees
in Italy and the 15,000 in Greece also be used for
the issuance of visas to the relative groups in each
of these countries.
Role of Voluntary Social Agencies
What is the role voluntary social agencies can
play in relation to the Refugee Relief Program?
irst of all, agencies can do a very important job
by disseminating accurate information on the
Refugee Relief Act and the opportunity it offers.
\Vhile the required assurance forms are available
directl from the De artment of State and also
throug the various eld ofﬁces of the Immigra-
tion and Naturalization Service, the Adminis-
trator appreciates the cooperation of voluntary
agencies willing to act as distributing centers for
these forms.
Agencies conversant with the technical re uire-
ments of the Refugee Relief Act can be 0 real
service to American communities in assisting with
the preparation of assurance forms and their sub-
mission to the prescribed government agencies.
Agencies with representatives abroad may ﬁnd
ualiﬁed workers to ﬁll the demand for special
ills speciﬁed by a sponsor. Other agencies which
are particularly equi ped to work with refugees
may apply to the A ministrator of the program
for recognition. Once recognized, they may un-
derwrite assurances of an individual citizen and
may certify the availability of housin in the
absence of a public housing authority w ich can
perform such function.
The role of state and voluntary agencies in the
orphan program of the Refugee Relief Act is of
particular signiﬁcance since their participation is
required in conducting the investigation of the
proposed adoptive home and parents and of the
orphan himself. Also, in the case of orphans to
be adopted in the United States, as stated earlier,
an appropriate agency has to assume responsibil—
ity for the supervision of the orphan pending his
legal adoption and, if the adoption petition is
denied by the court, for the care and resettlement
of the orphan.
Since the volume of assurances will determine
the pattern and the success of the act’s adminis-
tration, obviously the voluntary agencies can make
their greatest contribution by making the law
known throughout the country and by helping
those willing to sponsor refugees with the fulﬁll-
ment of the law’s requirements.
In closing, I should like to bring you the per-
sonal greetings of Mr. McLeod, the Administrator
of the Refugee Relief Program, and his assurance
that all those in the Department of State con-
cerned with the Refugee Relief Act are making
every effort to interpret and administer the law
reasonably, sympathetically, and in accordance
with the intent of Congress. WVe count on your
help and cooperation in making the act better
known throughout the American communities
and to make it successful by relieving the plight
of those who are anxious to ﬁnd a permanent home
in the United States.
