Heavy equipment has been imported to help
speed up construction of ﬂood control and irriga-
tion dams on India’s rivers, for which the country
itself is making a large ﬁnancial outlay. The
Indo-American technical program includes also
a community development program, to bring better
cultivation methods, better health practices, and
literacy training to the nation’s rural population.
Technical Cooperation Survey
In Surinam and British Guiana
The de arture of a group of American techni-
cians for urinam and British Guiana in January
to discuss the initiation of programs of technical
cooperation for those countries was announced
on December 23 by the Foreign Operations
Administration.
The survey group is being sent to the two coun-
tries in res onse to requests from their govern-
ments whic were transmitted to FOA by the
Netherlands and the United Kingdom Govern-
ments.
Eugene Clay, Director of the Northern Latin
American Division of Foa, and W. Alan Laﬂin,
Foa Regional Engineer for Latin America, will
head the oup. Other members will include
specialists in the ﬁelds of agriculture, education,
health, and community development.
The economy of Surinam IS largely agricul-
tural. Its most important products are rice, citrus
fruits, coffee, sugar, cocoa, and coconuts. The
country has large forests but has not been able
to develo its wood indust adequately mainly
because 0 trans rtation di culties. Asa result,
the loggin wor has been concentrated along the
banks of e count ’s rivers.
The chief minera being ex loited presently is
bauxite, and the country is t e largest exporter
of this material. In 1952, 3 million tons were
e rted.
e an sted technical coo ration pro m
may invo ve rojects in the ﬁe ds of agrrcu ture,
forestry and sheries, vocational and agricultural
training, housing, internal transportation and dis-
tribution, and perhaps public health.
The economy of British Guiana is largely de-
pendent on sugar cane and the government is
interested in technical cooperation pro ms to
help improve the standard of living 0 agricul-
tural workers.
