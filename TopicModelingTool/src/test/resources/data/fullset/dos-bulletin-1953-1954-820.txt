Continuing Recognition of Free China
There is another reason why we cannot acce t
the Peiping regime as representative of t e
Chinese people. We have no intention of turning
our backs on the Republic of China on Formosa
or of forsaking the 10 million Free Chinese on
that Island to a fate of Communist tyranny. We
believe that the Republic of China is far more
representative of the will of the Chinese people
than is the re 'me on the mainland. It continues
to represent hina in the United Nations ably,
responsibly, and with dignity.
It is highly important that at this juncture,
when attention is focused u on the Chinese Com-
munist rggime, primarily ecause of its outra-
geous con not, we not forget the real and potential
importance of the cause of Free China. There
is abundant precedent for the free nations’ con-
tinued recognition even of overnments in exile,
for considerations dictated y reason and prin-
ciple when those overnments retain no terri-
torial control or mi itary potential. Free China,
however, is a going and growing concern, which is
developin in increasingly favorable contrast to
the conditions of tyranny and oppression imposed
on the mainland b its would-be successor regime.
That it has yet falledi fully to achieve, by its own
ready admission that standard of democratic ex-
cellence by which it is often judged is hardly sur-
prising, considering the facts that it has had only 6
years of constitutional government, is in a period
of acute national emergency, and with extremely
limited national resources is called upon to support
a disproportionately large military establishment
and maintain the morale and loyalt of civil
servants on a below-subsistence leve of pay.
Even with outside aid this is a large order. The
surprising thing is that the Island is as stable as
it is, that the economy, with its several weaknesses,
is as strong as it is, that its military potential
grows as it does, that morale both among the mili-
tary and the civilian population is as high as it is,
that the Island is as free from subversion as it
is, and that in these troublous times there is as
much freedom of the ress, speech, and person
as there is. I have live in both Communist China
and Free China, and I am unable to view the
appellation “Free China” as any misnomer. It is
deserving of free world support.
The United States will continue its military,
economic, and political support of the Govern-
ment of the Republic of China, and we will con-
tinue to support it as the representative of China
in the United Nations. The Chinese Communists,
in their extravagant propaganda, continue to
speak of our “forceful occupation” of Formosa.
This is preposterous, as all the world knows. Our
advisers and technicians are there at the express
invitation of the Government of China, to help it
maintain its economic and political stability and
to assist the Chinese to develop and maintain a
military establishment capable of defending the
Island from Communist invasion and to make a
greater contribution as an important part of the
anti-Communist armed mi ht in opposition to
Communist aggression an expansion in the
Paciﬁc.
Such, in brief is the problem and the promise
presented to us by a divided China at this hour
of grave crisis in Asian and world histor . To
meet this hour at Geneva and elsewhere With the
degree of sober responsibility for which all men
who treasure freedom look, requires all the reso-
luteness, faith, wisdom, ﬁrmness, patience, and
understanding which we can summon. It would
be idle at this point to speculate upon the outcome
of the im ortant conference now being held at
Geneva. be next few days may be decisive. But
there can be little doubt that the issues with which
we are concerned at Geneva provide another
severe test of the very princi 1e of collective se-
curity on which may rest the ate of hundreds of
millions of Asians, and ultimately of us all.

Press release 284 dated May 25
At his news conference on May 25, a correspond-
ent recalled to Secretary Dulles his re art to the
Nation following his return from eneva 1 in
which he set forth the conditions under which the
United States intervened in Korea. Mr. Dulles
was asked to relate those conditions to the Indo-
china situation. Mr. Dulles made the following
reply:
I ointed out, I think, the existence of certain
con 1tions in the case of Korea, and I went on to
say that the situation in Indochina was diﬁerent
and more complex.
I think that broadly speaking the attitude of the
United States toward this situation has been made
clear by statements which the President has made
and which I have made. I think it is fair to say
that the United States attitude in this matter has
been one of the few stable aspects in an otherwise
changing and ﬂuid situation.
The position of the United States toward col-
lective security in Southeast Asia has been known
basically for quite a lon while. In fact, it really
oes back to the time w en I went out to the Far
ast in, I think, January of 1951 on a mission to
