have been unable to report or investigate any pos-
sible violations of the Armistice. Since the
Czech and Polish members of the NNSC have sub-
scribed to and supported the views of the Senior
Member, KPA and CPV, MAC, before making
proper investigations of violations to the Armi-
stice Agreement, as re uested by the Senior Mem-
ber of the UNC, MA , it appears clear that the
NN SC has been paralyzed to such a degree that it
cannot carry out its pledged obligations as out-
lined under the terms of the Armistice Agreement.
The acce tance of the KPA and CPV views of the
letters 0 19 January, 27 January, and 12 Febru-
ary, respectively, by the members from Poland and
Czechoslovakia, Without consideration of the evi-
dence submitted by the UNC, serves to prevent
other investigations for substantiated charges of
violations of the Armistice Agreement committed
by the KPA and CPV.
9. It is obvious that the exercise of the full re-
sponsibilities of the NNSC is conﬁned to the area
of the UNC. In the territory under the military
control of the KPA and the CPV, the NNSC has
been unable to conduct investigations as provided
for in the Armistice Agreement. The Czech and
Polish members of the NNSC, and the Senior
Member of the KPA and the CPV, MAC, have
obstructed the work of the NNSC to date, and
their recent statements appear to reclude the
NNSC from ever performing all of) its pledged
obligations in the future. In view of the outright
repudiation by the KPA and CPV of this portion
of the Armistice Agreement, and the inability of
the NNSC to carry out the obligations charged to
it by_ the same agreement, the UN C considers that
its rights as a srgnator to the Armistice Agree-
ment have been deniedy it. There is to date no
indication that the NNSC either can or will fulﬁll,
in the area under the military control of the KPA
and CPV, the full obligations which its members
undertook b accepting oﬁice on the NNSC.
Neither has t e NNSC acknowled ed the fact that
in prohibiting ins ections lawfu y requested b
the UNC the KP and CPV have in effect um-
laterally abrogated that part of the Armistice
Agreement applicable to the functions of the
N NSC in the territory under the military control
of the KPA and CPV.
