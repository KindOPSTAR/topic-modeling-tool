Oblectlves of U. S. Pollcy In Europe

I think it is generally accepted today that the
essential objective of my job is very similar to
ours. The main business of American diplomacy
is to rotect the security of the United States. In
fact, think it’s fair to say that our foreign policy
is our ﬁrst line of defense.
This has not always been true in the past. At
least, it has been true only in a very limited sense.
Throughout most of our history as a nation, the
security of the United States was affected onl to
a relatively minor extent by what happene in
other parts of the world. We had trade interests
and property interests that needed protection, of
course, and we were also re uired to offer protec-
tion and services to American citizens abroad.
Furthermore, because of our ties of tradition and
friendship with other nations, we took a keen in-
terest in many foreign developments. However,
the fundamental security of the United States was
not threatened in any serious way.
This was true for two reasons. In the ﬁrst place,
this Nation was separated from other parts of the
world by vast oceans, and no nation or likely com-
bination of nations then possessed the technical
means to launch a successful invasion of this con-
tinent. Second, the only possible combination of
power ca able of threatening the United States
was foun on the continent of Europe, and Europe
was divided into a number of nations competing
with one another. In other words, there was a
“balance of power” in Europe which prevented
any nation or bloc from becoming a serious threat
to our national security.
Two developments have occurred during the
ﬁrst half of the 20th century which have revolu-
tionized our foreign policy and, perhaps, our en-
tire manner of livmg. First, as a product of such
technical developments as the airplane, the sub-
marine, the atomic bomb, and so forth, the oceans
which once guarded our shores have lost much of
their rotective value. Durin this same riod,

down. Three times within this half century we
have faced the ossibility that the entire European
Continent mig it fall under the control of a smgle
hostile aggressive ower. Our military forces
have fought two ma]or wars primarily to prevent
this catastro he to American security interests.
At the en of World War II, our essential mili-
tary objectives had been achieved. We had also
accomplished our rincipal immediate political
objective. At the eight of Hitler’s power, he
had control of all of Western and Central Europe
and a substantial portion of Russia. If the United
States had remained strictly neutral, it is more
than ossible that he would have eventuall added
the ritish Isles and the entire Soviet nion to
his empire, as well as large portions of Africa and
the Middle East. \Vhen we remember how much
military power Nazi Germany was able to muster
through the resources of Western Europe alone,
we can more clearly a preciate what dangers we
might have been force to endure if the resources
of the United Kingdom and Russia had been
organized and harnessed to the Nazi war machine.
Postwar Dlvlslon ot Europe
At best, however, our political ob'ectives were
only partially realized and were rea ized only at
a tremendous rice. At the end of the war, Rus-
sian armies hag overrun most of Eastern and much
of Central Europe. It soon became evident that
these armies could be dislodged only by force.
Half of Europe had fallen to a dictatorship which
was soon to rove implacany hostile to the United
States. And) the remainder of Europe was gravely
threatened. It looked for a while as if we had
saved the Eurasian Continent from the Nazi and
J0. anese dictatorshi s only at the cost of having
it all victim to the oviet dictatorship.
Even the conquest of Eastern Europe had left
the Soviet domain far short of the empire of which
Hitler dreamed—and nearly achieved. Three
hundred million Europeans were still free. They
lived in nations which, for centuries, had domi-
