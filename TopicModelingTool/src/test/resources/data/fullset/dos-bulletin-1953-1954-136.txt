and functioning effectively. It has gathered to-
gether a group of civil servants who owe their
allegiance to the Euro ean Communitv and not to
the member states. T ie decisions of the Commu-
nity in the common interest have been loyally
accepted by the member states.
Measures for European Defense
As I have said, the Coal and Steel Community
was intended only as the beginning. But the next
step came more quickly than might have been
expected. While the Coal and Steel Treat was
bemg negotiated the Communists struck in orea.
This attack, and the fear that Europe might be
next, focused attention on the pitiful weakness of
its defenses. It soon became apparent that effec-
tive defensive strength in Europe would require
participation of German forces.
France, which opposed any revival of a Ger-
man national army, drew on the example of the
Schuman Plan for a solution. In the fall of
1950, M. Pleven proposed the creation of a Euro-
pean army, integrating French, German, and
other units under European institutions. In May
1952, the six states initialed the draft treaty for
the European Defense Community. It has been
ratiﬁed by West Germany and the lower houses
in Belgium and the Netherlands, and awaits ap-
proval in France, Italy, and Luxembourg.
In its essence, the European army idea was
even more radical than that of the Coal and Steel
Community and involved more formidable difﬁ-
culties. It dealt, after all, with more vital issues,
charged with deep-seated loyalties and antago-
nisms and impinging directly on the individual
citizens who serve in its military forces or who
must make ﬁnancial sacriﬁces for their support.
Furthermore, the close tie between military and
tfpreign policies calls for some means to harmonize
em.
In view of these facts, it is not surprising that
the powers granted by the Defense Treaty are
relativel less complete than those under the Coal
and Stee Treaty. The framers of the treaty were
aware that, as a result the Defense Community,
as it stood, would hardly be viable over the lon
run. As a temporary expedient, the gaps could
be ﬁlled by the existence of N ATO and of the ro-
cedures established there. But before very long
it would be essential to ex and the wers of the
Defense Community, and in view 0 its vital na-
ture of activity, this would not be feasible unless
its institutions were constructed ultimately on a
broader democratic base.
'I’he Pelltlcel Cemmunlty
Accordingly, the Defense Treaty included a
ial provision (article 38) to meet this need.
Lnder it, the Assembly of the Defense Community
was assigned the constituent role of working out
and submitting to the government a stronger
framework for a federal or confederal structure,
to be based on a bicameral legislature and on the
separation of powers between it and an executive.
This work was to begin only after the treaty had
been ratiﬁed. Durin the summer of 1952, how-
ever, the Foreign Ministers of the six countries
decided to request the Coal and Steel Assembly,
slightlly augmented, to draft a statute for a Euro-
pean olitical Community. The work began at
once and was pushed ahead energetically. By
March 1953, a draft statute was ready and was
submitted to the six governments, which are at
present considering it.
A political community is the logical and prac-
tical next stage in the process of federation. This
project, as now developed in draft, would set up
stronger political organs for the Coal and Steel
Community and, when realized, the Eve. Build-
ing on the earlier structures, it would include e
popularly chosen parliamentary assembl , execu-
tive organs, and a judiciary. It would aim at the
progressive achievement of a common market
among the member states, with free movement of
goods, capital, and persons. This project is being
and will continue to be heatedly debated.
Prospects for the Future
Statesmen of vision have evolved in Europe a
unique process of federation tailored to the pe-
culiar problems and diﬁiculties that face them.
The distinctive feature of this procem has been
in developing federal institutions, stage by stage
through succemive agencies, Wieldin limit
powers in speciﬁc ﬁelds. This method as made
possible an immediate start in applyin the fed-
eralist solution to pressing current pro lems. It
relies on a cumulative process of growth and grad-
ual fulﬁllment. It assumes that existing residues
of traditional and nationalist thinking may best be
chan ed through actual experience and example.
This method provides an inner compulsion to-
ward growth. Once certain functions are dele-
gated, once partial communities are established,
their initial success can create pressures to widen
their functions and cure their deﬁciencies. The
commitment embodied in the ste 5 already taken
leads to the next logical step. e rapid start
with the Political Community Treaty shows how
effectively this com ulsion can operate.
But the method a so involves serious risks. The
same deﬁciencies which provide motives to go
further can, if not cured, undermine the communi-
ties already created. A process of this sort cannot
stand still; it must go forward or seriously recede.
That is the risk inherent in it.
\Vhat, then, are the prospects? No one can say
for sure. In terms of need, certainly, European
unity has an aspect of ultimate inevitability. No
other way has been proposed to enable Euro to
achieve security, economic health, and socia sta-
