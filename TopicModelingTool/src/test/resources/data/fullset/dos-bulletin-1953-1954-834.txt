shipping, particularly with the United States.
Argentina, Brazil, and Chile have all increased
their merchant ﬂeets substantially. In addition,
several other countries have embarked on joint
shippin ventures. This has, naturally, resulted
in much eener competition for United States ship-
ping companies operating in Latin America~
I think it oes without sa ing that American
business of al kinds has we comed competition.
And I think it also goes without saying that the
U.S. shipping interests operating in Latin America
today are not complaining about com etition from
foreign ﬂag carriers. They are comp aining about
discriminatory practices, and I believe that when
free competition is hampered by discriminatory
practices this does become a matter of concern to
our government.
Ellmlnatlng Discrlmlnatory Practlces
With other government agencies, and with rep-
resentation of the shipping industry, the Depart-
ment has been diligently working to eliminate
discriminatory practices. And we have made
some progress. One of the most heartenin de-
velopments has been the success which we iave
achieved in various aspects of this problem as a
result of negotiations with Colombia, Venezuela,
and Brazil. The same is true, to a lesser extent,
with Argentina and partial progress has also been
made with Chile.
We are makin progress but we are doing so
slowly. Discrimination still continues and onl
sustained, vigorous representations can, wit
time, eliminate such discrimination.
When we meet in Rio de J aneiro next November
with the other American Republics to discuss our
mutual economic problems, we shall continue our
efforts to assure competitive opportunities for U.S.
business. I think that the system of inter-Ameri-
can conferences and meetings is a mechanism
which is still not too well understood or appreci-
ated in the United States. And I also think that
such understanding and appreciation by all of us
is essential if the inter-American system is to con-
tinue as a model of international relations. There-
fore, I would like to spend a little time telling you
about the latest and in some ways the most sig-
niﬁcant of the inter-American conferences—the
Caracas conference from which I recently
returned.a
In a nutshell, Latin America wants: (1) United
States assistance in assuring “fair and equitable”
prices for their raw materials; (‘2) assurances of
stable tariffs and an expanding United States mar-
ket for their products; (3) ﬁnancial and technical
cooperation in their economic development. It is

clear that we cannot wholly satisfy these aspira-
tions. In the case of prices, we have a mutual in-
terest in satisfactor price relationshi s since this
means rosperity or all concerned, ut we cer-
tainly db not have the resources even to consider
rice-parity formulas or plans involving vast
nancial commitments. We can assist in efforts
to diversify the economics of the Latin American
countries, thus lessenin dependence on one or a
few export products an possibly take other meas-
ures to mitigate the effects of price ﬂuctuations.
However, the best assurances we can offer of rela-
tive stabilit and “fairness” of prices is to main-
tain the hig 1 level of U.S. economic activity which
is the major factor in raw material demand. In
the ﬁeld of commercial policy we must resist the
arguments of those friends of ours in Latin Amer-
ica who hold that only we should reduce barriers
to world trade and that they should be permitted
to maintain any and all obstacles to the ex ansion
of such trade. On the other hand, we are opeful
that by the time of the Rio conference we Will be
in a position to deﬁne our commercial policy ob-
jectives and give reasonable assurances regarding
its continuity.
It is in the ﬁeld of economic development where
the greatest possibilities exist for the formulation
of a dynamic inter-American policy. There are a
number of obstacles, none unsurmountable, which
complicate this problem of olicy formulation.
Latin America comes honest y b ' a heritage of
state intervention in economic a airs, a herita e
coming down from Spanish colonial times. 11
addition, mild to severe cases of economic na-
tionalism have aﬁlicted large parts of the area and
given rise to a number of dangerous hobias which
make the rational development 0 resources at
times difﬁcult and complex and at others, impos-
sible. Oﬁ'hand, I can think of several situations
where the unfounded fear of foreign rivate par-
ticipation is holding back the development of
certain im ortant countries and making it im 0s-
sible for tffem to raise effectively the standar of
living of their people.
U.S. Reliance on Prlvate Enterprlse
Against this background our own ex erience
throughout the 19th century, when the .S. was
going through a period of economic development
in many res ects similar to that taking place to
the south 0 us today, led to the conviction that
domestic private enterprise plus the helping hand
of foreign private capital and know-how was the
way to build a stable and enduring economic struc-
ture. Indeed, our continued experience during the
present century has only conﬁrmed in our own
minds that the way of economic life which goes by
the name of private enterprise is the sound and
true gospel. Certainly one of our deepest convic-
tions is that governments, save in unusual situa-
tions, should stay out of business, whether as pro-
