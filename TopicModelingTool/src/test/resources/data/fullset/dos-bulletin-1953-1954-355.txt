The Right to Freedom and Self-Determination
by Mrs. Oswald B. Lord
U49- Representative in the U .N . Commission on Human Rights 1
It is nice to be back here again. When my bus-
band and I were here several years ago, we liked
it so much that we were determined to come back
at the ﬁrst 0 portunity, but I little thought we
would be bac on an occasion like this. I feel
very humble and very shy before such a distin-
guished group, and it is indeed a privilege and a
great honor to address you.
The hospitality on have shown us already in
the short time we have been here is a worldwide
tradition. Four hundred and sixty years ago,
Christopher Columbus landed on the west coast
of Puerto Rico. He and his descendants brought
to you the culture of Spain. As your Governor
has so well said, being on the frontier of two great
cultures has given you the opportunity to work
out a destiny different from and better than the
destiny of millions of people throughout the world.
In July 1952 we formalized a new relationship
between the people of Puerto Rico and the people
of the United States.2 This status of Puerto Rico
is a remarkable demonstration of political free-
dom and self-determination. This places Puerto
Rico as an important link in understanding be-
tween the United States and our Latin American
friends. It laces you in a favored position to
interpret to t e world the meaning of liberty and
democracy.
Today is the birthday of Abraham Lincoln.
N earl a century ago he spoke these solemn words
of de ication: “Our fathers brought forth on this
Continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and
dedicated to the proposition that all men are
created equal.” These statements are basic to the
conception of human rights. Human rights are
also most important on the international scene.
Not only do we all wish to persuade people against
communism—and of course we have constant
vigorous running battles to achieve that—but we

Session of the Puerto Rican Legislative Assembly.

want to spread wide around the world the doc-
trine of the supremacy of the individual, a faith
in the dignity of man and of his ability to shape his
own future. We want the business interests of all
countries to understand the merits and the methods
of operation of the free-enterprise economic sys-
tem—the un aralleled driving force of individual
initiative which has made our countries great.
You have done this and our great Governor has
taken the leadership in this endeavor. You have
diversiﬁed our economic life from a primarily
agriculturafcommunity through infant industry
laws whereby private industries can be attracted
to Puerto Rico, and all this has resulted in a phe-
nomenal development marked by the addition of
hundreds of private industries.
Right to free s eecb, freedom of the ress, free-
dom of worship, reedom of assembly, a these are
channels through which the common ever day citi-
zens seek and receive information about t eir work
and about new methods of work; about their liv-
ing conditions, good or bad, and the reasons for
them; about their local ofﬁcials, their state ov-
ernments, and their national government. en-
ever any of these channels are blocked, whenever
free speech or free press is inhibited, whether by
law or by the arbitrary rule of a dictator or by
fear generated by oups of intolerant wealthy
people—whenever t ese things happen the deci-
sions of our society are warped, are misshapen,
and the common good suﬂ’ers. Our national secu-
rity then is actually threatened.
When the President called on me to serve on
the Commission on Human Rights, there were
many reasons why I accepted, but uppermost was
my personal conviction that nothing is more im-
ortant today than safeguarding these rights.
Tfollow the work of the United Nations in this
ﬁeld with the deepest interest, and I ﬁnd it a
great privilege to do what I am doing. Our ap-
proach to the roblem of human rights, like our
approach to ot er problems in the United Nations,
8 ould be that no nation is perfect and that there
is room everywhere for improvement.
