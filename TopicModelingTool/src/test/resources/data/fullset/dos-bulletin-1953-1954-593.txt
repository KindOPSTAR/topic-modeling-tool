premise of ossible French withdrawal. Insofar
as the use 0 United States forces in Indochina was
concerned, he was stating a course of possible ac-
tion which he was ersonally prepared to support
under a highly unli 'ely hypothesis.
The answer to the question correctly emphasized
the fact that the interests of the United States
and other free nations are vitally involved with
the interests of France and the Amociated States
in resisting Communist domination of Indochina.

Present United States Pollcy Toward China
by Alfred le Sesne Jenkins
Oﬂicer in Charge, Chinese Political Aﬁairs ‘
In recent ears we have often heard it said that
more heat than light has been cast on the China
uestion. I am not sur rised at the heat, nor do
object to it, provided t ere is also sufﬁcient light.
The fate of one-fourth of the world’s population
is not a matter which can be taken lightly, and
the addition of China’s vast material and man-
power resources to the Soviet bloc is a matter in-
volving not only the security interests of the
United States but those of the entire free world.
I do not see how one can help feelinv strongly
about these matters. We need not apo ogize that
our thinking about China is charged with feeling.
National policies are an expression of national
interests concerning which there is naturally much
feeling, and our policies are an expression both
of what we are and of what we want. We are a
nation of free peoples. We want to remain free
to ‘pursue in peace our proper national destiny,
an we want the same freedom and rights for
others.
We do not believe that the Chinese Communist
regime represents the will of the people it con-
trols. First capitalizing on the natural desire
of the Chinese people to enjoy full recognition
and respect for their importance in the world
community, the regime then proceeded by its
“lean-to-one-side” policy to betray the powerful
Chinese longin s to stand up strai ht. It has
followed slavis ly the leadership 0 the Soviet
Union and attempted to emulate it in all its ways.
With the aid of thousands of Soviet advisers it
‘ Address made before the American Academy of Politi-
cal and Social Science, Philadelphia, Pa., on Apr. 2.
has set about methodically to change the entire
fabric of traditional Chinese culture, substituting
communism’s materialistic, atheistic doctrines
wherein the state is the be-all and end-all and the
individual its pawn.
The regime at ﬁrst attracted considerable sup-
port, principally through its sponsorshi of a land
redistribution program, but 1s now, a ter estab-
lishment of the prer uisite police-state controls,
taking the land away rom the owners in the same
collectivization process which is familiar in other
Communist countries and which invariably has
brought suffering in its wake. China’s much ad-
vertised “New Democracy” is of course in reality
“old communism.”
From its inception the regime has proclaimed
a “lean-to-one-side” policy in foreign affairs, and
has left no doubt about its dedication to the ropo-
sition of world Communist revolution un er the
leadership of the Union of Soviet Socialist Re-
publics. While its “leaning-to-one-side” has not
brought it to the position of com lete “ rostra-
tion-to-one-side” characteristic 0 the astern
European Soviet satellites, there is not the slight-
est eVIdence that this indicates any se aratist tend-
encies. The difference in status 0 Peipin in
its relationshi with Moscow (as distinguis ed
from that of t e Eastern European satellites) is
rather due chieﬂy to its having come to power
without beneﬁt, except in Manchuria, of Soviet
Army occupation; to the prestige of Mao Tse-
tung, arising from his long histmy of leadership
of Chinese communism and his literary contri-
butions to theoretical communism; to China’s as-
sumption of the role of leadership in the Com-
