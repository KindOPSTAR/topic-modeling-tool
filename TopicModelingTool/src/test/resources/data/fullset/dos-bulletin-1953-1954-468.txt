DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN : This is to inform you that,
pursuant to Section 103 (b) of the Mutual Defense
Assistance Control Act of 1951, and in accord-
ance with the recommendation of the Director of
the Foreign Operations Administration, concurred
in by the Department of State, the De artment
of the Treasury, the Department of De ense and
the Department of Commerce, I have directed the
continuance of United States assistance to Den-
mark, France, Italy, Norway and the United
Kingdom, because the cessation of aid would
clearly be detrimental to the security of the United
States.

Sincerely yours,
Dwrou'r D. EISENHOWER
RECOMMENDATION OF DIRECTOR OF
FOREIGN OPERATIONS ADMINISTRATION
.Mancu 3, 1954
Dean Ma. Pansmanr: Under the Mutual De-
fense Assistance Control Act of 1951 (Battle
Act), it is necessary to report to you concerning
shipments of commodities of rimary strategic
importance which countries of t e free world have
permitted in the course of their trade with the
Soviet bloc.
Most of these shipments continue to be “prior
commitments”—that is, shi )ments resultin from
commitments that were ma e prior to the egective
date of the Battle Act embargo provisions. Others
are the results of more recent commitments which,
in unusual circumstances, “'estern countries have
considered necessary or in the long run beneﬁcial
to themselves and to the free world, because of
the two-way trade that was made possible by the
strategic shipments.
This letter has to do with shipments permitted
b Denmark, France, Italy, Norway, and the
Ignited Kingdom.
I have carefully examined these cases. And I
concur in the judgment of m Deputy for Mutual
Defense Assistance Control, ice Admiral Walter
S. DeLany, U.S.N. (Ret.) , that this country in its
own interest cannot afford to use these shipments
as a basis for terminating United States assistance
to any of the ﬁve countries involved, because such
termination would clearly be detrimental to U. S.
security. This is also the judgment of the Depart-
ment of State, the Department of Defense, the
Department of Commerce, and the Department of
the Treasury.
Therefore, as Director of Foreign Operations
res onsible for the administration of the Mutual
De ense Assistance Control Act of 1951, I hereby
recommend that you exercise your authority under
Section 103(b) of this Act and direct the contin-
uance of aid to Denmark, France, Italy, Norway,
and the United Kingdom.
Section 103(b) forbids all military, economic,
and ﬁnancial assistance to a countr that know—
ingly permits the shipment of items listed for em-
bargo under the Act, except that the President
“may direct the continuance of such assistance to
a country which permits shipments of items other
than arms, ammunition im lements of war, and
atomic energy materia s w en unusual circum-
stances indicate that the cessation of aid would
glearlygie detrimental to the security of the United
tates.
