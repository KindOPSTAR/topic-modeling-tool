Facing Realities in the Arab-Israeli Dispute

Tonight I shall speak of the Middle East. Pub-
lic addresses on this subject often take the same
form. There is a general review of the importance
of the Middle East, and this is stated in terms of
its people, its strategic location, and its natural
resources. One covers the economic and political
problems of the area. Then there is an outline of
the role of the United States in attempting to
assist in the development and stability of this im-
portant area. It is within this context that a
speciﬁc problem of the Middle East is usually dis-
cussed. This format is used because such an ap-
proach aids immeasurably in putting each spe-
ciﬁc problem in the context where its true impor-
tance can be properly evaluated.
I am going to reverse this procedure tonight
and talk more about a speciﬁc problem and the
hearing it may have upon the Middle East as a
whole. I refer to the Arab-Israeli complex of
problems. There is a stereotype presentation on
this subject as well. One covers the history be-
hind the conﬂict—the divergent points of view—
and such advice as he can muster for a solution.
I wish to reverse this procedure as well and de-
vote my time to a few fundamentals that, in my
opinion, lie at the very roots of this dispute.
I shall begin with certain developments within
our own country. It is natural for an American,
surrounded as he seems to be with the necessities
of life at hand, to be to a certain extent an isola-
tionist. The American is moved from that posi-
tion only reluctantly and only when he senses de-

velopments overseas that may change his way of
life. Apart from a basic instinct of humanitarian-
ism, he does not wish to concern himself with
matters overseas unless this appears to be a
necessity.
Thus the thoughts of Americans are turned
largely within our own country exce t in event'of
war or threat of war that can a ect our own
security. America had the luxur of concentrat-
ing its attention almost exclusive y upon its own
development until fairly recently. The ﬁrst World
War involved our forces in Europe, and America
came to know Euro e far better. This was an
interest which lasted ecause the making and pres-
ervation of eace was a vital interest to us. The
second world)conﬁagration took us to the Far East
as well as to Euro e. America a ain had a costly
lesson in geograp and again as retained her
interest because 0 the uneasy and interrupted
peace that has followed. In these interruptions
we have come to know Korea, and now Indochina
is a familiar spot on the map to nearly every
American.
With all of these developments, America now
knows that insecurity almost anywhere in the
world can affect our own security. It is with this
new realization that American eyes turn toward
the Middle East. This time we are determined
that our attention will be focused on an area rior
and not subsequent to an outbreak of hosti ities
that may affect us.
In looking toward the Middle East, America
sees an area generall defenseless and with such
internal and externa problems as to submerge,
in the thinking of its people, the real danger we
