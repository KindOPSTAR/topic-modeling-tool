serve. If it is put to a vote, I shall abstain on the
inclusion of India on the subcommittee.
Let me say, however, that the United States is
very much in favor of hearing a full ex osition of
the views of the Government of India. IWe would,
therefore, favor an invitation to India to send a
representative to the subcommittee at an earl date
to express her views, and in fact the United tates
intends to pro ose such an invitation to the sub-
committee at t e proper time.
Mr. President, the Soviet re resentative argued
that the subcommittee would so lopsided that
the Soviet Union would be outvoted. He is in
error. There is no outvoting and there will be
no outvoting in the subcommittee because there
isn’t oing to be any voting. Nations will be
boundg only by their own vote. We believe that
an “acceptable solution,” which is what the Gen-
eral Assembl resolution calls for, means a solu-
tion acceptab e to all members of the subcommittee,
to the Soviet Union as well as to all other members.
When the subcommittee is set up we expect to take
the osition that it should not vote at all, just as
the isarmament Commission never voted except
on strictly rocedural matters. So there is nothing
to worry a out there.
Mr. President, let us be candid with each other
and with the public. The pendin pro osal of
the United Kin dom is the world’sgbest ope for
disarmament. hose who favor disarmament will
sup ort it. Those who vote against it will inevita-
bly regarded as being 0 posed to disarmament.
Now, those are hard wor s, but that is the hard
fact. All else is propaganda, legalism, technicali-
ties, and surplusage. A thinly veiled threat to
walk out which is what the representative of the
Soviet Union has made, is also a thinly veiled
threat to torpedo the peace. The choice before us
is simple. The stakes are immense. Let us act
like men and hesitate no longer and thus we can
lead the world to peace.
Armistice Agreement Violations
Following is the text of a letter dated A
from Maj. Gen. J. K. Lacey, Senior U.S.
sentatz've on the Milita
Korea, to the Neutral

Armz'stice Commission in
ations Supervisory 00m-
1. For investigation of violations of the Ar-
mistice Agreement by the KPA/CPV [Korean
People‘s Army/Chinese People’s Volunteers] side,
during the period 29 November 1953 to 9 February
1954, the following facts are presented for your
immediate consideration.

‘ For information concerning the composition and func-
tions of these commissions as described in the Korean
Armistice Agreement, see BULLETIN of Aug. 3, 1953, pp.
134—137.
2. On 29 November 1953, after the KPA/CPV
in a meetin of the MAC [Military Armistice
Commission? refused to submit a jomt letter to
the NNSC [Neutral Nations Superwsory Commis-
sion], the UN C [United Nations Command] uni-
laterally requested the NNSC to investigate the
case of three soldiers apprehended by the UNC on
19 November 1953 in the Joint Security Area.
These three soldiers were identiﬁed beyond ques-
tion to be former soldiers of the ROKA [Republic
of Korea Army]. The lace and date of their
ca ture by the KPA/CP was ﬁrmly established.
Although ample evidence was available to verify
the fact that these persons were impressed into
the KPA/CPV military units, and were retained
after 24 September 1953, a clear violation of para-
aph 51 of the Armistice A cement by the
PA/CPV, the Czech and Polis 1 members of the
NNSC refused to participate in any proceedings
for the consideration of this critical matter as a
violation of the Armistice Agreement.
3. On 18 December 1953, after the KPA/CPV
in another meeting of the MAC again refused to
submit a joint letter to the NNSC, the UNC uni-
laterally, and for the second time, requested the
NNSC to investi ate the case of two individuals
apprehended by t e UNC, South of the Southern
boundary of the Demilitarized Zone on 10 Decem-
ber 1953. These individuals, as in the case of the
three ROKA persons previously cited, were also
identiﬁed beyond question to be former soldiers of
the ROKA who had been impressed into the
KPA/CPV military units. Their retention after
24 September 1953 constituted a second clear vio-
lation of aragraph 51 of the Armistice Agreement
by the PA/CPV. For the second time, the
LNSC failed to take an action on a unilateral
request from the Senior {Iember of a side as an-
thorized in paragra hs 28 and 42F of the Ar-
mistice Agreement. or the second time, the Czech
and Polish members of the NN SC refused to ar-
ticipate in the performance of their solemn ob iga-
tion under the terms of the Armistice Agreement.
4. On 18 January 1954, and again on 26 J an-
uary 1954, the UNC submitted separate unilateral
requests to the NSC to investigate speciﬁc mili-
tary units of the several ROKA persons, who had
been impressed into the military service of the
KPA/CPV, in order to ascertain whether these
and other individuals had also been forcibly de-
tained in the territo under the military control
of the KPA/CPV. or the third and fourth time,
respectively, the Czech and Polish members of the
N1\ SC again refused to cooperate in the investi-
gation of KPA/CPV violations of the Armistice
Agreement. The arguments presented by the mem-
bers gave every indication of being mere excuses
to prevent the NNSC from conﬁrming KPA/CPV
violations of the Armistice Agreement in the ter-
ritory under the military control of the KPA and
the CPV. Particularly signiﬁcant, however, was
the fact that the responses of the Polish and Czeeh
