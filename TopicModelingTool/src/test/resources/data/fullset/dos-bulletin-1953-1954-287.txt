armistice agreement. And we believe that, if
possible, these views should be reconciled.
However, the United States holds that these
divergent views indicate that this Council should
not attempt to interpret by resolution what the
parties’ interests, rights, and obligations are.
This is for the parties themselves to resolve in ac-
cordance with the provisions of their own armistice
agreement under the aegis of General Bennike.
We, as the Council, as the sponsors believe, are
merely here requesting and authorizing him as the
Council’s agent to assume a necessary initiative
in this matter. What is more, we are not invest-
ing him with new and extraordinary powers which
he did not already have assigned to him under
that agreement.
As Sir Gladwyn Jebb has already pointed out,
we have been at this job for some time. Some
13 weeks have ela sed since the matter ﬁrst re-
ceived the Councils consideration, and with due
regard to the fact that the new members of the
Council have had to ac uaint themselves with a
most complicated set 0 issues, we nevertheless
believe, and it is my Government’s ﬁrm view, that
it would be in the general interest—in the inter-
est of everyone concerned, members of the Coun-
cil, parties to the dispute and all the rest—to
proceed as swiftly as possible to action on this
resolution today.‘
Progress Toward Self-Rule
in African Territories
Statement by Mason Sears 5
U.S./U.N. press release dated February 3
For a number of reasons the discussions on olit-
ical progress in the Trust Territory of the rit-
ish Cameroons, which is jointly administered with
Nigeria, has given much satisfaction to the U.S.
delegation.
First of all, it appears from what has been said
and from the reports before us that the colonial
days of these regions are coming to an end with
the rapid approach of full self-government.
New constitutional developments in Nigeria
and the Cameroons and also in nearby territories
indicate that the time is nearly at hand when a
large part of West Africa, involving a huge popu-
lation of around 40 million people, will have
achieved self-determination in superseding their
colonial status.

‘ The vote in the Council on Jan. 22 was 7—2 (Lebanon,
U.S.S.R.), with Brazil and China abstaining. The Soviet
veto was its 57th.
' Made in the Trusteeship Council on Feb. 3. Mr. Sears
is U.S. representative in the Council.
This will do much to deﬂate the issue of colo-
nialism which is being used to hamper and divide
the free world in its resistance to the attempted
ex ansion of the ca tive world.
t also happily orecasts that unless they are
blackballed by the veto of an unfriendly power it
will not be long before several new African States
can pro erly look forward to representation in the
United ations.
Beyond these comments we have nothing to
suggest, since we are convinced that the United
Kingdom, throu h its administrators, is doin a.
splendid '0b in t ie Cameroons as well as in 0t er
parts of est Africa.
These developments are having great political
impact internationally and lend much encourage-
ment to the progress of sound and stable self-gov-
ernment in the other trust territories as well as
throughout Africa and the rest of the world.
