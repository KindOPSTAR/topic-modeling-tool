is credit will be consolidated with an existing
credit of $12 million made by the bank in 1951.
The consolidated credit of $24 million will hear

Australia Barrows $54 Million
From International Bank
On March 2 the International Bank for Recon-
struction and Development made a loan of $54
million to the Commonwealth of Australia. The
loan will be used for the import of capital goods
and equipment needed for develo ment in the
following ﬁelds: agriculture and orestry, road,
rail and air transport, electric power, and various
industries. The loan will bene t both private and
public enterprise; goods imported with the pro-
ceeds will be used by farmers, private businesses,
and Commonwealth and State authorities.
About one-quarter of the bank’s loan will be
used for agriculture. Although Australian in-
dustries are growing rapid] , agriculture still ac-
counts for 80 percent of t e country’s earnings
from exports. In recent years, much stress has
been put on raising agricultural production and
farmers have materially increased their pure ases
of tractors, hay balers, and other mechanical
equipment. At the same time the Commonwealth
and State governments have been pushing ahead
with projects to increase land use and roduc-
tivity through reclamation, irrigation, an water
conservation. The foreign exchange provided by
the current loan will make possible continuing im-
ports for the improvement of existing farms and
for opening up new areas to cultivation. Trac-
tors, earth-moving equipment, farm implements,
harvesting equipment, and components for their
manufacture in Australia will be bought under
the loan. The loan will also provide tractors and
forestry equipment for the exploitation of forest
resources.
'stock. Under t is loan, funds will be
About three-ﬁfths of the loan will be used to
improve transportation. Australia’s rapid eco-
nomic growth has put increasin burdens on trans-
ort facilities of all kinds, an the problem has
een accentuated by the long distances to be
traveled on the continent. Both Commonwealth
and State authorities have been carryin forward
extensive plans to improve roads and i hways
and to expand rail service through the a dition
of modern equi ment, motive power, and rollin
rovide
for the import of medium and heavy true 5 suited
to Australian road conditions and for equipment
to construct and maintain roads. One million
dollars of the loan has been allocated to railway
improvement and will be used mainly to purchase
components needed for the manufacture of diesel
locomotives in Australia.
Much of the amount allocated to transport will
be used to modernize and expand air-travel serv-
ices. Air transport plays an important role both
domestically and in international travel to and
from Australia. Australia’s stable climatic con-
ditions are favorable to air transport, and an ex-
tensive network of scheduled air routes has been
in operation for many years. The new loan will
hel pay for four four-engined aircraft to be used
in omcstic service and for eight four-engined air-
craft to be used in international service.
The remainder of the loan amounting to about
one-seventh of the total, will assist in the continu-
ing development of electric power and of manu-
facturing industries. It Wlll be used to buy
equipment for iron and steel production, food
processing, chemical production, textile process-
in , mining, metallurgy, metal working and
fa ricating, and to buy specialized electrical
equi ment.
T is is the third loan made by the bank to assist
in ﬁnancing the development of Australia. A
loan of $100 million, made in August 1950, has
been completely disbursed. Three-ﬁfths of the
second loan, for $50 million, made in July 1952,
has been disbursed. The loan of March 2 will
help cover Australian imports of capital equip-
ment through September 1955.
The loan 1s for a term of 15 years and bears in-
terest at the rate of 4% percent per annum, includ-
ing the 1 percent commission which will be allo-
cated to the bank’s special reserve. Amortization
will begin in March 1957.
After having been approved by the bank’s execu-
tive directors, the loan agreement was signed by
the Australian Chargé d’Aﬂ‘aires ad interim in
Washington on behalf of the Commonwealth of
Australia and by Robert L. Garner, vice president,
on behalf of the International Bank.
