mon, extendin from Canada throu h the North
Atlantic into urope and the bor ers of Asia.
Also, our NATO allies today have ground forces
larger in size than our own. The six divisions of
American troops which we have contributed to
NATO are now standing beside approximately 90
active and reserve divisions from allied countries.
We propose to program additional military equip-
niiant to strengthen forces being created by our
a ies.
While these forces are signiﬁcant, they repre-
sent only the nucleus of our combined defensive
and deterrent strength. They must be su ple-
mented by all the other means needed to eter
attack. As one means to this end, we propose in
this pro am that the United States contribute
to this 0 jective by assisting the United Kingdom
to develop a more modern and more powerful air
force to augment NA'ro’s limited ground forces.
The NATO system is an essential element in
American policy. It represents both the keystone
of European defense and the political framework
for harmonizing allied policies and programs.
The N ATO Ministerial Council, which meets re -
ularly twice a year, assures indispensable consul
tation on an authoritative basis.
I am pleased to say that the amount of new
authorization required for our contribution to
NA'ro’s defensive strength next year will be much
less than in the past.
Consideration of NATO progress requires con-
sideration of the present status of the European
Defense Community. NATO needs a German con-
tribution in order to develop a forward strategy.
It also needs a F ranco-German unity which will
end for all time the danger of friction and strife
between these two nations. The French proposed
to gain these ends by uniting six continental na-
tions, including France and Germany, to create
a new community whose armed forces, drawn
from each member nation, would, in Europe, re-
place national forces.
It has now been more than 2 years since the
treaty to create the E00 was signed. Since I
visited Europe last year to stress the importance
which this Government attaches to Enc, consider-
able progress has been made. Four of the six
signatory nations have now ratiﬁed the treaty.
Today, only France and Italy have not taken
parliamentary action.
These delays contribute a negative factor from
the standpoint of the free world. Not only have
they delayed a German military contribution to
Western defense, but they have also prevented
West Germany from joining the family of sov-
ereign nations. This is because the treaties to
restore sovereignty to the West German Republic
are by their terms contingent on Enc’s coming into
force. There is, of course, a duly elected West
German Government, but it is not yet a sovereign
government.
It is obvious that the present situation cannot
continue much longer. There exists a conjunction
of circumstances which will not indeﬁnitely per-
sist and which when changed might make it im-
possible to achieve the vital goal of bindin
together those European nations whose past di -
ferences have led to wars of evergrowing inten-
sity. We have made it clear to our European
allies that failure to approve and implement Enc
would necessitate a thorough reexamination of
American policies. It cannot now be said what
the results of that reexamination would be. It
can, however, safely be predicted that it would
necessitate some basic changes and that certain
attitudes and policies on our part, which seem to
be taken for granted by certain of our allies,
would have to be reviewed.
In this connection, the Congress last year ear-
marked a substantial portion of the Mutual
Security funds for E00. I understand that the
Congress may wish to consider similar action this
year. Since our present policies are based on the
assumption that Enc will become a reality, there
can be no reasonable objection to such action. The
recent vote of the Socialist Congress in France is
quite encouraging and could give additional force
to our assumption that Eoo will succeed. At the
same time, I recommend to the Congress that the
Mutual Security legislation be modiﬁed in such a
way as to permit those countries which have al-
ready approved the EDC treaty to continue their
military buildup pending ﬁnal action by the other
signatory governments.
During the past year our collective security
system has been strengthened by a base agreement
with Spain.2 This arrangement will enlarge the
facilities available to the United States air and
naval craft in the western Mediterranean area.
The successful conclusion of these negotiations
represents a signiﬁcant addition to our overall
security.
The increase in the economic well-being of our
European allies during the current year is an en-
couraging development. Generally speaking,
their living standards have risen, their currencies
are stronger, and the people feel a greater conﬁ-
dence in their future. This program is unques-
tionably built on the foundation of our past pro-
grams of economic assistance. It is also due in
considerable measure to the adoption, this year, of
the “long haul” concept for NATO.
By the use of methods of greater selectivity and
by increased dependence upon new strategy, it will
be possible to maintain a steady increase of defen-
sive capability without military costs which our
European allies could not carry without great
economic help from the United States.
