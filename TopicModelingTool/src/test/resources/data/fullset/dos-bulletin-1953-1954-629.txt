Moreover, in the hearings when they take place
on the measure and on POSSible declassiﬁcation of
data regarding industrial utilization of atomic
energy, we will be prepared to answer satisfacto-
rily any uestions about the impairment of the
security of information. I would not be here to-
night if I felt that America’s participation in the
International Atomic Energy Agency need en-
danger any secrets vital to our national defense.
Prospects for Many Applleetlons
It has been less than 12 years since the power of
the atom was harnessed within a nuclear reactor.
In that brief interval, the achievements in peace-
ful uses of its energy have been varied and im-
ortant. Here in the United States these results
have come along steadily and in increasing num-
bers despite our necessary concentration on mili-
tary applications in behalf of our own defense and
the defense of the free world.
There is no need here to inventory in detail the
multiple applications of atomic energy which we
have already found in the areas of medicine, bi-
ology agriculture, and industry. We need only to
note that, notwithstanding, the surface has barely
been scratched. Progress has also been made in
other countries where the imaginations of men
have been ﬁred by the problems and the possi-
bilities.
I do wish to emphasize a less widely known
aspect of atomic progress—the advances in new
fundamental knowledge. We have seen almost a
dozen new elements isolated, identiﬁed, and ﬁtted
into the periodic table. In this still young art, we
have witnessed the conﬁrmation of the principle
of breeding atomic fuel. Successful application
of this principle will greatly extend the use of the
normal uranium which would be contributed to the
International Atomic Energy Agency.
Such advances in fundamental knowledge will
be one of the high urposes of the new atomic
agency. It is no risliz extrapolation from what
we now know to prop esy that in time—whether
it be a few years or a. decade or a generation—
there will come discoveries to enrich the lives of
all of as fully as important as those we have
already witnessed.
Atomle Energy as a Source of Power
Near the end of his speech, the President said,
“A special purpose [of the International Atomic
Energy Agency] would be to provide abundant
electrical energy in the power-starved areas of the
world.” There has been a very substantial recent
develo ment in this area. I would recall to you
th_at_w1thin the last year the Atomic Energy Com-
missmn in testimony before congressional commit-
tees felt it necessary to discount the possibility
that, under foreseeable conditions, there was any
prospect for the large-scale investment of private
capital in the develo ment of nuclear power until
the Commission ha demonstrated its economic
feasibility.
Today, less than one year since that statement,
we have had nine proposals from large companies
and grou s of companies to undertake to build and
operate tiie ﬁrst large civilian power plant. It has
been awarded to one, the Duquesne Light Company
of Pittsburgh, whose roposal will save the Gov-
ernment some $30 mi ion of the cost of its con-
struction and operations. Other companies also
see the ossibility of getting in on the develop-
ment of) nuclear power even at this early and
economically undemonstrated sta e, and other
projects are under discussion with t em.
This is an important milestone in the short life
history of atomic energy. Competent engineers
say that fossil fuel reserves, at least those that
constitute presently available sources of su ply,
are rapidly dwindling. In Europe and elsew ere,
nuclear power is now envisaged as the most prom-
ising energy source for the future.
Here, then, lies one ready opportunity for the
proposed new atomic energy agency.
To me, the kind of thinking that would be stimu-
lated by the mobilization of scientiﬁc and engineer-
ing minds, which should result from the operation
of the world bank of atomic materials, would be
unlimited since it is geared to man’s imagination
and his resourcefulness.
A Hopeful l-‘Irst Step
For the ﬁrst time since the discovery of ﬁre, we
have come into possession of a force with which
we can enrich our lives incalculably or, failing to
make that choice, we can wreck a large part of
what we have inherited from the accumulated art,
heart, and spirit of the generations that preceded
US.
In an effort to temper optimism, yet preserve the
eat faith that the President’s lan deserves, I
ave mentioned its immediate limitations. It will
not be within its scope to cure the ills of the world
with a single stroke, and it does not pretend to
insure against future war. It would be unfortu-
nate if it were represented as other than what it
is, for that is so very much—an understandable,
reasonable, feasible, constructive, and hopeful ﬁrst
step toward making atomic energy the servant of
man.
My old chief, former President of the United.
States Herbert Hoover, to whose Quaker convic-
tions the possibilities of warfare are so funda-
mentally revolting, after listening to President
Eisenhower’s s eech, said, “I pray it may be ac-
cepted by all t e world.” We may well join our
prayers to his to ask that Divine Providence guide
the hearts and minds of all men of all nations to
grasp this 0 portunity to “shake off the inertia,
imposed by ear, and . make positive prog-
ress toward peace.”
