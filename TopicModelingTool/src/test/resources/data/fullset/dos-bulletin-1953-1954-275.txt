bill passed at the same session of the Turkish
Grand National Assembly provides for the ex-
ploration of Turke ’s prospective petroleum re-
sources by private orelgn oil companies on con-
cession terms more favorable than those offered
by many other countries. Legislative action of
this type demonstrates clearly that the trend of
the Turkish economy is in the direction of private
ownership and increasing competition. This
/trend in the long run should result in increased
efﬁciency, a more balanced pattern of economic
growth and an improvement in Turkey’s foreign-
exchange position which is temporarily but -
cidedly on the deﬁcit side of the ledger.
The chief motivating reasons behind the moves
to attract private foreign capital are quite clear
especially to the Turks. The country is engaged
in an economic development pro am which must,
if it is to be kept moving at its resent livel
pace, obtain a considerable amount 0 private ca 1-
tal and technical know-how from a road. T e
Turks are aware that private capital available in
the world market today is not unlimited and that
in order to get their share of it they will have to
shop in the same private capital markets as the
Canadians, the South Africans, the Latin Ameri-
cans, and many others. As a result they must be
prepared to be a high bidder. They know that
they will have to knock at a lot of doors and that
they will have to present more than their good
intentions and a few ofﬁcial documents contain-
ing legislative assurances.
They know too that the mere assurance that
they are actively working to correct certain self-
recognized deﬁciencies is not enough. The long-
run soundness of Turkey must be demonstrated
and on this point they have supreme conﬁdence.
They not only point with justiﬁable pride to their
demonstrated accomplishments of the last 3 years,
but emphasize their future probabilities and
possibilities.
Their ride of accomplishment in recent years
is derived), in part, from the following: since 1950
they have moved from a net importer of grain
to an exporter of 1.5 million tons in 1953 and a

The new law also allows the Ministry of Finance to
guarantee approved foreign loans up to an aggregate
amount of 1 billion Turkish liras ($357 million at ofﬁcial
rate of exchange). Investments made since August 1951
are automatically covered by the new law.
As under the previous law, foreign investments must
be approved by a Government-appointed committee be-
fore being eligible for the provisions of the inVestment
law.

lished as No. 514 (January 1954) of the World Trade

probable exporter of over 2 million tons in 1954;
"during the past 5 years they have tripled the na-
tion’s mileage of all-weather highways and have
lowered internal highway transportation costs by
more than 60 percent; they have pushed three
items—grain, cotton, and nonferrous metals—
above their traditional foreign exchange leader,
tobacco; and with the assistance of the Interna-
tional Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
they developed an industrial development bank
which has, in a period of less than 3 short years,
channeled substantial amounts of domestic savings
into private industrial development schemes which
will increase domestic production of consumers’
goods and thereby reduce demands for foreign
imports in these ﬁelds; they have made modest
progress in their effort to meet internationally
recomized standards and grades for their export
prodhcts; and they have achieved broad distribu-
tion of their rapidly increasing national produc-
tion which is a factor of no little im ortance in
creating a growing market for both omestically
produced and imported consumers’ goods.
Turkish hopes are high for the successful de-
velopment of a petroleum industry within her bor-
ders, and even a modest realization of these hopes
would result in a signiﬁcant change in the coun-
try‘s import pattern, since over half of Turkey’s
dollar earnings are now being used for etroleum
purchases. Although the rise in pro action of
agricultural commodities has been more spectacu-
lar than the increases in production of nonferrous
metals, the latter is impressive from its volume
standpoint as well as from its capacity to com-
mand scarce forei n currencies, especially dol-
lars. A number 0 developments now underway
or nearing completion in the ﬁelds of mining,
power transportation, agriculture, and industr
should provide the Turklsh economy with muc
additional strength and should contribute sig-
niﬁcantly to the relief of short-term debt prob—
lems of the type now taxing Turkish ﬁnances al-
most to the limit.
The Turks realize that an early judgment by
outside businessmen of Turkey’s ability to co e
satisfactorily with the important roblem of its
short-term credit arreara es will e made since
proof of this ability1 coul be established within
6 months provided t at proper measures for doing
so were instituted promptly and implemented
vigorously. It shou d be noted, in assing, that
Turkey’s long-term funded foreign ebt has been
kept at an easily manageable level in terms of
the country’s present level of foreign-exchange
earnings.
Despite the serious problems which confront
the Turks in this period of drastic chan e and
rapid development, the Turkish economy as al-
ready produced unexpected achievements, and the
long-run prospects for its increased strength and
continued growth appear bright.
