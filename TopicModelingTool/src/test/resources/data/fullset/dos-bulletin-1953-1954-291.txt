atomic wea ns and limited application of atomic
energy in civilian and military ﬁelds, are incon-
sistent with the nuclear realities of 1954. F ur-
thermore these restrictions impede the proper ex-
ploitation of nuclear energy for the beneﬁt of the
American people and of our friends throughout
the free world.
An objective assessment of these varied factors
leads clearly to these conclusions: In respect to
defense considerations, our atomic effectiveness
will be increased if certain limited information
on the use of atomic wea ons can be imparted
more readily to nations allied with us in com-
mon defense. In respect to peaceful ap lica-
tions of atomic ener , these can be developed
more rapidly and their beneﬁts more widely real-
ized through broadened cooperation with friendly
nations and through greater participation by
American industry. By enhancing our military
effectiveness, we strengthen our efforts to deter
aggression; by enlarging opportunities for peace—
time developlment, we accelerate our own progress
and strengt en the free world.
Section 1 of the Atomic Energ Act of 1946
wisely reco izes the need for future revisions of
the law. 11 its spirit and in consideration of
matters of the utmost importance to the Nation’s
defense and welfare, I recommend that the Con-
gress _ap rove a number of amendments to the
tomic nergy Act.
Cooperetlen Wlth Other Netlene
In this atomic era, the rowth of interna-
tional cooperation for the efense of the free
world is the most heartening development on the
world political scene. The United States is allied
with many friends in measures to deter aggres-
Sion and, where necessary, to defeat the aggressor.
The agreements binding ourselves and our friends
in common defense constitute a warning to any
potential aggressor that his unishment will be
swift and his defeat inevitab e. These powerful
inﬂuences for peace must be made as strong and
convincing as possible.
Most of our friends among the nations have had
little opportunity to inform themselves on the
employment of atomic weapons. Under present
law we cannot give them tactical information es-
sential to their effective participation with us in
combined military operations and planning, and
to their own defense a ainst atomic attack.
_ Our own security wil increase as our allies gain
information concerning the use of and the defense
against atomic weapons. Some of our allies, in
fact, are now producin ﬁssionable materials or
weapons, supporting e ective atomic energy re-
search, and developing peacetime uses for atomic
power. But all of them should become better
informed in the problems of atomic warfare and,
therefore, better prepared to meet the contin-
gency of such warfare. In order for the free
world to be an effective defense unit, it must be
geared to the atomic facts of this era.
I urge, therefore, that authority be provided to
exchange with nations articipating in defensive
arrangements with the nited States such tactical
information as is essential to the development of
defense plans and to the training of ersonnel for
atomic warfare. Amendments to t e deﬁnition
of “restricted data,” recommended later in this
message, will also contribute to needed adminis-
trative flexibility in the excha. e of information
with such nations concerning t e use of atomic
weapons.
To meet a speciﬁc defense need existing in 1951,
the Congress approved a carefully limited pro-
cedure for the communication of information on
the rocessing of atomic raw materials, reactor
deve opment, production of ﬁssionable materials,
and related research and development. These
limitations should now be modiﬁed so that the
authority to communicate information, adjusted
to present conditions, may be better used to our
national advantage.
In the development of aceful uses for atomic
energy, additional amen ents are required for
effective United States cooperation with friendly
nations. Such cooperation requires the exchange
of certain “restricted data” on the industrial
applications of atomic energy and also the release
0 ﬁssionable materials in amounts aduluate for
industrial and research use. I therefore recom-
mend that the Atomic Energy Act be amended
to authorize such cooperation. Such amendments
should prescribe that, before the conclusion of
any arrangements for the transfer of ﬁssionable
material to a foreign nation, assurances must be
rovided against its use by the recipient nation
or military purposes.
Sharing certain information with other nations
involves risks that must be weighed, in each in-
stance, against the net advantages to the United
States. 11 each case we must be guided by such
considerations as the sensitivity and importance
of the data; the speciﬁc uses to which the infor-
mation will be put; the security standards of the
cooperating nation; its role in the common defense
of the free world; and the contributions it has
made and can make to the mutual security eﬁ'ort.
Such considerations apply to the exchan or com-
munication of information on genera defense
planning and the em loyment of conventional
weapons as well as to t e information that could
be exchanged pursuant to these recommendations.
These recommendations are apart from my pro-
posal to seek a new basis for international coop-
eration in the ﬁeld of atomic energy, as outlined
in my address before the General Assembly of the
United Nations last December.2 Consideration
of additional legislation which may be needed to
implement that proposal should await the de-
