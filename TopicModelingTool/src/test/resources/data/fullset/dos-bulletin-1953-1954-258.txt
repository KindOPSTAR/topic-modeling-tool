, will obliterate that division in
refer caused the division of Europe. That is one
of these strange reversals of history, the upside-
down talks, to which unfortunately we have had
to accommodate ourselves. Everyone knows that
the division of Europe was created before the ac-
tion to which I refer and that our action was taken
only because of the division of Euro e.
It cannot, I think, be forgotten t at when the
United States proposed the Marshall plan, which
involved the contributions of many billions of
dollars to the rehabilitation of Euro e, that plan
was initially made available to all of t 0 European
States. It was at that juncture that the Soviet
satellites, under the direction of the Soviet Union,
were not permitted to share in that plan. Per-
haps if that plan had been carried out in its orig-
inal scope, it would have revented the division
of Europe, or at least mit1 ated the division of
Euro e, which unfortunate y was intensiﬁed by
the oviet action.
The division of Euro e, I am afraid, comes
from causes which consi erably antedate the or-
ganization of the North Atlantic Treaty and the
proposed European Defense Community. It goes
ack to the date when the Soviet control initially
conﬁned to the Soviet Union itself, was extended
to a vast area which now includes one-third of
the human race.
I recall the pacts of mutual assistance which the
Soviet Union made in 1939 with Estonia Latvia,
and Lithuania which the Soviet Foreign Minister
at the time described in langua which is almost
exactly the same as the secon preamble of the
prfiplosed new European treaty.
e pacts with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania,
Mr. Molotov said on October 31, 1939, “strictly
stipulate the inviolability of the sovereignty of
signatory states and the principle of non-inter-
ference in each others aﬂ'alrs.”
The second preamble to which I refer speaks of
the “respect for the independence and sovereignty
of states and non-interference in their internal
aﬁairs.”
What quickly happened to Estonia, Latvia, and
Lithuania has gone on and on and has, I suggest,
created the division to which the Soviet F orei
Minister refers. It is a division between those w 0
have been absorbed and the others who do not
want to be absorbed.
Whether or not the Soviet roposal of today
urope is, as I say,
something which is primarily to be considered by
other states than the United States.
So far as the United States is concerned, we are
determined that we will not be absorbed.
SOVIET PROPOSALS OF FEBRUARY 10
Draft General European Treaty
With a view to safeguarding peace and security and
preventing aggression against any state in Europe, with
a view to strengthening international cooperation in con-
formity with the principles of respect for the independence
and sovereignty of states and of noninterference in their
internal affairs,
Seeking to prevent the formation of groups of Euro-
pean states directed against other European states, which
gives rise to friction and strained relations among nations,
and to achieve concerted action by all European states
in safeguarding collective security in Europe,
The states of which guided by the purposes and prin-
ciples of the United Nations Charter, shall conclude a
general European treaty on collective security in Europe
containing the following basic provisions:
1. The treaty shall be open to all European states
without regard as to their social systems, which recognize
the purposes and assume the obligations arising out of
the treaty.
Pending the establishment of a united, paciﬁc, demo-
cratic German state, the German Democratic Republic
and the German Federal Republic can be parties to the
treaty enjoying equal rights. It is understood that after
the uniﬁcation of Germany the united German state can
become a party to the treaty on the general terms.
The conclusion of the treaty on collective security in
Europe shall not impair the jurisdiction of the Four
Powers—the USSR, the USA, the United Kingdom and
France—in regard to the German problem which is to be
settled in the manner previously determined by the Four
Powers.
2. The parties to the treaty undertake to refrain from
any attacks against one another and also to refrain from
having recourse to the threat or the use of force in their
international relations and, in accordance with the United
Nations Charter, to settle by peaceful means and in such
a way as not to endanger international peace and security
in Europe any dispute that may arise among themselves.
3. The parties to the treaty shall consult among them-
selves whenever, in the view of any one of them, there
shall arise the danger of an armed attack in Europe
against any one or more of the parties to the treaty,
in order to take eﬁective steps to remove the danger and
to maintain security in Europe.
4. An armed attack in Europe against any one or more
of the parties to the treaty by any state or group of
states shall be considered an attack against all the parties.
In case of such attack, each one of the parties, in the
exercise of the right of individual or collective self-de-
fense, shall assist the state or states which had been
so attacked by all the means at its disposal, including the
use of armed force, for the purpose of re-establishing
and maintaining international peace and security in
Europe.
5. The parties undertake jointly to discuss and deter-
mine at an early date the procedure under which assist-
ance, including military assistance, shall be rendered by
the parties to the treaty in case there should arise in
Europe a situation requiring a collective effort for the
re-establishment and maintenance of peace in Europe.
6. The parties shall immediately send to the Security
Council of the United Nations, in conformity with the
provisions of the United Nations Charter, information
concerning the activities undertaken or in contemplation
in the exercise of the right of self-defense or for the
purpose of maintaining peace and security in Europe.
7. The parties undertake not to take part in any coali-
tion or alliance or conclude any agreement the purposes
of which would contradict the purposes of the treaty on
purpose of maintaining peace and security in Europe.
8. For the purpose of holding the consultations among
the parties provided for by the treaty and of considering
the matters arising out of the problem of safeguarding
security in Europe, the following shall be provided for:
(A) The holding of periodical and, whenever required,
of special conferences at which each of the states shall
be represented by a member of the government or by
some other specially designated representative;
(B) The establishment of a permanent consultative
political committee whose task shall be the drafting of
