The United States and a Divided China
by Alfred leSem Jenki/ns
Until the Chinese mainland came under Com-
munist domination in 1949, the United States
had en'oyed more than a centur and a half of
friend ip with the Chinese peop e, during which
our contacts with China—commercial, cultural,
religious, and political—were extenswe. Our
record in standing for the political inde endence
and territorial integrity of China is a we l-known
one, and the Second World War found our two
peoples comrades-in-arms against the imperialis-
tic power of that period which sou ht to destroy
us. The subsequent subjugation o the Chinese
mainland to the alien domination of yet another
imperialism is not only a cause of dee re at
to us because it has severed our traditiona ly c ose
relations with the vast ma'ority of the Chinese
people; it is also a cause 0 the greatest concern
to us, in that a hostile and aggressive China, in
collusion with the Soviet Union and its European
satellites, vastly enhances the threat of Commu-
nist imperialism to our own peace and security
and to that of the entire free world.
The oft-confessed objective of Communist im-
erialism is nothing less than world domination.
he Soviet leaders must be well aware that this
can never be accomplished with any semblance
of legitimacy. Not one national group of the
800 million souls now under Communist rule has
ever voted itself into communism. The free world
has shown a perverse disinclination to be “liber-
ated” from its free institutions and way of life.
Communist successes for the ast 37 years have
been the result of following fenin’s exhortation
to resort to ever form of ruses, dodges, tricks,
cunning, unlaw 1 methods, concealments and
veilin s of the truth.” Communist tactics have
inclu ed, in various combinations, inﬁltration,
subversion and sabotage, “united fronts” with
other arties while control of army and police is
secur , artition of countries which cannot at
the time e won in toto, and, when the time seems
ripe, coups d’etat or civil war. Communist con-
uest has by no means, therefore, been conﬁned
to bald military ag ession, although this more
conventional methoxflof imperialistic aggrandize-
ment has not been spurned when the odds ap-
cared to be overwhelmingly in the Communists’
avor.
This attern of Communist conquest has be-
come sic eningly familiar since World War II.
Its methodology, insidious, resilient, and multi-
form as it is, is not easy to combat, but it can be
done. The rapid growth of Communist parties
in Western Europe immediately after the war
has at least been stopped in its tracks. Western
Europe, alarmed and awakened chieﬂy by the fate
of Poland and Czechoslovakia, demonstrated its
determination to regain its strength promptly and
to remain vigilant. Communist imperialism
thwarted in the West by European acceptance of
the Marshall lan, the creation of NATO, and the
rospect of a uropean Defense Community, and
in the South by the failure of its designs against
Greece, Turkey, and Iran, turned its attention
to the East, where the ﬁrst of the three great
Asian prizes had all but dropped into its lap.
What the Communlste Went In Aela
Both the world Communist conspiracy and So-
viet imperialism, to the de ee that the two may
be distinguished, want of As1a three things. First,
communism needs the man ower of China which
constitutes one-fourth of t e world’s total p0 u-
lation. This it now has, except for the rec
Chinese on Formosa. Second, it needs the indus-
trial capacit of Japan. This was the ultimate
goal in its il -fated Korean adventure. Third, it
needs the surplus food and rich mineral resources
of Southeast Asia. Presently threatened Indo-
china is the gateway to this wealth and contains
a good portion of it. This characterization of the
three great Asian prizes eyed by Communist im-
perialism is something of an oversimpliﬁcation, of
course. China, for instance, brin s to the Com-
munist fold a good deal more t an just man-
power, valuable as that is and freely as it was
squandered in Korea. The important thing to
remember is that the Communist rulers have every
intention of using their ﬁrst great Asian rize
as the primary means of attaining the secon and
third. And the Chinese Communists, for their
