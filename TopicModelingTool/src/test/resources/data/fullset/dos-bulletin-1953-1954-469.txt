These ﬁve countries have not permitted the ship-
ment of any arms, ammunition, implements of
war, or atomic energy materials to the Soviet bloc.
Following is a summary of the less strategic but
nevertheless important shipments which the have
permitted and which have not been covered y any
previous Presidential determination with respect
to these countries. (All of these shipments went
to Eastern Europe, none to Communist China.)
Denmark
On October 21, 1953, a Danish shipbuilding
company delivered to the U.S.S.R. the second of
two tankers which were included in a Danish-
Russian trade agreement signed in Jul 1948.
The second tanker is valued at $2,181,64 . The
commitment to ship the two tankers was made
three and a half years before January 24, 1952, the
date when the Battle Act embargo lists (including
tankers) ﬁrst went into effect. Thus the two ves-
sels have been a part of the “prior commitment”
problem, one of the most difﬁcult roblems that
as arisen in the administration of t e Battle Act.
The ﬁrst tanker was delivered to Russia on July
7, 1952, and a Presidential determination to con-
tinue aid to Denmark was reported to the Congress
on July 25, 1952.
A contract with a Danish ﬁrm to build the sec-
ond tanker was signed in November 1950, for de-
livery in the fourth quarter of 1953. At the same
time the Danish government issued an uncondi-
tional export license to the shipbuilding ﬁrm. The
Danish Jovernment takes the position that there
was no legal or contractual authorit for revok-
in the license and that a default wou d have been
a reach of both international and private obliga-
tions. The U.S.S.R. has met all its obligations
under the trade a eement, and the tanker itself
was almost comp etely paid for in advance of
delivery.
As in the case of the ﬁrst tanker, the United
States Government sought through high-level rep-
resentations to persuade the Danish government
not to permit delivery of the second vessel. The
United States took the position that considerations
of national security must override other considera-
tions when there is a clear and present danger to
the very survival of free nations. The government
of Denmark, while recognizing the strategic im-
portance of the tanker and the changed world con-
ditions since the signing of the agreement, con-
tinued to hold the position that it was bound to
meet its commitments.
Now that the tanker has been delivered despite
the efforts of the United States Government, we
are faced squarely with the question whether the
termination of aid to Denmark would be detri-
mental to the security of the United States and
the free world. This problem has been thoroughly
considered by all interested agencies of the Gov-
ernment. The conclusion is that the cessation of
aid at this time would weaken the defensive posi-
tion of the free world and that it would indeed
be detrimental to U. S. security.
Following are some of the considerations taken
into account in arriving at this conclusion:
Denmark, des ite a strong element of neutral-
ism in the popu ation, is a member of the North
Atlantic Treat Organization. An effective com-
bat force in enmark is necessary not only to
Danish security but also to the effective defense of
the \Vest in the event of aggression. Greenland
the world’s largest island and an integral part of
the Danish nation, is strategically located for the
defense of North America, and continued Danish-
U. S. cooperation for the defense of Greenland is
essential to the security of the United States. Eco-
nomic aid from the United States to Denmark has
dwindled to negli 'ble amounts, but military aid
to Denmark is making an important contribution
to the common defense. The Danish forces have
been almost entirely dependent upon U. S. military
aid for initial equipment and maintenance and
without this aid Denmark could not meet its obli-
ations in NATO. The cancellation of the unde-
ﬁvered portion of this rogram would jeopardize
any further military uildup in Denmark and
weaken the effectiveness of the forces now in being,
and would seriously impair Denmark’s coopera-
tion in NATO. It would also have an impact on
Danish foreign olic . At the present time Den-
mark operates a ighlyy effective system of controls
over the shipment of strategic materials, including
controls over the transshipment of goods passing
through Danish territory.
In addition to the tanker, Denmark has per-
mitted the shipment of $696 worth of subminia-
ture tubes for hearing aids. These tubes were sup-
plied to Poland as re lacement parts for hearing-
aid devices which a anish ﬁrm had previously
sold in that country.
France
Ball bearings valued at $76,972, of types and
sizes listed as embargo items under the Battle Act,
have been recently shipped from France to Poland.
These hearings were part of a trade a eement
signed in October 1952, providing for t e move-
ment of about $18.8 million worth of various com-
modities from France and about $20 million worth
of various commodities from Poland. The French
also have shipped some more of their backlog of
rior-commitment items, $57,095 worth of miscel-
aneous machinery, valves and cocks. These also
went to Poland. Besides these prior-commitment
items, $1 494 worth of spare parts (for materials
reviously supplied) were shipped to Poland and
ungary. _
