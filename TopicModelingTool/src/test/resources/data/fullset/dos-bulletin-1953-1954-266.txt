of the Greek Government on September 21. The
situation along the northern frontiers had become
normalized to such an extent that, on November
26, Ambassador Kyrou requested the Secretary-
General of the United Nations to consider reduc-
ing the number of United Nations observers in
Greece from six to three and to continue their
services through July 31, 1954; the budget re-
quirement was estimated at $49,000. 1‘
On October 12 the United States and Greece
si ned an agreement providing for joint use
0 Greek air and naval bases within the frame-
work of the North Atlantic Treaty. 1‘ Two weeks
later, on October 26, the Soviet Union rotested
to the Greek Government, char 'ng it wit partici-
pation in the alleged NATO p ans for the prepa-
ration “of a new war” by making Greece “a
foreign military base, contrary to the interests
of maintaining peace and international security.”
The Soviet Government therefore, could not/—
but draw the attention 0! the Greek Government to the
fact that the conversion of the territory of Greece into
a base for the armed forces of the aggressive North At-
lantic Bloc creates a threat to peace and security in the
Balkans, and the Greek Government thereby assumes
grave responsibility for this step leading to an aggrava-
tion of the international situation.
The Bulgarian Government ﬁled a similar protest
on October 29, and the Albanian Government sent
one to the Secretary-General of the United Nations
on October 31. The Greek Government replied to
the Soviet note on November 12 indicating that
the Soviet position was quite unfounded, since the
agreement with the United States did not chan e
the situation in the Balkan re ion_ and was mere 1};
a supplement to the North At antic Treaty, whic
was used on the principles of collective security
enshrined in the charter of the United Nations.
The Greek note also stated that Greece, which was
devoted to the ideal of peace and international
cooperation, had learned through ex erience that
constant vigilance was imperative an did not per-
mit any slackening of defensive measures.
The Problem of the Turklsh Straits In 1953
During his visit to Turkey on May 25—26, 1953,
Secretary Dulles noted that the United States con-
sidered Turkey one of its “staunchest allies” and
appreciated “the share of the Turkish people in
measures to defend their great democracy.” The
American Congress and people, he said, were
aware of Turkish efforts “to strengthen a free and
independent Middle East,” and admired the “he-
roic performance” of the Turkish Brigade in
Korea. Turkish membership in Name, like that of
Greece, was welcomed, and the United States was

“happy to have this association with a nation
which has the courage and disci line re uired to
strengthen our common cause an act as a ulwark
in the defense against communism.”
The problem of the Turkish Straits, which had
been dormant since the end of the “great debate”
of October 1946,“ was raised once more with the
Turkish Government by the Soviet Union on May
30, although there was nothing essentially new in
the Soviet proposals. It was only a few days after
the visit of Secretary Dulles that Forei Minister
Molotov handed the Turkish Ambassa or in Mos-
cow a formal communication concerning the
Straits, indicating that the Soviet Government had
been considering its relations with neighboring
states and, amon other matters, the status of
Soviet-Turkish reiations.
The Soviet note referred to the denunciation
of the Soviet-Turkish treaty of December 17,
1925, and to the ensuing discussions, during which
on June 7, 1945, as a price for a new treaty of
“friendship” similar to those being made with
the states of Eastern and Southeastern Euro e,
the Soviet Union had asked for retrocession of t e
Kars-Ardahan district in eastern Anatolia. The
note also pointed out that at that time the Soviet
Union, in the interest of the “elimination of an
threat to the security of the Soviet Union whic
might come from the direction of the Straits of
the Bosphorus,” had raised the problem of the
Turkish Straits. The demands at the time had
included (1) bases in the Straits, (2) the elabora-
tion of a new convention of the Straits by the
Black Sea Powers and (3) joint defense of the
Straits by Turkey and the Soviet Union.
The Soviet Government now felt, however, that
the Turkish Government had “been unduly
grieved” in these matters, with conse uent dele-
terious effects on Soviet-Turkish relations." As
the Soviet note went on to say, the Armenian and
Georgian S.S.R.s in the interests of preserving
good neighborly relations and strengthening peace
and security in the region, had now found it pos-
sible to renounce their claims on Turkish terri-
tory. Moreover, the Soviet Government had
reviewed its policy as to the problem of the Turk-
ish Straits and “deemed it possible to ensure the
security of the Soviet Union in the area of the
Straits under conditions which would be equally
acceptable both to the Soviet Union and to Tur-
key. ’ Conse uently the Soviet Union now had
“no territoria claims against Turkey.”
The Turkish Government did not repl to the
Soviet note until July 18, since it desire to give
appropriate study to the problem. After repeat-
