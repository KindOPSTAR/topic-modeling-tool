the United Nations during the period immediately
preceding the Korean conﬂict In 1949 the Gen-
eral Assembl , apprehensive of Communist in-
tentions in K’drea, authorized its representatives
to “observe and re ort any developments which
might lead to or ot erwise involve military con-
ﬂict in Korea.”
United Nations observers were there on the fate-
ful morning of June 25, 1950, when the North Ko-
rean Communists launched their ag ession across
the 38th parallel. Within hours, t e United Na-
tions observers re orted to United Nations Head—
quarters in New ork that an act of overt and
unprovoked Communist aggression had taken
place.” They were able to supply the United Na-
tions immedlatel with accurate and unbiased in-
formation on w 0 were the aggressors, des ite
Communist attempts to at the blame on the
public of Korea and the nited States. This en-
abled an accurately informed Securit Council
gromptly to recommend supgort for the United
tates appeal to the United ations. Within 48
hours 0 the Communist invasion the ﬁrst col-
lective military action a ainst aggression in the
history of an internationa organization was under
way.
The members of the United Nations Commission
on Korea which ﬂashed the warnin to the United
Natlons were India, Australia, hina, El Sal-
vador, France, the Philippines, and Turke .
The observation grou in Korea, as in t e case
of Greece, Palestine, an Kashmir, fulﬁlled an es-
sential function. This was why the General As-
sembly, by an overwhelming vote, decided in No-
vember 1950 to establish a permanent Peace
Observation Commission. Its task would be to
send observers upon request or with the consent of
states to areas where conditions were such that
peace might be endan red. It was to be the eyes
and ears of the Unit Nations.
Work of Speclallzed Agencles
So far I have been talking about what may be
called the political side of our participation in the
United Nations. There are other equally impor-
tant and constructive aspects of our participation
in the United Nations which deserve mention be-
fore I conclude. I refer in particular to the work
of the specialized agencies. The prestige and ac-
complishments of these agencies, which our Gov-
ernment has so strongly backed from the begin-
ning, have increased. The contributions of other
governments to their support are being augmented.
We do not regard one nickel of our contribution
as charity or philanthropy. Our outlay is made
in the best interests of our own security and well-
being. Two-thirds of the people of the world

have a standard of living below what you or I
would regard as a minimum. I think we should
onder over this fact. The people of the under-
Ideveloped areas are beginmng to realize that
thin can be better for them, and the are de-
man ing improvement. The agents 0 interna-
tional communism are of course taking advantage
of their discontent and are preaching the false
doctrine that communism is a shortcut to a better
way of life.
The United States cannot stand aside from this
social ferment and let despair and ignorance play
into the hands of the Communists. It is clearly
in our interests to work with the free nations in
giving leadership to the programs of the special-
ized agencies of the United Nations in their in-
creasingly successful battle against hunger,
illiteracy, and disease—the conditions under which
the Communist virus thrives. By so doing we are
helping to expose empty Communist claims in
contrast to the tangible accom lishments of these
international programs of tee nical assistance.
In this work the United Nations and the United
States are s uarely on the same side. The
USSR, on t e other hand, until recent months
has denounced the work of the United Nations
specialized agencies such as the Food and A icul-
ture Organization, the International Labor , rgan-
ization, the World Health Organization, the
United Nations Educational, Scientiﬁc and Cul—
tural Or anization, etc., and has stood aloof from
members ip. Now, however, the USSR. is mov-
ing to join some of these organizations. This is a
kind of left-handed testimonial to the success of
the specialized a ncies in hel ing others to help
themselves. If t e U.S.S.R. emonstrates b its
actions that it will an port the principles an ob-
jectives of these b les, then their membership
will be welcome. If, however, their intentions are
to sabotage these principles and objectives, then I
can assure you that the free world will rally to de-
fend and safeguard these organizations.
That the free countries are alert to this danger
was amply demonstrated last week at the ILO Con-
ference now in session at Geneva. The delegates
of the non-Communist nations voted by large ma-
jorities to exclude Soviet and satellite worker and
employer representatives from the governing body
of the Inc on the grounds that in Communist
countries such representatives are simply spokes-
men for their governments, and not for manage-
ment and labor.
Of the various United Nations specialized agen-
cies I realize that you, as members of the medical
profession, have a particular interest in the World
Health Organization (W110). I am sure that
many of you here have taken some direct or in-
direct part in the WHO—the training of foreign
students or doctors, technical advice, or foreign
assignments for the organization. The World
Health Organization has a record of tangible ac-
