In every uestion where they have it, their deci-
sions will e sound.
N ow if increased knowledge and understanding
are necessary to promote the unity of our people,
they are equally necessary to the development of
international cooperation. At this juncture in
world affairs, ignorance of each other’s capacities,
hopes, prejudices, beliefs, and intentions can de-
stroy cooperation and breed war.
Nowhere on this planet today is there an im-
pregnable fortress, a continent or island so distant
that it can ignore all the outer world. If this is
not to be the age of atomic hysteria and horror,
we must make it the age of international under-
standing and cooperative peace. Even the most
rabid Marxist, the most ruthless worshipper of
force, will in moments of sanity admit that. In-
ternational understanding, however, like domestic
unity, depends—in lar e part—on the free, full
ﬂow of information an its balanced presentation.
But recent reports state that 75 percent of all the
people who inhabit the earth live under censor-
ship. Illiteracy affects vast numbers in many areas
of the lobe. And, of course, there are language
and on tural barriers. Understanding cannot,
under these circumstances, be easily or quickly
achieved. Into the vacuum caused by censorship
and illiteracy pours the positive and poisonous
ropaganda of the Soviets. For 24 hours each
a , it pours in.
he Communist r0 aganda machine, for in-
stance, tirelessly tel s a l the world that our free
enterprise system inevitably must collapse in mass
unemployment, industrial strife, ﬁnancial bank-
ruptcy. Time and again, Communistic pro a-
ganda has shifted and reversed its tactics. at
this one charge is ﬁrmly ﬁxed in the party line
from Marx to Malenkov.
Our United States Information Service, cooper-
ating with similar efforts by friendly nations, seeks
to combat propaganda with truth. Every dollar
we put into it, when wisely used, will repay us
dividends in the triumph of truth and the building
of understanding. But our ofﬁcial Information
Service is properly limited in purpose, as it is in
size. The mass of information of us and to us
must ﬂow through the established publicity media
of the several nations. Of all these we think ours
the best and the most eﬁicient.
Forelgn News Coverage
Yet, a stud in which, I am told, man of you
cooperated, s ows that the average daily news-
paper in the United States prints about four col~
umns a day of news stories from abroad. I do not
know whether that is too little. too much, or about
right. But I do know that in this amount of daily
space it is hard to inform the American people
a out relevant ha penings in all other countries.
Two-thirds of this foreign news was found to be
about important oﬁicial ceremonies and events in
other countries, about their internal political
crises, their foreign relations involvements, their
oﬁicial statements and pronouncements. Very
little of the news had to do with the man in the
street or with his social, educational, cultural,
civic, and reli ious life and history. Yet an un-
derstandin 0 these is indispensable to an under-
standing 0 a nation.
The same specialists who studied this question
also examined many European newspapers.
There, too, news about the average American was
scant. Those among on who have s )ent years
abroad have undoubtedly been amazed y the fre-
quency with which misleading or distorted opin-
ions of our individual and national life are ex-
pressed by citizens of other countries.
It is always disconcerting to hear foreign
friends speaklng disparaging y of the American
civilization as a collection of shiny gadgets. It
is alarming to know that we are considered so im-
mature in world politics as to be ready to provoke
a war needlessly and recklessly. It is even worse
to learn that we are often judged as power-hungry
as the men in the Kremlin.
Because of a tragic failure to understand us and
our purposes, the citizen of Western Euro fre-
quently looks upon America and the U.S. .R. as
two great power complexes, each seeking only the
most propitious moment in which to crush the
other by force. He believes also that, in the mean-
time, each seeks alliances with nations throughout
Europe with the sole purpose of usin them as
awns when the moment of crisis arrives. We
ow that we seek only peace, by cooperation
among equals. Success in this great purpose re-
quires that others likewise know this also.
As individuals we are fratluently pictured
abroad as rich, indifferent to all values other than
money, careless of the rights of others, and ig-
norant of the contributions others have made to
the progress of Western civilization.
Undoubtedly these misconceptions are partially
the result of Communist propaganda. But they
ﬂourish in the lack of comprehensive, truthful
two-way information.
Here at home we need fuller and better informa-
tion of others, if we are wisely to direct our poli-
cies toward real security. Many of us incorrectly
assume that all other countries would like to live
under a system identical or similar to ours. Some
believe that all foreigners are lazy or decadent—
that few pay taxes, that they hate us for the sole
reason that we are prosperous. We hear often
that the people of a particular nation are cow-
ardly, or have no love of country or ride in their
citizenship. Too often we think of t em as physi-
cally wea , intellectually shallow, and spiritually
defeated.
Of course, there are individuals everywhere
who ﬁt these descriptions—but it is dangerous to
us and to peace when we carelessly speak in gener-
alities of this kind, characterizing an entire
nation.
