They do not stay suspended in the air somewhere;
thely are in Austria. They occupy Austria.
' here is no arallel betwcen that and the so-
called United tates bases, which Mr. Molotov is
constantly referring to. If having foreign troops
in a country is com arable to a base system, and
is as evil as Mr. Mo otov suggests, _then why does
he insist on perpetuating that system and inﬂict-
ing‘it upon Austria?
he United States, and France, and the United
Kingdom, want the elimination of troops from
Austria. That. I would think would be in line
with what the Soviet Forei Minister professes
to be good international policy. But all of a sud-
den, he is the one who is contending for imposing
a base system upon Austria.
It is, however, not a base system if the United
States understands it, but something inﬁnitely dif-
ferent and inﬁnitely worse. There is no sovereign
state in the whole world where the United States
has an! troops except at the express invitation and
will 0 the sovereign country which asks us to be
there as a contribution to its own defense.
U.S. Rejects Subluptlon of Austria
There is really a difference, although the Soviet
Foreign Minister seems not to appreciate it, be-
tween being in a country at a freely given invita-
tion of that country, and imposing oneself on a
count forcefully, which is a form of subjuga-
tion. his the United States will have no part of,
and it will have no part of it in relation to Aus-
tria, and Austria which is subjected to the condi-
tions which the Soviet Foreign Minister proposes
would not become the free and independent Aus-
tria which all of us have solemnly promised time
after time after time.
It would be an indeﬁnitely Subjugated country
and that would be to make a mockery of all of
our romises.
T e Soviet Foreign Minister constantly uses
the word “temporary” in order to make his ro-
posals sound a little less harsh and brutal an
they are.
But “temporary” is a word which under the
conditions which are prescribed, couid more ac-
curatelv be put “indeﬁnitely.” I recall the “tem-
porary” nature of the stationing of Soviet forces
in Hungary and in Rumania. They were only
to stay there until an Austrian treaty would end
the Austria occupation. Now that an Austrian
treaty is in sight, the Soviet forces are to stay in
Austria until there is a German treaty. And no
one in the world can tell what new conditions will
be imposed if it ever seems likely that there will
be a German treaty—rather that the Soviet Union
permit the all-German free elections which are
the indispensable foundation for a German treaty.
Reference has been made to the reason for the
delay in the concluding of a treaty with Austria.
Anyone who is familiar with the record knows
that it has been repeatedly made clear to the Soviet
delegation over the past several years that the
Western allies were prepared to accept the provi-
sions of the treaty, to which we now formally
indicate agreement, and every time that that sug-
gestion has been made the Soviet Union has
thought up some other reason as to why it could
not proceed with the treaty—Yugoslavia, Trieste,
the failure to settle its bill for the dried peas.
One after the other excuse has been brou ht up.
N ow we could understand that that shab y per-
formance could be carried on at meetings of the
de uties, which had largely ceased to attract the
pa lic’s attention, because they had been going
on so many years.
But we really did not think that that perform-
ance would be repeated here at the meeting of
the four Foreign Ministers themselves, with the
e es of the world focused on what we do, and
that new excuses would be thou ht up, new
reasons given, not to conclude t e Austrian
treaty, just at the moment when it seemed to be
in our asp.
I rea ly would like to urge on the Soviet Union’s
Minister that he dro these new proposals, which
were never heard 0 before we came here a few
days ago, and allow this great humanitarian task
to be completed, redeeming our promise to give
freedom and liberation to Austria.
In conclusion, I recall that the United States
proposal stated that the United States was pre-
pared to acce t certain articles in the form pro-
posed by the oviet Union on the condition that
the four Foreign Ministers would conﬁrm their
past acceptance of article 4 and article 33, among
others.
The Soviet Foreign Minister has proposed basic
changes in both article 4 and article 33, which had
previously been accepted. I take it he refuses to
conﬁrm their acceptance as proposed b the United
States. If that is the case, that wou d involve a
rejection of the United States’ proposal, because
the United States is not pre ared itself to accept
the changes in articles 4 an 33 which have been
proposed by the Soviet Foreign Minister to im-
pose “neutralization” and contmuin occupation.
There are some other changes he as proposed
which are technical and on which I do not pro-
nounce myself, dealin only with the two major
proposals relating to t e change in the previously
accepted articles 4 and 33.
