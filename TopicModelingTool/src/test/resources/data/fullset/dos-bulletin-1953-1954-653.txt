of opinion against propaganda; sincere opinion
against pure demagoguery; digniﬁed statement of
position against an endless diatribe and perversion
of the truth.
Now, what were some of those perversions of the
truth. First, you heard the statement made by the
Soviet delegate that you have to be a millionaire
or a billionaire in the United States to own a
newspaper. Well, I don’t know what a billionaire
is. I never saw one. That’s too stratospheric in
numbers for me. But I come from the little town
of San Marino in California that has a po ulation
of 13,000 eople. We have a newspaper t iere. It
is owned by a resident of San Marino, completely
independent, and we read the newspaper—most all
the residents of San Marino read that newspaper.
He is not a subsidiary of any large organization.
He is the sole proprietor of his own business and
he prints in the paper what he thinks are the best
facts that he can get, not what he thinks the people
would like to read, but the facts. It is a small
business which is typical of thousands of small
towns in my country, and it is typical and symboli-
cal also of the way 95 percent of the busmess in
my country is done—not by large com anies but
by small companies or small individual usinesses.
The next statement was that the American press
is a monopoly, a trust run by dollar grabbing capi-
talists. I would remind my Soviet colleague once
more that we in the United States have no mo-
nopolies, except in public utilities that are strictly
regulated by the state or by the federal govern-
ment. We do not have monopolies. lVe have
anti-trust laws which prevent monopolies, whereas
in the Soviet Union they have only monopolies
and the state owns everything, almost even the
souls of the people. In the Soviet Union all in-
formation comes from government dictates.
Now, the next statement was that in the United
States our citizens are spoon-fed news and in-
formation which a few Wall Street bankers want
them to read. I am not going to dignify a state-
ment of that kind with an answer. I would only
say that the delegate from the Soviet Union can
go right out in this building to the newsstand and
for a few nickels he can purchase more different
opinions from the newsstand in this very building
than in the whole of Soviet Russia.
His next statement was that in the United States
all news is dominated by only three wire services,
the Associated Press, the United Press, and the
International News Service. Well, what’s wrong
with those services? Do they print facts or do
they print only pro aganda dictated by a totali-
tarlan regime. In Soviet Russia they have only
one wire service, Tass. I believe the representa-
tive is here. And the representative of Tass is a.
government employee, a government agent, al-
lowed into this country on a visa as a representa-
tive of the Soviet Union. And this agency par-
rots only what the Kremlin dictates.
The representative of Soviet Russia mentioned
the evil events foretold by George Orwell in his
book “1984.” I would like to advise my distin-
guished colleague from the Soviet Union that be-
fore he quotes that book again he ought to read
it, for that book is a biting satire on the black
abyss into which the Soviet Union would like to
lead all free countries.
The representative of Soviet Russia stated that
some correspondents, foreign correspondents, were
over in Russia. He either stated or implied they
had freedom to travel around, freedom to send
home the news they wanted. He mentioned Mr.
Salisbury of the New York Times. During my
lunch hour I had occasion to check with the New
York Times and they inform me that Mr. Salis-
bury does not have full freedom to report, since
everything that he writes goes through censorship,
the censorship which Mr. Lopez referred to in
his report. He does not have full freedom to
travel since many parts of the Soviet Union are
forbidden areas. If the delegate from the Soviet
Union really believes in full freedom of infor-
mation, I challenge Soviet Russia to lift its cen-
sorship on outgoing dispatches as the ﬁrst step in
this direction.
Now, Mr. Lopez was attacked in a most violent
manner and it has reminded me and my colleagues
of the equally vicious attack that the Soviet Union
made in the General Assembly against Justice
Berg of Norway and Sir Ramaswami Mudalier of
India. It is obvious that they fear the informa-
tion which these servants of the United Nations
have given us. This is the measure of their be-
lief in the subject that we are talking about.
Finally, the Soviet delegate came to his point
and unmasked his objective. What did he say?
He said abandon the freedom of information ath
which the Lopez report talks about and ta e a
new road, the Soviet road, down the path to Rus-
sian communism, the blackness of the dark ages
where men are chattels and where the government
tells the people what to think and what to say.
