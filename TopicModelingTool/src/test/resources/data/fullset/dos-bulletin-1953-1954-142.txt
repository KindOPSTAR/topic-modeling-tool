to the United States, internal ﬁnancial and eco-
nomic reforms in some countries, and multilateral
coo ration for the achievement of strong and }
sel -supporting economies.
Conduct of Forelgn Allolre
The burden of the vastly enlar d res onsibility
involved in our international a airs fa ls heavily
u )0“ the Department of State since the Secretary
0 State is the ofﬁcer responsible, under the Presi-
dent, for the development and control of all for-
eign policy and for the conduct of our relations
wnth foreign governments and international agen-
cies. Successful discharge of this broad respon-
sibility calls for wise and informed diplomatic
support to our national leaders in negotiations
carried on at the highest levels as at Bermuda
and Berlin. It requires the day-to-da represen-
tation of our national interest throu some 273
di lomatic missions and consular o ces abroad.
e also must continue to ive our ﬁrm su port to
the United Nations and 0t er internationa or an-
izations, and bear a part of the costs of t ese
organizations and their programs. A successful
administration of our foreign policy requires the
State Department to report and appraise polit-
ical, economic, and social conditions and trends
abroad; to provide foreign policy guidance to all
agencies carrying on pro ams overseas; and to
coordinate in the ﬁeld al foreign policy aspects
of overseas programs. Finally, advice must be
furnished as to the foreign policy implications of
domestic rograms.
Net bu get ex enditures for the conduct of for-
eign affairs in he ﬁscal year 1955 are estimated
at $125 million. This expenditure re resents a
decrease of $4 million from 1954, resu tin from
reduction of personnel and other costs of t e De-
partment of State including the curtailment of
civilian occupation activities in Germany.
Eoonomlo and Technlcol Development
Net bud et expenditures for economic and tech-
nical deveFopment in the ﬁscal year 1955 are esti-
mated at $1,028 million, compared with $1,555
million in the ﬁscal year 1954 and $1,960 million
in 1953.
This budget, as did the ﬁscal year 1954 budget,
reﬂects proportionately greater emphasis on pro-
grams in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. It
contemplates new appropriations for aid to very
few Euro ean countries.
In the ar East there is a need for contributions
to provide for relief in Korea and, now that hos-
tilities have been terminated, for an expanded
reconstruction program for that war-devastated
country. Funds are also recommended to maintain
the strength and security of Formosa and to sup-
port further the eﬂ'ort of our friends combating
Communist aggression in Indochina. This budget
also rovides for technical assistance and economic
deve o ment in India, Pakistan, the Philippines
and other nations of Asia to encourage continued
progress in their efforts to improve the living con-
ditions of their peo le.
With respect to t e Near East the budget pro-
vides for helping relieve the plight of Arab refu-
gees through contributions to the United Nations
refu ee agency, and for technical assistance and
supp ementary economic development in the Arab
States, Israel, and Iran.
Provision is also made in the budget for con-
tinuing the technical assistance program for Latin
America. This program which has existed for a
number of years, contributes to a reduction of
social and economic problems upon which com-
munism feeds and which hampers the development
of stable and growing economies.
Surplus Agrloulturel Commodltlee
I plan to request authority soon to use 0. art of
our accumulated surpluses of agricultura prod-
ucts to assist in strengthening the economies of
friendly countries, and otherwise to contribute to
the accomplishment of our foreign policy objec-
tives. Authority will be requested to use for this
purpose over a 23-year period up to $1 billion worth
of commodities eld b the Commodity Credit
Corporation. This bu get anticipates a request
for a su plemental appropriation of $300 million
for the seal year 1955 to reimburse that Corpora-
tion for commodities used.
This program for use of agricultural surpluses
is designed to complement our general program of
economic and technical develo ment and must be
closely coordinated with it. T e program for use
of surplus agricultural commodities involves the
use of stocks held by the Commodity Credit Cor-
oration. No additional bud et expenditures will
be required for these comm ities.
It should be emphasized in connection with this
program that it is purely temporary, predicated
upon adoption of our domestic agricultural ro-
gram which should not involve the continue ac-
cumulation of large surpluses. Special safeguards
will be provided which will uire that commodi-
ties furnished must be in a dition to amounts
which otherwise would have been imported and
must not displace the usual marketings of the
United States and friendly countries.
Foreign Informetlon
end Exchange Actlvltlee
This budget includes expenditures of $97 million
for foreign information and exchange activities,
including those functions conducted by the new
United States Information Agency. This is an in-
crease of $2 million over the expenditures for for-
eign information and exchange programs in the
ﬁscal year 1954.
