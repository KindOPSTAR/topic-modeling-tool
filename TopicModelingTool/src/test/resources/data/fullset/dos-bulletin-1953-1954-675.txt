ﬁt from past acts of Soviet Russia, it should at
least be an a preciation in advance that the
Kremlin woul consider such results to be in her
overall interests.
We hope all concerned, in their obsession over
local problems within the area, will not look
with blind eyes u on these new develo ments, as
they have within Elem the seeds of trou le greater
than they have ever known.
Let us tonight try to look beyond the claims and
counterclaims of misdeeds, border incidents, and
ropaganda of both sides ,Of the Arab-Israeli
dispute. These are in large part symptoms of the
disease. Let us look rather at what appear to be
some of its fundamentals.
Looklng at the Fundamentals
In dealing with these fundamentals I should
like to make one stipulation and one explanation.
In response to every public address on this prob-
lem, we are always confronted with the reaction:
“Someone should remind this s eaker that certain
other factors—which he faile to mention—also
exist.” The stipulation, therefore, is that I real-
ize that what I 11st here tonight will not be in itself
complete—nor could it be within the contents of
one short address. The explanation concerns the
reason why I should feel impelled to speak so
. frankly of policies or acts of other sovereign states.
M reason is that I feel the dangers in this situ-
ation are such that the American people are en-
titled to be informed of underlying facts of a
dispute which ma increasingly affect the security
of the Middle ast—and hence of our own
country.
POSSIBILITY OF EARLY PEACE TREATY
The ﬁrst fundamental I would list is that the
possibility of an early and formal peace treat
type of settlement between Israel and the Ara
States just does not exist. As the whole world so
sorely needs a solution—and the dangers of a con-
tinuation of a prolonged armistice are so eat—
one can only reach such a conclusion With the
eatest reluctance and concern. I can only give
it as a conclusion of one who has devoted the major
share of his working hours to this problem over a
considerable period of time. Many times during
that period I have challenged the validity of that
conclusion, only to be convinced again of its basic
soundness. There is no inspired formula which
can quickly erase the underlying causes for the
mutual feeling of hostility and distrust that
exists between Israel and the Arab States.
_ To reach such a conclusion does not mean los-
ing hope, but rather to establish a basic fact. The
difﬁculties in solving this issue do not lie in the
techniques of approach by outside powers—how-
ever 1mperfect they may be—but in the substance
of the roblem itself. The ﬁrst lesson is, there-
fore, c ear. All concerned should abandon a
will-of-the-wisp search for an all embracing
formula and concentrate on what can be done—
within the limits of practicability—on the sub-
stance of the matter.
Let no one doubt because of what I have just
said, that a basic olicy of the United States is to
see peaceful conditions established in the Near
East. To those Arab critics of a portion of my
recent address at Dayton 2 who say that the
United States must realize that the attainment of
better relations between Israel and the Arab
States should be abandoned as a U.S. objective,
my answer is that they may as well know now
that our countr cannot accept such a price to
earn the friendship of the Arab States, a friend-
shi which it so earnestly desires.
0 those, however, who demand immediate and
forceful action on our part to obtain peace, I ask
that they not lose si ht of the conditions which
must be fulﬁlled be ore a genuine and lasting
peace can be achieved. We all remember that at
the close of the First World War a ve neat '0b
of peacemaking was done at Versailles The
leaders of the World sat around the conference
table and gave their best thought to the drafting
of what was going to be a comprehensive peace
settlement to last for all time. The conditions for
Seace, however, were not established and the job
one at Versailles went for naught.
When we ask the Arab States to accept the ex-
istence of the State of Israel and refrain from
hostile acts toward her, it seems only fair to me
that they should have the right to know, with far
eater assurances than have ever been given them,
t e magnitude of this new State. They look upon
it as a product of expansionist Zionism which, re-
gardless of any present promise or paper treaty,
will ultimately commit aggression to expand to
suit its future needs.
UNDERSTANDING ARA." FEAR
The second fundamental I would list is, there-
fore, that this fear of the Arabs should be under-
stood and met not only by the assurances of great
powers but by Israel itself.
I again refer for convenience’s sake to In re-
cent Dayton speech. In that speech, I said srael
should see her own future in the context of a
Middle Eastern state and not as a headquarters
of worldwide groupings of peoples of a particular
religious faith w 0 must have special rights
wit in and obligations to the Israeli State. This
sentence has been interpreted by some as an intru-
sion into religious matters, improper for a gov-
ernmental ofﬁcial. The fact is that I was re-
ferring, among other things, to one of the key
reasons for the above fear of the Arabs.
