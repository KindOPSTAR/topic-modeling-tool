It is well that we have done this, for World
\Var II left in almost every corner of the earth
destruction, discontent, and the drive of new
restive forces.
Entirely outside the framework of the cold war,
tensions have arisen from the urge for national
self-expression. People in many dependent or
colonial areas want self-government or inde end-
ence. They want an improved standard of living.
They want increased respect for the dignity of the
human person and protection of fundamental
freedoms. Many want these things today, not in
some indeﬁnite tomorrow.
Moreover, Soviet aggressive policies have in-
ﬂicted new wounds while leaving old wounds to
fester. These developments growin out of the
cold war and the drive for national se f-expression
place a great strain upon the United Nations and
upon the United States and the other leaders of
the free world.
Notwithstandin these diﬂiculties, the United
Nations has alrea y demonstrated that it is a ﬂex-
ible olitical instrument with a capacity to adjust
to c anging situations, including the cold war,
not adequately foreseen at San Francisco when the
charter was framed. Its ﬂexibility is indicated in
the charter rovisions taking account of the need
for peacefu change and actively encoura 'ng the
orderly progress toward the goals set fort 1 in the
charter. A key provision, article 14, provides for
General Assembly recommendations to adjust
peacefully any situation, regardless of origin.
This article was described by the late Senator
Vandenberg as “the only way to esca e freezing
a status no and denying any escape rom errors
made in ecisions during the war and at the peace
table—denying any escape except by the very
armed revolt which we are sworn to resist.”
The United States along with other free-world
members has made a major effort to prevent the
“freezing” of the status quo. A perusal of the
broad a enda of a typical session of the General
Assemb y shows the desire on the part of the vast
majority of the members to insure the effective
use of the charter provisions on peaceful change.
The growing importance of the General Assembly
is, in fact, a reﬂection of the constant effort of the
members to cope with the problems of peaceful
adjustment.
The Korean Problem
The difficulties in the process of peaceful chan e
ﬁnd dramatic as well as painful illustration in t 0
handling of the Korean question since lVorld
‘Var II.
The Cairo Declaration of 1943 called for a free
and independent Korea. After 40 years of J apa-
nese rule, the establishment of Korea as an inde-
pendent state represented a formidable task, even
under the most favorable circumstances. But the
diﬂiculties were increased immeasurably by the
Soviet refusal to withdraw their control over
North Korea.
The Soviet Union blocked the peaceful uniﬁca-
tion of Korea throughout the protracted and
frustrating bilateral ne otiations with the United
States. The United tates then brought the
problem to the United Nations in the hope that
pro 3 could be made in fulﬁlling the promises
of t e Cairo Declaration. We took this step even
though the United Nations had not been expected
by its founders to be burdened with the problems
resultin from World War II.
The eneral Assembly rose to the occasion. It
developed a plan to achieve uniﬁcation on a fair
basis. Unfortunately, the Soviet Union ap-
proached this plan with the same ruthlessness as
it used to subvert the government of Czechoslo-
vakia in 1948. It continued its iron control over
the North Korean puppet government. The Be-
ublic of Korea, on the other hand, was estab-
lished as a free and independent overnment
under free elections observed by the nited Na-
tions. Soviet obstructionism culminated in the
Communist aggression of 1950, a clear rejection
of the principles of peaceful change.
In throwin back the Communist aggression,
the United ations has once more reestablished
conditions whereby peaceful change can be at-
tempted. A political conference on Korea is
shortly to be convened in Geneva. This will give
us a new opportunity to complete the job we
started at Cairo of reestablishing the independence
of all of Korea. In setting up this conference,
the Western Foreign Ministers at Berlin were
guided by the terms of the General Assembly
resolutions in August 1953.2 It is the type of
Korean political conference which we have been
trying to set up under article 60 of the Armistice
Agreement. At the conference, the United States
and other United Nations members with troops in
Korea will be represented. The conference in-
cludes the Soviet Union as a participant fully
bound by the conference decisions. The Chinese
Communists and the North Korean Cgmmunists
will of necessity participate since no settlement is
possible without their agreement. But they will
be there as aggressors. They are not included
among the sponsoring powers, and it is speciﬁ-
cally agreed that no question of recognition is in-
volved. Secretary-General Hammars 'old has
aptly hailed the agreement reached at erlin as
“a at step forward for the aims of the U.N.”
an “as a conference inside the U.N. orbit.”
We have thus made a new start toward negoti-
ating a peaceful settlement for Korea. The Com-
munists, faced with a strong free world position,
have once more accepted a position they ﬂatly re-
jected for months. But there is still much distance
to travel before we reach the goal of peaceful
uniﬁcation of Korea.
