fessor of chemistry, I traveled widely in 1925 visit-
in the various universities, but my conversations
With my contemporaries were by no means conﬁned
to technical subjects. For those were days of con-
siderable olitical excitement in the Weimar Re-
ublic. e ﬁrst President, Friedrich Ebert, had
Just died and the electoral campaign to choose his
successor was in full swing. I discussed with my
acquaintances quite frank y the past, present, and
future of Germany and Euro e. In the course of
such informal discussions in t e pleasant quarters
of a Weinstube or Bierlwlle I received a fairly
accurate im ression of what the peo le of Ger-
many were inking in 1925. I have tried to repeat
this experience by makin rather extensive trips
throng out Germany as Uglle States Hi h Com-
missioner, including many oﬁ-the-recon discus-
sions with small groups. In addition there are
other ways of assessing ublic opinion, by indirec-
tion so to speak, and we ave an excellent staff not
only in Bonn but in the consulates scattered
throughout Germany. Therefore I think that the
comparisons I shall make between Germany in
1925 and Germany in 1954 are based on fairly
reliable information.
First of all I am tempted to compare the attitude
of the citizens of the German Federal Republic
today toward their Government with the reactions
of the citizens of the Weimar Republic to the
democratic institutions of that time. And the dif-
ference is very great. In 1925 a considerable pro-
portion of those people with whom I talked were
either indifferent to or hostile to the principles on
which the Weimar Republic was founded. It was
not a question of being members of the opposition
party, not a matter of party politics, but a question
of fundamental loyalty to the then newly estab-
lished republican institutions. It seemed to me at
that time that the new overnmental structure of
Germany had not won t e loyal support of many
inﬂuential sections of the German people. This
was in part because of the failure of the Western
democracies to give encouragement and support
to those elements in Germany which were trying
to build a democratic government. These demo-
cratic elements were opposed by German conserva-
tive and reactionary forces who had never accepted
the military defeat of World War I as ﬁnal and
who therefore refused to break with the imperial-
istic past. Practically from the beginning of the
Weimar Re ublic, the ofﬁcial German government
found itsel competing for p0 ular support with
an opposition w ich was a siiadow system con-
sisting of antidemocratic elements whose purpose
was to achieve a nationalistic restoration and who
were unscrupulous in the choice of their means.
Those who had created the new constitution'were
rarely in full political control of the Weimar Re-
public and partly for this reason failed to educate
the people and, above all, the youth to accept and
support the democratic system of government. I
think I am not simply writing history backward
when I say that I came awa from Germany at
that time with a feeling of a ack of conﬁdence in
the ability of the \Veimar Republic to weather an
storms that might be ahead. And after a quic
trip to Germany in 1930 when the shadow of
Hitler was already on the wall, I returned in a
mood of pessimism about the future of the German
nation.
Today the situation is quite otherwise. I am
referring to something deeper and more signiﬁ-
cant than the fact that the electorate returned
Chancellor Adenauer’s own party to the lower
house of the Federal legislature with a majority
and his coalition with a two-thirds majority.
This result of last September’s election is of ma-
jor importance in assessing Germany today and
was a tribute to the effective leadershi of Chan-
cellor Adenauer and the work of his Cabinet
during the ﬁrst 4 years of the existence of the
Federal Republic. But what is even more sig-
niﬁcant is the fundamental attachment of the
German people irrespective of party to a federal-
ized republican form of government based on
democratic princi les; one manifestation was the
failure of either right radical arties or the Com-
munists to lace a single mem r in the Bundes-
tag. The erman people appear to have broken
with their undemocratic past. Conservative and
liberal elements have jointly created a democratic
constitution and all parties are 10 ally supporting
the new political system. Such 0 position as
exists today is not directed against t e principles
and structure of the new Republic but against
certain policies of the Government.
Germany Looks Toward the Future
A second major difference between 1925 and
1954 is the attitude of the Germans toward the
immediate past and their hopes for the future.
Seven ears after the end of World War I one
could ardly discuss any political problem in
Germany without becomin involved in an end-
less debate about the origins of the world war,
who had in fact won it or lost it, and the role of
the founders of the Weimar Republic in the dis-
turbances which followed on the heels of the
armistice in November 1918. The stab in the back
legend about the Liberals and the Socialists con-
fronted one at every turn. Indeed, this deep con-
cern with the immediate past led many Germans
to distrust the Weimar Republic and to hate the
democratic and socialist parties. Today, one very
rarely hears any discussions of the events of 1933
to 1945. I won’t say that there may not be groups
of former Nazis here and there who look back with
nostalgia and possibly with satisfaction to the
days when they were in power, but the results of
the last election show that the overwhelming
majority of the German people are now repudi-
ating the extremists of both the right and of the
left. In fact the leaders of the major parties in
