STATEMENT OF FEBRUARY 13
Press release 82 dated February 19
Yesterday afternoon the Soviet Foreign Minis-
ter presented us with a rather peculiar sandwich.
The top and the bottom of his remarks stressed
the necessity for the early conclusion of an Aus-
trian state treaty, which would reestablish a free
and independent Austria.s But in between the top
and bottom he inserted some poisonous proposals.
They meant that the treaty, instead of reestablish-
in a free and independent Austria, should estab-
lis 1 an Austria without freedom and without
independence.
I earnestly hope that these new proposals will
be withdrawn, so that we may in fact conclude an
Austrian state treaty at this very meeting, as
promised in 1943.
The Soviet Foreign Minister’s statement com-
pletely conﬁrms the view I expressed esterday
that if we adhere to the present draft 0 the Aus-
trian state treaty there remain only minor differ-
ences between us. As the Soviet proposals state,
that draft treaty “was in the main agreed among
the four powers in 1949.” Only ﬁve articles re-
main partial] unagreed, and I am conﬁdent that
with oodwill those articles could quickly be
agree upon. It will not take, as the Soviet Union
suggests, 3 months to reach that agreement. It
can be reached in 3 days or even less, so that we
can in fact conclude the treaty at this conference
in accordance with the proposal made yesterday
by the three Western powers.
However, the Soviet Union has now introduced
new proposals which would totally alter the situa-
tion. The would cut the heart out of the proposed
treaty an turn the clock back, not to 1949, not to
1947, not even to 1943, but to the darker earlier
period, when by Hitler’s action Austria seemed
opelessly doomed to be forever the victim of alien
occupation.
The Soviet Union roposes to continue the mili-
tary occupation of ustria “ ending the conclu-
sion of a peace treaty with ermany.”
Since the Soviet Union has rejected all proposals
for the uniﬁcation of Germany on the basis of free
elections, and by its own latest German proposal
treats the division of Germany as a semi—perma-
nent condition, the Soviet Austrian proposal would
mean an indeﬁnite occupation of Austria. By
requiring the withdrawal of all Allied troops from
Vienna, while retaining Soviet forces in the Soviet
zone, the capital of Austria would thus be left as a
defenseless island, surrounded by a sea of Russian
soldiers.
That occupation of Austria could never be ter-
minated by any action of her own. It would be
wholly within the power of the Soviet Union to
prolong the occupation forever merely by perpet-

uating the division of Germany and blocking an
all-German peace treaty.
If the Soviet proposal were adopted, it would
ervert the Austrian state treaty and require its
being rewritten from the preamble to the end.
How could we any longer in the preamble de-
scribe the treaty as being one designed to liberate
Austria and to make it a free and independent
state?
How could we any longer sti ulate by article 1
that “Austria shall be re-estab ished as a sover-
eign, independent and democratic state”?
How could we any longer declare as in article 2
that we “will res ect the independence and terri-
torial integrity 0 Austria”?
Article 33 entitled “Withdrawal of Allied
Forces,” would be obliterated and have to be re-
placed by an article entitled, “The Indeﬁnite Mil-
1tary Occupation of Austria.”
The treaty would thus become not a treaty for
the liberation of Austria, but a treaty for the sub-
jection of Austria.
Proposal for “Neutrallzatlon"
A second major and related change in the treaty
is proposed by the Soviet Union in terms of sub-
jecting Austria to “neutralization.”
A neutral status is an honorable status if it is
voluntarily chosen by a nation. Switzerland has
chosen to be neutral, and as a neutral she has
achieved an honorable place in the family of na-
tions. Under the Austrian state treaty as here-
tofore drafted, Austria would be free to choose for
itself to be a neutral state like Switzerland. Cer-
tainly the United States would fully respect its
choice in this respect, as it fully respects the com-
parable choice of the Swiss nation.
However, it is one thing for a nation to choose
to be neutral and it is another thing to have neu-
trality forcibly imposed on it by other nations as
a perpetual servitude.
A state subjected to such imposed neutralization
is not in fact a sovereign and independent state.
Such a demand makes a mockery of the language,
which the Soviet proposal retains, that “Austria
shall be reestablished as a sovereign, independent
and democratic state.”
It is diﬂicult to understand why the Soviet
Union, at this moment when an Austrian state
treaty seemed to be on the point of realization,
should now propose provisions which would basic-
ally alter the entire character of the treaty and
which would violate the Moscow declaration on
Austria of Nov. 1, 1943, whereby the three powers,
with the subsequent adhesion of France, under-
took “to see reestablished a free and independent
Austria.” If the Soviet proposal were accepted,
there would be not a free Austria but an enslaved
Austria, not an independent Austria but a subject
Austria.
