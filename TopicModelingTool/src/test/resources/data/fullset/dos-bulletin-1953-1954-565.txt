tion of the Indian subcontinent is a part of Soviet
objective.
As the Kremlin’s intentions became clear, the
United States, as you know, in cooperation with
other free nations, took far-reaching steps to meet
the threat. These security measures included the
North Atlantic Treaty and comprehensive ar-
rangements in the Paciﬁc area.
Power Vacuum In Middle East and South Aela
It has become a parent, however, that a power
vacuum exists in the Middle East and South Asia.
The countries of this region, large] lacking the
resources necessary for a strong military posture,
are also torn by other strains and stresses which
sap their stren h. Thus, we have the conﬂict
between the Ara States and Israel, the Egyptian
dispute with the United Kin dom over the Suez
region, the tension between ndia and Pakistan
over Kashmir.
In addition, in many countries of the Middle
East the economic and olitical situations have
resulted in acute interna instability.
At the same time, this wide area remains of
immense importance to us. It contains nearly a
quarter of the world’s population. It has tre-
mendous resources, including oil, many of which
are as yet untapped. It is a vital, strategic land,
sea, and air route between East and West.
If this part of the world is to live in freedom,
if it is to retain the capacity to develop its econom
to its own best interests, and if its political instl-
tutions are to mature within an independent
framework, we believe that it must have the ability
to defend itself against aggression. The threat
of aggression is ever present.
You will recall that early attempts to create a
sound military system in the area failed. Both
the idea of a Middle East Command and a Middle
East Defense Or anization came to nothing for
one 00d reason: Poth were born of initiative su -
plie by outside powers. As Secretary Dulles said
when he came back from his trip to the Middle
East last s ring, no collective securit system can
be impose from without. “It shoul be designed
and grow from within out of a sense of common
dan er and common destiny.”
ntil very recentl , time stood still as far as
defense of the Middle East was concerned, but
various hopeful signs have be un to show.
First, the Government of akistan asked the
United States for grant military aid.
This was a request which had to be taken
seriously. The Government and people of Paki-
stan are strongly anti-Communist. They have
indicated their desire to stand and be counted with
us in efforts to forestall the Kremlin’s imperialism.
In World War II, the history of the ﬁghting
forces from what is now Pakistan was a glorious
one, as was that of the troops from what is now
India.-
We were well aware, however, that the Indian
Government would dislike U.S. military aid to
Pakistan. Its objections were carefully weighed
by us. On balance, in considering them, it seemed
clear to us that the consequences of this action
feared b India would not develop. Further, we
believe t at as time passes India herself will see
that her apprehensions on the subject were not
justiﬁed.
During the lengthy debate in India while this
matter was being considered by us, it became ap-
parent that one motivation for India’s 0 osition
stemmed from fear that U.S. arms aid to akistan
would be used against India.
Thus, when the decision was made by President
Eisenhower to give military aid to Pakistan, he
made it absolutely clear in his public announce-
ment and in his letter on the subject to Prime
Minister Nehru’ that the arms we would give
could in no way be used in aggression without his
taking appropriate action immediately, in ac-
cordance with his constitutional authority.
We ﬁrmly believe that India has nothing what-
soever to be alarmed about as far as this assistance
goes. The Government of Pakistan has indicated
to us that it accepts fully the deﬁnitive provisions
limiting the end use of the aid.
Beyond this, we believe that if the military
strength of the subcontinent is increased, it will
serve to deter aggression from the outside.
New on this point we differ with the Indian
Government. It has eXpressed the opinion that
by this act the cold war is brought directly into
the subcontinent.
Very recently, in addressing the Indian House
of the People, Prime Minister Nehru said:
There are two approaches to this question of war and
peace. One is the approach of the feeling that war is
almost inevitable and therefore one must be prepared for
war. The other is that war must be avoided at all costs,
if not at all costs, at almost all costs. The two approaches
diﬂcr as everybody will see. 0! course, nobody wants
war—or very few people. And yet many people may well
say, “We do not want war but how are you going to help?
War must come and therefore we must do this and do
that."
That is a legitimate approach. And yet if you lay
stress on war coming you lose the battle for peace and
war is likely to come because your minds have succumbed
to the prospect of war coming in.
That is the danger of the situation: Not that people
want war, but many people seem to succumb to the idea
of the inevitability of war.
Again, in the past Prime Minister Nehru has
put forward the idea of a “no war” area, of which
India and presumably the neighboring countries,
and perhaps others, would be a part.
I believe the origins of this attitude are many
and it is not possible, for me at least, to say which
carry the most weight. But they seem to include
the following:
