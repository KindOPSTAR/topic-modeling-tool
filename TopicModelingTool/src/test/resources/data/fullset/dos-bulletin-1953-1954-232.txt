procurement for strata ic stoc iles, especially the
arge-scale stoc iling the nited States, might
precipitate a su ‘tantia readjustment of the tin
situation with extended afteretfects. A period of
burdensome stocks and low prices might develo
while roduction was being adjusted downwar .
The a rption of such stocks into consumption
would require a period in which production would
be less than consumption. This could lead even-
tually to a renewal of shortage and high prices
during the time required to expand capacity and
out at a ain.
ﬂicia announcements by the United States
during 1952 and early 1953 indicated that its stra-
tegic stoclgailling pro am was ap roaching com-
pletion. e nite States furt er announced
in November 1953 that the continued receipt of tin
under outstanding contracts would lead to hold-
ings by this Government approximately 40,000
tons in excess of stockpile requirements by March
1954. No decision has been made concerning the
ultimate disposition of this surplus, but the ques-
tion is under review in the hope of avoiding un-
due eﬁects on normal markets.
The market rice for tin was about 75 cents per
und beforet e invasion of South Korea in 1950.
e price subsequently rose to $2 per pound early
in 1951; stabilized during 1952 at about the $1.20
level s iﬁed in large purchase contracts which
the U. . Government made in the early part of
that year; and declined during 1953 to levels
around 80 cents per pound.
The lnternatlenal Agreement
The United Nations Conference on Tin tried to
make the agreement conform fully with the reso-
lutions of the U.N. Economic and Social Council
recommendin that chapter VI of the Habana
Charter be taEen as a general guide for appropri-
ate international commodity arrangements.
The roposed agreement contemplates a cooper-
ative e ort by the governments of producing coun-
tries and consuming countries to achieve a greater
degree of stability in the international tin situa-
tion. The stated objectives are to prevent or al-
leviate unem )loyment or other serious difﬁculties
likely to result from maladjustments between sup-
ply and demand; to prevent excessive price ﬂuc-
tuations and achieve a reasonable degree of sta-
bility of price on a basis which will secure long-
term equilibrium between supply and demand;
to insure ad uate supglies at reasonable prices at
all times; an to provi e a framework for the con-
sideration and development of measures to pro-
mote the progressively more economic production
of tin while protecting tin deposits from unneces-
sary waste or premature abandonment.
The Ceunell
An International Tin Council, having its seat
at London, would be established to administer the
provisions of the agreement. Each contracti
government would be represented in the Counci ,
participating either as a producing country or as
a consuming country, accordin to the declaration
made in its instrument of rati cation, acceptance,
or accession. The government of a consumin
country which is responsible for the internation
relations of a. dc endent territory mainly
interested in the p uction of tin could declare
the separate articipation of such territory on
that basis. The provisions of the agreement
would accordingly apply to that government
separate] in respect of its metropolitan territory
and the ependent territory.
The Council would select an independent non-
voting chairman who had not been actively en—
gaged in the tin industry during the 10 years
preceding his appointment. The agreement also
provides for the a pointment of a secretary, a
manager of the butlJer stock, and such additional
staff as the Council considered necessary. All of
these appointments would be subject to the condi-
tion that the individual employees should not
hold—or should cease to hold—any ﬁnancial inter-
est in the tin industry or the tin trade. The agree-
ment also provides that they should not seek or
receive instructions r arding their functions
from any person or aut orit except the Council
or a person acting on its beha f in accordance with
the terms of the agreement.
There would be 2,000 votes in the Council.
Delegates of roducing countries would hold
1,000 votes and) delegates of consuming countries
1,000 votes. Each delegate would hold ﬁve initial
votes and additional votes as provided in the
agreement. The additional votes of producing
countries would be distributed among them as
nearly as possible in proportion to the percentages
of their countries as listed in annex A to the agree-
ment or as published from time to time in accord-
ance with the provisions of the agreement. The
additional votes of the consuming countries would
be distributed among them as nearly as possible
in roportion to the tonnages of their countries
as isted in annex B to the agreement or as revised
subsequently in acordance with the provisions of
the agreement.
The agreement provides, however, that the in-
itial votes of each consuming country shall be re-
duced equally if more than 30 consumin countries
participate so that the total of initia votes for
all consuming countries will not exceed 150. Pro-
vision is also made that the Council shall deter-
mine for any consuming country which later
accedes to the agreement a tonnage which will
take effect as if it were listed in annex B.
As soon as possible after April 1, 1955, and
annually thereafter, the Council would review the
ﬁgures of net imports and consumption of tin for
each consuming country during the 3 preceding
calendar years. Revised tonnages for each con-
suming country would be published on the been
