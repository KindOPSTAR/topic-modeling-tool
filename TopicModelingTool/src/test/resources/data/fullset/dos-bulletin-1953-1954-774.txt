A pro osed new claims program now pending
before t e Senate would rovide beneﬁts similar
to those paid to World ar II victims under the
War Claims Act for losses and internments result-
ing from hostilities in Korea. The executive
branch of the Government has recommended ap-
proval of this program by the Congress. I now
suggest that this program be assigned by law to
the oreign Claims Settlement Commission.
There should also be assigned to this new Com-
mission the settlement of such of the claims r0-
grams as may be authorized from among t ose
recommended by the War Claims Commission in
its report made pursuant to section 8 of the War
Claims Act. That report, posing many complex
licy, legal, and administrative problems, is now
in rev1ewed by executive agencies; and recom-
men ations will soon be sent to the Congress.
By peace treaties and an international a -
ment, the United States has acquired the rig t to
utilize certain external assets and settlement funds
of several countries. A total of about $39,000,000
is available to indemnify claims of United States
nationals against the Governments of Roumania,
Hungary, Bul aria and Italy, arising out of war
damage or con scations in those countries. In ad-
dition, claims growing out of United States losses
from default on obligations and nationalization of
properties may be settled by awards from $9,000,-
000 realized from an agreement made in 1933 with
the Soviet Union, known as the Litvinov Assign-
ment. Action by the Congress is necessary before
these various funds may be assigned for settlement,
and recommendations of the executive branch in
gigs connection will be transmitted at an early
te.
In addition to the reorganizations I have de-
scribed, the reor nization lan transfers to the
Foreign Claims ettlement ommission the func-
tions of the Commissioner provided for in the
J_oint _Resolution of August 4, 1939. These func-
tions involve the receipt and administration of
claims covered by the Litvinov Assignment. The
ofﬁce of Commissioner, for which funds have never
been appro riated and which has never been ﬁlled,
is abolished).
The reorganization plan does not transfer the
War Claims Fund or the Yugoslav Claims Fund
from the Department of the Treasury, or divest
the Secretary of the Treasury of any functions
under the War Claims Act of 1948, as amended, or
under the International Claims Settlement Act of
1949, as amended. It does not limit the responsi-
bility of the Secretary of State with respect to the
conduct of foreign affairs. The reorganizations
contained in the reorganization lan will not prej-
udice any interest or potentia interest of any
claimant.
After investigation, I have found and hereby
declare that each reorganization included in the
accompanying reorganization plan is necessary to
accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth
in section 2 (a; of the Reorganization Act of 1949,
as amended. have also found and hereby declare
that it is necessary to include in the accompanying
reorganization plan, by reason of reorganizations
made thereby, provisions for the appointment and
compensation of oﬁicers speciﬁed in section 1 of the
plan. The rate of compensation ﬁxed for each of
these ofﬁcers is that which I have found to prevail
in respect of comparable oﬁicers in the executive
branch of the Government.
The statutory citation for certain functions of
the Secretary of State with respect to the Inter-
national Claims Commission which are abolished
by the reorganization plan, is the third and fourth
sentences of section 3 (c) of the International
Claims Settlement Act of 1949, 64 Stat. 13, as
amended.
It is at this time impracticable to specify the
reductions of expenditures which it is probable
will be brought about by the taking effect of the
reorganizations contained in the plan.
Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1954 provides a
single agency for the orderly completion of pres-
ent claims programs. In addition, it provides
an effective organization for the settlement of
future authorized claims programs by utilizing
the experience ained by present claims agencies.
It provides uni ed administrative direction of the
functions concerned, and it simpliﬁes the organ-
izational structure of the executive branch. I
urge that the Congress allow the reorganization
plan to become effective.
