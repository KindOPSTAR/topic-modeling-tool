33,760 prisoners of war from Koje-Do, Cheju-l)o, Yonchi-
Do, Pongam-Do and Chogu‘ri to Inchon and 838 sick and
wounded repatriates from Koje-Do to Pusan for further
transportation by rail to the exchange site. This repre
sents about thirty-ix per cent of the grand total to be
lifted. Mutually planned and agreed daily quotas have
been met with only minor problems. Heavy rains halted
transportation of prisoners of war from Inchon to the
exchange site on 13 August. Two vessels were used as
ﬂoating stockades during the night. However, trucks
began making deliveries on the 14th. Normal quotas were
being accepted the following day. Several ships have
reported instances of chanting and singing by the prison-
ers with scattered attempts to demolish partitions. All
of these demonstrations were controlled without casualty.
Auxiliary vessels continued to provide mobile logistics,
salvage, towing and additional services as required by all
aﬂoat units.
Salvage operations are continuing on the Cornhusker
Mariner aground to seaward of the Pusan Harbor baﬂles.
On 14 August salvage workers commenced securing ship
for expected typhoon “Nina”. The salvage oihcer re-
ported that he planned to cut the ship in vicinity of
frame 106 and beach stern and bow sections separately
in safe water.
The removal of the sunken dredge in Inchon Harbor
has now been given highest priority among the harbor
clearance projects in the Far East. The removal of the
dredge has been scheduled to begin about 15 September.
United Nations Command Naval auxiliary vessels and
transports provided personnel lifts and logistic support
for the United Nations Command forces in Korea.
In order to combat a natural tendency to relax after
a prolonged period of combat operations United Nations
Naval Commands have envisaged plans whereby the
morale of Naval forces may even be enhanced during
Armistice operations. These plans include additional op-
portunities for ﬂeet forces to visit ports in the western
Paciﬁc, full opportunity for maintaining upkeep and
maintenance schedules and increased opportunity for in-
dividual ship, unit, group and force training exercises.
The Far East Air Forces continued to support the
United Nations Command in Korea by conducting non-
combat operations during the period. To minimize the
possibility of air violations of the Armistice conditions,
additional controls were placed on the movement of
United Nations aircraft in areas immediately adjacent
to the Demilltarized Zone and coastal regions as well
as upon the entry and exit of aircraft into and out of
South Korea. Patrols were ﬂown immediately south of
the Demilitarized Zone as a precautionary measure.
Combat cargo aircraft of the 315th Air Division con-
tinued airlift operations betWeen Japan and Korea in
strict compliance with the terms of the Armistice. In
this task, . 558 sorties transported 9471.3 tons of cargo,
including 49.052 passengers and medical evacuees. Also
included in this total were 260 repatriated United Na-
tions prisoners of war whose physical conditions were
such as to make a trip by surface vessel inadvisable.
Air Sea Rescue Units of Far East Air Forces continued
their assigned role of search and rescue of missing aircraft
and crews, as well as aiding in the recovery of other mili-
tary and civilian personnel in distress.
Mr. C. Tyler Wood, newly appointed United Nations
Command Economic Co-ordlnator, will replace Dr. Henry
J. Tasca, former Special Representative of the President
for Korea Economic Aﬂ'airs, as Commander-in-Chlef,
United Nations Command Economic Adviser and Repre-
sentative on the Combined Economic Board on a per-
manent basis. Mr. Wood will establish his ofﬁce in Korea
where he will co-ordinate the existing aid programmes of
the United Nations Command and the United Nations
Korean Reconstruction Agency with the additional United
States economic aid to the Republic of Korea resulting
from Dr. Tasca's report to the President concerning ways
and means for strengthening the Korean economy.’
Since the beginning of the United Nations collective
action in Korea, the United Nations Command has sub-
mitted bi-weekly reports on its activities to the United
Nations. In addition, special supplementary reports were
submitted on appropriate occasions. In general, the sub-
stance of the bl-weekly United Nations Command reports
has been concerned with the conduct of the military opera-
tions in Korea. In light of the armistice in Korea, which
has brought about a reduction in the activities of the
United Nations Command, there does not appear to be the
same need for regular bl-weekly reports. However, the
United Nations Command will continue to fulﬁll its obli-
gations under the Security Council Resolution of July 7,
1950 by rendering reports from time to time as appropriate
on the activities undertaken in implementation of the Ar~
mistice Agreement.
