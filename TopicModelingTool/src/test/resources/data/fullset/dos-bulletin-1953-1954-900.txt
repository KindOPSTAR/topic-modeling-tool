coming under the deﬁnition of combat aircraft as
agreed upon by the Military Armistice Commis-
sion, followed up a suggestion once made by the
Polish Members and asked the United Nations
Command to clarify its position on the subject.
The reply reads as follows:
HEADQUARTERS
UNITED NATIONS COMMAND MILITARY ARMI-
STICE COMMISSION
April 10th; 1954
Memorandum for: Major General Mohn, Senior Swedish
Delegate, NNSC.
1. Reference is made to your recent informal request on
why the TB—17, VB—17, T—33. TV—2, TBM—3R, and P2V
are not considered combat aircraft.
2. I have been instructed to inform you that
(a) The TB-I'I and TB—26 are former World War II
bombers which have been stripped of their guns, bomb
racks, armor plate and other distinctive features of a
combat aircraft. These types of aircraft are now used
for utility and training ﬂights. That is the reason they
have been designated by the letter “T"-—for training.
(5) The VB—17, an old B-17, is also a former World
War II bomber which has been extensively modiﬁed for
personnel transport. Similar to the TB—17, it also has
been stripped of its armament. That is the reason it
ha been designated the letter “V”.
(c) The T—6 is an aircraft used extensively as a train-
ing plane for ﬂight instruction and general utility fly-
ing. It contains no armor or armament. Similarly, it
has been designated by the letter “T"—for training.
(d) The TBM and the TBM$R are former World War
II naval combat aircraft which have also been stripped
of armor and armament and are used as utility aircraft
for performing routine administrative missions and
cargo ﬂights.
(e) The P2V is a patrol bomber stripped of armor and
armament and is used in Korea as a transport aircraft.
(f) The T-33 is an aircraft designed expressly for
training purposes and is not designed to expend de-
structive ordnance. This airplane provides spaces for
instructor and student, dual control and carries no
armor. It is used for instruction and instrument
training.
(9) The TV—2 closely resembles the T-33. It, too, is
designed for training and not designed to expend de-
structive ordnance. It provides spaces for pilot and
student, has no armor and is used for instruction and
instrument training.
3. None of these World War II aircraft could be con-
verted into combat aircraft without extensive modiﬁca-
tion, and even were an attempt made to so modify them
they would be completely obsolete for combat purposes.
As you know, the TV—2, T—33, and T—6 have never been
designed for combats.
4. You will note that the characteristics listed above are
not those of United Nations combat aircraft. Accord-
ingly, they are not reported as combat aircraft.

These explanations fully conﬁrm the views held
by the Swedish and Swiss Members on this matter.
Consequently, in their opinion the introduction
into South Korea of 177 training aircraft up to
15 April 1954, as claimed by the Czechoslovak
and Polish Members, is completely irrelevant to
the observation of the Armistice Agreement.
Moreover, it is remarkable that the Czechoslovak
and Polish Members fail to mention, in this con-
nection, that during the period under review, 164
training aircraft were ﬂown out of South Korea.
The Czechoslovak and Polish Members comment
at great length on the question of disassembled
arts, dismantled parts and s are parts, overlook-
1ng the fact that nowhere in t e Armistice Agree-
ment is there put any restrictions on the introduc-
tion into Korea of such materiel. They also omit
mentioning that in this question the United Na-
tions Command side were willin to commit itself
beyond the obligations imposediy the Armistice
Agreement and that the negotiations on the matter
conducted within the Military Armistice Commis-
sion were ke t in abeyance by the Korean People’s
Army and Chinese People’s Volunteers side.
The Armistice A reement speciﬁcally provides
that combat materie which is destroyed, damaged,
worn out, or used up during the period of the
Armistice may be replaced on the basis of piece-
for-piece of the same effectiveness and the same
type. It is obvious, therefore, that combat ma-
teriel may also be repaired on the s ot by the use
of spare parts. It can be assumed t at the United
Nations Command side disposes of a considerable
amount of combat materiel the reﬁtting of which,
in as much as it is damaged or worn out during
the period of the Armistice, requires important
quantities of spare parts. The Czechoslovak and
Polish Members have produced no proof whatso-
ever to the effect that the United Nations Command
side has introduced dismantled parts of combat
materiel for assembling purposes. Their assertion
in this respect is again a gratuitous assumption
without foundation in fact. It is even surprising
that they are willing to display such ignorance
of military ordnance. No soldier in his sound
mind would infer that the United Nations Com-
mand is attempting to build up strength in the way
indicated by the Czechoslovak and Polish Mem-
ers.
The inanity of the accusations brought against
the United Nations Command side by the Czecho-
slovak and Polish Members can easily be exposed.
They charge that with spare parts introduced into
Korea the United Nations Command could assem-
ble guns and howitzers, machine guns, rocket
launchers and mortars, and in this way increase
their combat potential. Their allegation is par-
ticularly revealing with regard to machine guns
and mortars.
With regard to alleged “under-reporting” of
incoming combat materiel by the United Nations
Command, the Czechoslovak and Polish Members
have chosen a rather unfortunate example, claim-
