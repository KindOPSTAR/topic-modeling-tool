cates that we do not trust the Germans and the
elections are not sufﬁciently free. And in the
same breath he also says the elections must be so
conducted that what he calls the “nondemocratic”
elements in Germany are not going to be allowed
to vote.
I am curious to know as to how that can be ac-
complished without a supervision of the elections.
I cannot but believe that what he really has in
mind is that there must be conducted in all of
Germany the type of elections which I described
earlier, which had brought the “government” of
East Germany into power, where everybody was
compelled to put in a ballot to assure that there
would be no possibility of any “undesirable” per-
son being chosen.
We discussed at reat length the Paris and
Bonn treaties yester ay and a sin today and ex-
plained in simple words, wor s of one syllable,
that the uniﬁed Germany would have the choice
as to whether or not to adhere to those treaties.
Nevertheless, the Soviet Foreign Minister con-
tinues to make the assertion that they still would
be bound by these treaties and he insists upon his
formula which would, as he interprets it, prohibit
adoptin such treaties.
The act is that there is a compulsion on the
gvart of the Germans to align themselves with the
estern European community. It is not a com-
pulsion of law or treaty. \Ve have made that er-
fectly clear. It is a kind of compulsion w iich
draws inevitably the East Germans toward the
IVest. It is the same compulsion that has drawn
1 million East Germans to seek sanctuar in the
West, and it is that compulsion Mr. olotov
would rohibit by legal and military action, be-
cause espite what he says about wanting the
Germans to have freedom of choice, the fact is
his formula would deny them that freedom which
they seek by themselves—which are irresistible
attractions unless held back by military power.
I speak only of the compulsion of the spirit, of
the human aspirations which under the plan we
have proposed would enable the Germans freely
to seek their own future.
I, of course, will study careful]
which has been submitted by the
Minister.
But certainly on the basis of his own explana-
tion of it, I am re etfully compelled to feel that
it indicates that t e conditions attached to Ger-
man elections and the establishment of an all-Ger-
man government are such that they are calculated
to make them operative only if there is an exten-
sion of the system of the East German Republic
to all of Germany.
If that is in fact the interpretation which his
proposal seems to bear, that would indeed be a very
tragic conclusion for this conference to have to
end on, as far as Germany is concerned.
I felt, however, that after all the zigging and
zagging perhaps the Soviet Foreign Minister’s
the proposal
oviet Foreign
last words about troop withdrawal from Germany
indicated the objective to which all else had led
up—namely, the ending of any defense of West-
ern Germany; its complete exposure to the vast
forces that lie to the East.
And we must also recognize that if all Western
Germany is so exposed, that exposure also en-
dangers all of Western Europe.

[Unoﬂicial translation]
Recognizing the need to put an end to the division of
Germany and in conformity with existing four-power
agreements to implement the national reuniﬁcation of
Germany along democratic and peaceful lines, the Gov_
ernments of the Soviet Union, France, the United King-
dom, and the United States of America have come to the
following agreement:
1. The formation of a provisional all-German govern-
ment by the Parliaments of the German Democratic Re-
public and the German Federal Republic with wide
participation of democratic organizations shall be con-
sidered an urgent task.
The provisional all-German government can be set up
in place of the existing governments of Eastern and
Western Germany or, should this prove difﬁcult at present,
with these governments being maintained for a certain
period of time.
2. The principal task of the provisional all-German gov-
ernment shall he the preparation for and the holding of
all-German elections, 1. e.:
(a) To prepare a draft all-German electoral law that
would ensure a genuinely democratic character of the
all-German elections, participation in the elections of all
democratic organizations and the carrying-out of the elec-
tions under conditions of genuine freedom which would
preclude pressure upon voters by big monopolies;
(b) To verify, should they consider this to be advisable,
the existence throughout Germany of conditions necessary
for holding democratic elections and to take measures to
provide such conditions;
(0) To hold free all-German elections as a result of
which the German people, without the interference of
foreign powers. shall decide upon the social and state
structure of a democratic Germany and on the basis of
which an all-German government shall be formed.
3. The tasks of an all-German government shall also be
the following:
(a) To represent Germany during the preparation of a
peace treaty and in international organizations;
(b) To prevent the involving of Germany in coalitions
or military alliances directed against any power which
participated with its armed forces in the war against
Hitler Germany;
(c) Matters pertaining to German citizenship;
(d) To insure the freedom of activity for democratic
parties and organizations and to prevent the existence of
Fascist, militaristic, and other organizations hostile to
democracy and the cause of peace;
(e) To develop economic, trade, and cultural relations
between Eastern and Western Germany; matters pertain-
ing to transport, post and telegraph communications, free-
dom of movement of persons and goods throughout Ger-
many and other matters affecting the interests of the
German people as a whole.
4. In order to insure for the German people the right to
manage their national affairs themselves, it shall be
