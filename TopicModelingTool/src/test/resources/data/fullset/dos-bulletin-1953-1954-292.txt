velopment of areas of agreement as a result of our
discussions with other nations.
In a related area, present law prevents United
States citizens or corporations from en aging
directly or indirectly in the roduction of ssion-
able material outside the nited States, except
upon determination by the President that the pro-
posed activity will not adversely affect the com-
mon defense and security. Matters that have
arisen under this provision have been ordinary
business or commercial activities which neverthe-
less fall within the broad statutory prohibition
because they might contribute in some degree,
however minor, to foreign atomic energy pro-
grams. The President should be enabled to au-
thorize the Atomic Energy Commission to make
future determinations of this nature. This
amendment is related also to the above amend-
ment concerning the exchange of information with
other countries, as arrangements for authorized
exchanges of information with friendl foreign
governments may involve participation by Amer-
ican citizens or ﬁrms in work in foreign countries.
The pro osed amendment would ermit the
Atomic nergy Commission also to aut orize such
participation.
All of these proposed amendments should make
it clear that the authority granted must be exer-
cised only in accordance with conditions pre-
scribed b the President to protect the common de-
fense an security.
Protection of Atornlc Energy lntorrnatlon
A special category of “restricted data,” so de-
ﬁned as to include virtually all atomic energy data
of security signiﬁcance, is now established by law.
“Restricted data” are protected in the law by
special espionage provisions, provisions relating
to the control, dissemination, and declassiﬁcation
of such data, and by requirements for personnel
security clearances.
Personnel Security. The provisions of the act
relating to security clearances of personnel need
improvement in several respects. The act does
not reco ize degrees of sensitivity of “restricted
data.” e same clearance requirements apply to
any type of “restricted data,” whether it be access
by the unskilled construction laborer to “restricted
data” of only marginal security signiﬁcance, or
access by a scientist to the heart of atomic weapons
information. The Atomic Energy Commission
lacks suﬂicient latitude under present law to deter-
mine the extent of ersonnel investigation needed
for adequate security. Many costly background
investigations required by resent law are un-
necessary. The Atomic nergy Commission
should be permitted to relate the scope of investi-
gation required under the act to the signiﬁcance of
the access to “restricted data” which will be per-
mitted.
This amendment is especially pertinent to the
proposed broadening of private partici ation in
the development of atomic power. 'le such
private articipants will require access to “re-
stricted ata” on reactor technology, full investi-
gations of all their employees who will have such
access are not warranted because much of the data
involved will not have signiﬁcant security im-
ortance. Moreover, such investigations would
impede and discourage the desired participation
an would be unnecessarily costly both to govern-
ment and to industry. Where access to more sen-
sitive “restricted data” is involved, the Commis-
sion must, of course, require full investigations.
Another security clearance problem relates to
personnel of Department of Defense agencies and
to the personnel of contractors with those a ncies.
The Atomic Energy Commission may now isclose
“restricted data” to such of these personnel as have
security clearances from the Department of De-
fense. The “restricted data” so disclosed by the
Commission are thereafter protected in accord-
ance with Department of Defense security regu-
lations. And yet, contractors of the Commission
are precluded by law from granting the same per-
sonnel access to the same ‘restricted data” until
they have had Aso clearances, based on investi-
gations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation or
the Civil Service Commission.
As applications of atomic energy become. in-
creasingly widespread within the Armed Services,
the necessity increases for communication of “re-
stricted data” between Ano contractors and par-
ticipants in related Department of Defense pro-
grams. The present fact that personnel engaged
in military programs who have military clearances
must be denied access to “restricted data” by Anc
contractor personnel impedes cooperation between
the Department of Defense and the Atomic
Energy Commission in areas of mutual interest
and causes unnecessary expense in time and
money. I therefore recommend that the Atomic
Energy Commission be enabled to authorize its
contractors and licensees to afford access to “re-
stricted data” to personnel engaged in Department
of Defense rograms who need such data in their
work and wlio possess the proper military security
clearances.
T be Deﬁnition of Restricted Data. (1) A large
body of “restricted data” under present law relates
primarily to milita utilization of atomic weap-
ons. The responsibility for the control of much
of this weapons information logically should rest
with the Department of Defense rather than w1th
the Commission. Many administrative diﬁicul-
ties that are produced by a dual system of security
would be eliminated by the removal of this weapons
information from the “restricted data” category
and its subsequent protection by the Department
of Defense in the same manner and under the same
safeguards as other military secrets.
This method of handling weapons information
is not possible under present law. “Restricted
