Expansion of Domestic and Foreign Prosperity
E :vcerpts from the President's Economic Report to the Congress ‘
ROLE OF GOVERNMENT
IN ECONOMIC PROGRESS
A at op ortunity lies before the American
peo e. The nited States is in a pos1tion im-
m lately to undertake a sustained improvement
in national living standards. During \ orld War
II the needs of the military services and the con-
tributions that this Nation made to the military
etl'orts of its allies naturally took precedence over
all other claims on the economy. The years that
followed the war were devoted, in the main, to
meeting demands that had been postponed during
the conﬂict and the preceding years of depression.
The war in Korea once more assigned ﬁrst priority
to military needs. Toda , and we believe tomor-
row, this emphasis is no onger as pressing. Our
approach to a position of military preparedness
now makes it possible to turn the productive po-
tentialities of the economy increasmgly to peace-
ful purposes. This is a welcome op rtunity.
To help our people seize it, the Federa Govern-
ment must continue to meet successfully the chal-
lenging problems of economic transition from war
and inﬂation to peace and monetary stability.
The Importance of Progress
A high and sustained rate of economic growth
is necessary to the welfare, if not to the survival
of America and the free world. The United
States is now engaged, and must be for some
time to come, in an effort to build security forces
adequate to deter and to strike back at aggression.
These security-building efforts, and the parallel
eﬁorts to raise the defense potentials and the liv-
ing standards of friendly ples in other coun-
tries, are as much depen eat on our industrial

amount by which our national output is increased.
. it must be noted that economic progress in
our country is tied closely to the pro ess of the
rest of the world. The world is no es interde-
pendent economicall than politically. Just as
Americans have no c ance to enjoy security from
aggression while aggression is being committed
against other free nations, so also they cannot
make maximum progress if other nations suﬁer
economic stagnation or decline. A pro m for
promoting economic progress in America must
therefore provide for an extension and strength-
ening of economic ties with the rest of the world.
An accelerated ﬂow of goods and of capital across
national boundaries would contribute to economic
progress everywhere.
PERFORMANCE OF THE
AMERICAN ECONOMY
lnternatlonal Economic Transactions
The outstanding international development of
the past year was the achievement of a broad]
balanced pattern of trade and payments, at hig
and growmg levels of economic activity. This has
been accomplished in an environment of neral
monetary stability and diminishing contro s, both
within and among the nations of the free world.
Some countries, however, still depend in part on
United States military expenditures abroad, as
well as_on a variety of restrictions on dollar
transactions.
There was little chan between 1952 and 1953
in the export balance 0 the United States, when
military grant-in-aid shipments are included with
exports and military expenditures abroad are
