relatively select cup with speciﬁc purposes in
mind, and this se ectivity and purpose by its very
nature may skew the picture of American life,
motives, and attitudes which they have presented
abroad.
It is remarkable and very encouraging that
travel abroad is steadily increasing. During the
ﬁrst half of 1953, 269,918 passports were issued,
as compared with 145,516 for the similar eriod
in 1952. It was estimated that internationa trav-
elers last year would total about 600,000. One
reason for the increase is the speedup in transpor-
tation, enablin people with only a few days or
weeks to trave fairly far in the time at their
disposal. This should lead in turn to more group
rates—and lower rates. The net effect should be
to broaden the type and range of American trav-
elers and thus show a more representative cross
section of our people to our friends overseas.
The mere increase of such travel, however, will
not in itself im rove the impression we make on
our hosts abroa nor foster that awareness of our
responsibilities as Americans which President
Eisenhower has ointed out. It is safe to assume
that increases W1 1 largely be in the tourist trade,
and the tourist, whose purpose is frequently nov-
elty-seekin or just relaxation, is least apt to
want his un curtailed by an admonition to be
“serious.” Moreover, face-to-face contact with
others is not in itself a guarantee of understand-
ing, cooperation, or friendship. On the other
hand, such contact can help a lot, and travel when
properly oriented can contribute signiﬁcantly to
the effectiveness of our working with and trading
understanding with other peoples. What then
can be done to take advantage of this unusual
source of personal contacts for the fpurpose of
resenting a full and fair }picture 0 American
ife and motives in ways w ich are appropriate
in a free society, marked not by overnmental
decrees but by rivate initiative an personal in-
dependence? a matter of fact, much is already
being done and it is possible for interested groups
to learn from the experience of others while adding
to it on their own.
American travelers constitute at ﬁrst si ht a
complex, undifferentiated ﬂow of traﬂic. hey
represent all kinds of people, from accountants
to writers; they travel abroad for various pur-
poses. Of the 395,337 who received passports
during 1952, nearly 200,000 planned to travel on
business; 29,000 sought “education”; and almost
144,000 proposed to travel for travel’s sake—to
relax, to satisfy their curiosity, to see the “cities
of many men and know their manners.” Most
of them—more than 300,000—were to visit West-
ern Europe, 43,000 Latin America, and only some
34,000 planned to visit other areas of the world.
(Trafﬁc with our nearest neighbors, Canada and
Mexico, and with some other countries, is not re-
ﬂected in these ﬁgures since passports are often
not needed.)
What Is Belng Done
During the ast few years, much has been done
to make the trips of Americans abroad more sig-
niﬁcant. To sketch some of these efforts brieﬂy,
we should distinguish, ﬁrst of all, between two
groups: (1) individual travelers and (2) those
whose trips are organized and sponsored.
Individual travelers constitute a sizeable ma-
jority of the total number. How and to what ex-
tent they prepare themselves for trips abroad de-
pends entirely u on their own initiative, tempera-
ment, and inte ligence, their awareness of the
values of foreign travel, and their interest in world
affairs. However, a growing amount of helpful
and stimulating literature is now at their disposal.
Articles in newspapers and magazines have been
increasing—articles which go beyond the tradi-
tional “travel guide” t e to suggest constructive
interests and responsililh conduct while abroad.
Typical of the trend is Leland Stowe’s “The Knack
of ntelligent Travel” which a peared originally
in the Reader’s Digest and wlilch has been re-
printed in at least one travel guide. Some ides
now include hints, suggestions, and downrig t ex-
hortations along the same line. Notable among
them is the 3-volume New World Guides which,
in addition to the usual data, contains a chapter
on the Organization of American States.
There are also several pamphlets which place
particular stress upon the need for a special sense
of responsibility on the part of Americans while
travehng abroad. One which has been issued
by Pan American World Airways is entitled How
to Win Friends and Inﬂuence People in Latin
America. Another issued by the International
Information Administration (now the United
States Information A ency) is entitled Go to
Latin America with a urpose. A memorandum
on “The Tourist’s Ten Commandments” has been
circulated by the Pan American Union. Others
range beyond this hemisphere. What Should I
Know When I Travel Abroadf, published by the
Common Council for American Unity, has been
distributed widely to prospective travelers by
transportation companies and travel agencies. A
helpful booklet, Travel Abroad, has been given
wide circulation by UNESCO. The Principal theme
of much of this literature is stated succinctly in
the quotation from a congressional committee
report, which appears in the pamphlet which the
Department of State issues with every passport:
“Tourists who assume an air of arrogance or who tran-
scend the common bonds of decency in human conduct
can do more in the course of an hour to break down ele-
ments of friendly approach between peoples than the
Government can do in the course of a year in trying to
stimulate friendly relations. As we act so are we judged,
words to the contrary notwithstanding, and it is fer-
vently to be hoped that our citizen travelers will have
a growing appreciation of this fact and deport them-
selves in a manner beﬁtting their station and training."
Here, as elsewhere,what we do is more important than
what we say.
