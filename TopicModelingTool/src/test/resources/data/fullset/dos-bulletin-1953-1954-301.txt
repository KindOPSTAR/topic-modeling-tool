denly realized that it was wrong to work on the
treaty at all through deputies, and that it all had
been a great mistake that the task had been referred
to deputies for some 4 ears, and, therefore, the
whole task had to be wit drawn from the deputies
and had to be negotiated through diplomatic
channels.
New Soviet Proposals
Now, when we came here with real hope that
the Austrian State Treat?7 could at last e_ con-
cluded, we were complete y taken by surprise to
ﬁnd major new proposals put forward by the
Soviet Union.
The most serious of those proposals, because it
cuts the heart out of the treaty, is that providin
for an indeﬁnite perpetuation of armed forces 0
alien nations on the territory of the Austrian
state.
It is sug ested that the reason is, or one of the
reasons is the fact that a European Defense Com-
munit is proposed.
As recall, the E00 treaty was signed in May
1952. I do not believe that even the Soviet For-
eign Minister would claim that the treaty signed
in May 1952 explains the failure for the 3 pre-
cedin years to conclude an Austrian state treaty.
An if the European Defense Community
treaty of May 1952 was an obstacle to the removal
of Soviet troops from Austria, it is indeed sur-
prising and hardly explained why that was kept
such a close secret for 2 years, to be sprung on
us here just a day or two ago.
It was indeed a rather cruel performance, if in
fact that event of 2 years ago completely under-
mined the pro osed Austrian State Treaty that
no inkling of t at should be given during this 2-
ear period. Indeed, that is so incredible that,
1n the light of all that has transpired during the
past 9 years, we must conclude that all we are
faced by is another pretext, another excuse, for
not carrying out the solemn pledge which assured
that Austria would, as quickly as possible, be
given its independence as a sovereign state.
Function of Troops In Austria
It is not at all clear to me as to what the rela-
tionship is of Soviet troops in Austria to the
alleged reasons.
It is said that there is evidence of the develop-
ment toward an Anschluss. And presumably the
Soviet troops are to be there to prevent that.
The evidence of movement toward an Anschluss
is reported by the Soviet Foreign Minister as
being found in certain Austrian eriodicals. \Vell,
I wonder is it to be the function of the Allied
troo s in Austria to censor the publications of
the ustrians, and to be sure that nothing appears
in any7 Austrian periodicals that relates to
Anschluss?
We can only surmise as to the functions these
troops are to perform. But on the basis of the
reasons given it would seem they would have a
great role indeed in controlling the printing of the
news—perhaps the social order—of the Austrians’
supposedly sovereign state.
\Vhat are these troops to do? The Soviet For-
eign Minister says they are not occupation troops.
T icy certainly, as I said before, occu y part of
Austria. They are there to sto Ansch uss, which
it is said, is rearin its ugly ead because it is
referred to in pub ications which, presumably
then these troops would suppress.
And there is some evidence, it is said, that in
some business circles, they are thinking of economic
ties with Germany. Are these troops to have the
responsibilit of controlling the economic, the
commercial life, of Austria'. What are they to
do there to stop the Anschluss. All of that is
very obscure to me.
Another reason given, and to me that is the most
curious of all, is that the United States, it is said,
has 100 bases in Europe.
Well, let me say ﬁrst that none of those bases
is under Eno, because there is no Enc.
And furthermore, it strikes me as extremely
curious to say that because the United States has
100 bases in Europe, therefore it must be compelled
to have one more in Austria.
I think that the Soviet Foreign Minister will
understand that it is at least excusable if we think,
and if much of the world will think, that what is
actually under way here is another illustration
of the unwillin es of the Soviet Union actually
to restore genuine freedom and independence in
any area w ere it has once gotten its grip through
the use of its army or otherwise.
The interpretation is forced upon us by the
otherwise inexplicable amendments proposed and
the lack of any valid justiﬁcation for them. That
is really the tragic aspect of this affair. It throws
a somber li ht upon other problems as well.
The S0v1et Foreign Minister referred to the
question of the so-called neutralization of Aus-
tria, and indicated that I had agreed with, or was
not strongly opposed to, the SOViet position in that
respect.
I think that the Soviet Foreign Minister must
have misunderst00d me or perhaps I did not make
my position sufﬁciently clear.
What I have said, as shown by my notes, is this:
A neutral status is an honorable status it it is volun-
tarily chosen by a nation. Under the Austrian state
treaty as heretofore drafted. Austria would be free to
choose for herself to be a neutral nation. Certainly, the
United States would fully respect Austria’s choice in this
respect.
However, I went on to say that it is one thing
for a nation to choose to be neutral, and it is an-
other thing to have neutrality forcibly imposed on
it by other nations as a perpetual servitude.
