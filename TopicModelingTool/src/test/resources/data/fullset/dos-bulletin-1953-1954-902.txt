are dragging their feet on peace and intensifying
their e orts for war is a commentary upon the
eneral attitude of the Communists and gives a
is, I think, to their greatly professed love for
peace.
Asked what, in his view, was the best way to
meet a situation where the Communists were in-
tensifying war and dragging their feet on peace,
Mr. Dulles said:
The United States has made a number of sug-
gestions which all ﬁt into a common and consis-
tent pattern.
The ﬁrst suggestion of that order was, as I
have recalled to you, the proposal that the Presi-
dent made over a year ago in his April 16 address
when he proposed that there should be united
action in relation to Indochina. That suggestion
was not adopted, although, as I mentioned here,
I think, in my last press conference, it was fol-
lowed up in private negotiations by the United
States Government.‘
I renewed the same suggestion in my March 29,
1954, speech,2 and the position of the United States
with respect to that matter still stands, subject,
of course, to the possibility that a time may come
when that particular suggestion is no longer a
practical one. But it has been a practical one
ever since President Eisenhower ﬁrst made it, and
I believe it is still a practical one.
Asked whether the alternative, should the plan
for united action not become practical, might
imply the United States’ dealing with this situa-
tion singlehandedly or unilaterally, Mr. Dulles
replied:
No. The United States has no intention of
dealing with the Indochina situation unilaterally,
certainly not unless the whole nature of the
aggression should change.
“What change?” Mr. Dulles was asked. He
replied:
Well, if there should be a resumption by Com-
munist China of open armed aggression in that
area or in any other area of the Far East that
might create a new situation.
Asked how long he felt the United States and
other free nations should continue to sit at Geneva
in a sincere eﬂ'ort to negotiate while the Comm/u-
nists dragged their feet at Geneva and intensiﬁed
the war in Indochina, Mr. Dulles said:
As I pointed out earlier, the primary responsi-
bility in that respect has to be assumed by the
countries that are carrying the principal burden
of the ﬁghting in the area, which on our side are

France and Viet-Nam. They are recognized by
us as having a primacy in this matter. It would
be their decision in this respect which would be
controlling. I would not want to attempt to es-
tablish what I thought should be their policy in
this matter.
Mr. Dulles was asked what the objectives of
united action would be—would it mean interven-
tion, the holdin of a special line in Indochina,
or some other 0 jective? The Secretary replied:
It would obviously have an objective. The ob-
jective would be to retain in friendly hands as
much as (possible of the Southeast Asian penin-
sular an island area. Now the practicability
varies from time to time. What was practical a
year ago is less ractical today. The situation
has, I am afraid, een deteriorating.
Mr. Dulles was asked what pro ress had been.
made toward general acceptance 0 the united ac-
tion. idea. H e replied:
I would say that progress has been made only
in this sense, that two of the conditions precedent
have been advanced. Namely, considerable fur-
ther progress, I think, has been made in clarifying
the prospective status of the states of Viet-Nam,
Laos, and Cambodia as regards their complete
independence. And, also, the fact that on the
application of Thailand the Security Council
voted 10 to 1 to put that on its agenda, and to begin
to get into the matter. That, again, is a move-
ment on one of the fronts which we have felt to be
indispensable in relation to united action. In
those two respects some progress has been made.
The Secretary was asked about the progress of
the Washington military sta/f talks and about
parallel talks with Asian countries. He replied:
We have had a series of talks the ﬁrst of which
I think took place here in Washington with the
representatives of the Government of Thailand
with reference to their military position and steps
which might be taken to strengthen it. Then
Secretary Wilson, when he was in Manila a few
days ago, had a series of talks, himself and his
military advisers, with the representatives of the
Philippine General Staff.
The talks that are going on here in Washington
with the United Kingdom, France, Australia, and
New Zealand are the same type of talks designed to
gather together military information, to assess
military possibilities so that if and when it is nec-
essary to take political decisions there will be
available at hand the military elements of the
problem. I eXpect a further visit to this country
of the Philippine Chief of Staff and possibly a
similar visit from Thailand. We are trying to
keep in as close touch as we can with the military
