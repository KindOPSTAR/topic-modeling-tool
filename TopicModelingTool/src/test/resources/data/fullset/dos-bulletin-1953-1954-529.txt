nated world aﬁairs. They possessed a high level
of civilization, including the most advanced scien-
tiﬁc and technical skills. They possessed many
vital natural resources and the second most pro-
ductive industrial plant on earth. They exercised
ireat inﬂuence in Asia, Africa, and the Middle
ast. While these nations remained free, they
could provide ports, airbases, factories, and man-
power to deter further Soviet conquest. But if the
oviet Union could seize these nations, enslave
their peoples, and exploit their resources, it would
have gained the thin it needs most to develop an
irresistible war mac ine. By taking over free
Europe, the Soviet Union could next move into
Asia and Africa with relative ease and eventually
confront the United States with a vastly Superior
aggr ation of manpower, raw materials, indus-
trial acilities, and scientiﬁc skills, leaving us no
choice but a desperate uphill battle for survival.
Russia's Greatest Amt
During the critical months following the war,
Russia’s greatest asset was the weakness of free
Europe. Despite the great potential of the free
nations, the war had left them militaril naked,
economically paralyzed, and politically disrupted.
Most Western European armies had ceased to
exist. Even those nations which retained armies,
such as the United Kingdom, had demobilized most
of their forces. And the economic means needed
to rebuild their defenses were lacking. In fact,
the economic situation was so near colla se in
certain countries that it appeared ossible or the
Communists to take over Without ring a shot.
Millions of Europeans were homeless and hun-
The war had not only destroyed their sav-
ings and their r0 erty—their homes, schools, and
churches—but hadp also seriously damaged the very
means of recovery. Farms had been laid waste.
Factories had been bombed out. Colonial inter-
ests and overseas investments had been lost. Trade
patterns with other arts of the world had been
isrupted. Europe aced the problem of pulling
itself up by its bootstraps without any bootstraps.
Economic instability contributed to political and
psychological demoralization. Many Europeans
suffered rom a paralysis of will—from a sur-
render of hope for the future. Organized govern-
ment had ceased to exist in many countries and had
to be reestablished from bottom to top. Commu-
nist parties, having played an important role in
the resistance movements, had gained great in-
ﬂuence and respectability. These parties now
turned their attention to sabotaging all efforts at
economic recovery and subverting normal political
processes in order to pave the way for complete
Communist domination.
Many people hoped that the Soviet Union, once
it had attained reasonable security for itself, would
not try to take advantage of the weakness of its
neighbors and would instead cooperate with other
nations in an effort to achieve world stability and
prosperity. The United States provided billions
of dollars through UNRRA [United Nations Re-
lief and Rehabilitation Administration] to relieve
suffering in all arts of the world including the
Soviet orbit, andp meanwhile attempted to develop
a practical universal security system through the
United Nations. We even went so far as to pro-
pose international control of atomic energy at a
time when we alone ossessed atomic weapons.
However, hopes 0? Russian cooperation were
rapidly doomed to disappointment. The Kremlin
not only refused to give up an of the territory
its forces had seized but sought urther expansion.
A Communist civil war was launched in Greece,
supported by Soviet satellite governments across
the border. Turkey and Iran were subjected to
threats and intimidation. The Iron Curtain was
clamped down over the Soviet occupation zone in
Germany, and it soon became evident that the
Kremlin was unwilling to negotiate any peace
treaty for Germany and Austria except u on
terms which would pave the wa for comp ete
domination of those countries. ommunist ele-
ments seized control of the governments in Hun-
ar and Czechoslovakia and began a civil war
in hina which eventually drove the free Chinese
overnment from the mainland. In Western
urope, particularly France and Italy, Communist
Parties were making a stron bid for power. From
the Atlantic to the distant aciﬁc, the Communist
tide rolled forward.
In view of the alarming weaknesses of Western
Europe, it was obviously unrealistic to hope for a
reestablishment of a balance of ower system in
the traditional sense. The shieldp which had ro-
tected this country for so many generations ad
been broken and could not be repaired. No longer
could America expect a “free ride” in terms of
international security; this fact had already been
recognized during World War II. The only way
in w iich a balance of power could be restored was
by combining the strength of the United States
with that of free Europe. This required active
American partici ation in the efforts of Europe
and other parts 0 the free world to maintain their
independence and stabilize their societies.
Strengthenlng Western Europe
If Western Europe was to be converted from
an area of weakness to an area of strength, it was
evident that three ty es of measures were neces-
sary. Broadly spea ing, these were economic,
military, and olitical. It was necessary to stop
the downwar spiral of the European economy
and to lay a foundation for increased production
and improved living standards. It was necessary
to rebuild Europe’s military defenses against the
swollen Soviet armies. Finally, it was necessary
to preserve and strengthen democratic political
institutions in Europe and to encourage the Euro-
