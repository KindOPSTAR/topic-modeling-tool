Which sent armed forces to Korea to repe the
aggression. The “Uniting for Peace” Resolution,
a opted by the General Assembl in November
1950, grew out of that ex erience. yl‘hat resolution
will enable members of t e United Nations to ioin
in carrying out similar collective measures a met
any future aggression without being blocke by a
Soviet veto.
The free world system of bases is an integral
art of its collective security. At the recent Four
ower Conference in Berlin, Mr. Molotov re-
peatedly attacked these bases as evidence of aggres-
sive purpose. Actually these bases on the terri-
tory of other sovereign countries are merely a
physical expression of the collective security
system. They were constructed only at the re-
quest of the host nation and their availability de-
pends upon its consent, usually as a legal condition
and always as a practical one. The requisite
consent to the use of these bases would never be
accorded unless it was clear that their use was in
response to open aggression, and reasonably re-
lated to its scope and nature. This gives assur-
ance of their community function.
Thus the free world has practical means for
achieving collective security both through the
United Nations and the various regional arrange-
ments already referred to.
The Strategy To Deter Algrmlon
The uestion remains: How should collective
defense e organized by the free world for max-
imum protection at minimum cost? The heart
of the problem is how to deter attack. This, we
believe, reqpires that a potential aggressor be left
in no don t that he would be certain to suffer
damage outweighing any possible gains from
aggression.
his result would not be assured, even b col-
lective measures, if the free world sought to
match the potential Communist forces, man for
man and tank for tank, at every point where they
mi ht attack. The Soviet-Chinese bloc does not
lac manpower and spends it as somethin that
is cheap. If an aggressor knew he could a ways
prescribe the battle conditions that suited him and
engage us in struggles mainly involvin man-
power, aggression might be encoura e . He
would be tempted to attack in places and y means
where his manpower superiority was decisive and
where at little cost he could impose upon us great
burdens. If the free world adopted that strategy,
it could bankru t itself and not achieve security
over a sustain period.
The free world must devise a better strategy
for its defense, based on its own special assets.
Its assets include, especially, air and naval power
and atomic weapons which are now available in
a wide range, suitable not only for strategic bomb-
ing but also for extensive tactical use. The free
world must make imaginative use of the deterrent
capabilities of these new weapons and mobilities
and exploit the full potential of collective se-
curity. Pro erly used, they can produce defen-
sive power able to retaliate at once and effectively
against any aggression.
To deter ag rression, it is im ortant to have the
ﬂexibility an the facilities w ich make various
responses available. In many cases, any open
assault by Communist forces could only result
in starting a general war. But the free world
must have the means for responding effectively
on a selective basis when it chooses. It must not
put itself in the position where the only response
open to it is general war. The essential thi
is that a potential ag ressor should know in a?
vance that he can andxwill be made to suffer for
his aggression more than he can ossibly ain
by it. This calls for a system in w ich loca de-
fensive strength is reinforced by more mobile
deterrent power. The method of doing so will
vary according to the character of the various
areas.
Some areas are so vital that a special guard
should and can be put around them. \Vestern
Europe is such an area. Its industrial plant
represents so nearly the balance of industrial
power in the world that an aggressor might feel
that it was a good gamble to seize it, even at the
risk of considerable hurt to himself. In this re-
spect, \Vestern Europe is exceptional. Fortu-
nately, the West European countries have both a
military tradition and a large militar potential,
so that through a European Defense ommunity
and with support by the United States an
Britain, they can create an adequate defense of
the Continent.
Most areas within the reach of an a gressor
offer less value to him than the loss he wou d suffer
from well-conceived retaliato measures. Even
in such areas, however, local ‘defense will always
be im ortant. In every endangered area there
shoul be a sufﬁcient military establishment to
maintain order against subversion and to resist
other forms of indirect aggression and minor
satellite aggressions. This serves the indispensa-
ble need to demonstrate a purpose to resist, and
to compel any afggressor to expose his real intent
b such serious ghting as wil brand him before
all the world and promptly bring collective meas-
ures into operation. otential aggressors have
little respect for peoples who have no will to ﬁvht
for their own rotection or to make the sacri ces
needed to ma e that ﬁghting signiﬁcant. Also,
the know that such peo les do not attract allies
to ght for their cause. or all of these reasons,
local defense is important. But in such areas the
main reliance must be on the power of the free
community to retaliate with great force by mobile
means at places of its own choice.
A would-be aggressor will hesitate to commit
aggression if he knows in advance that he thereby
