U. S. AlDE-MEMOIRE OF DECEMBER 24 ‘
In its note of November 5, 1952, the Govern-
ment of the United States pointed out that the So-
viet Government, by its failure to return the 186
naval craft and other lend-lease vessels requested
by the United States, was in default of the very
agreement under which lend-lease negotiations
' Initialed by Under Secretary Smith.
have been carried on since April 1947. The SO-
viet Government was advised that it is therefore
the position of the Government of the United
States that when the Soviet Government has made
arrangements to fulﬁll its obligations under Arti-
cle V of the Lend-Lease Agreement of June 11,
1942, the Government of the United States in the
interest of a settlement, will be prepared to make
further proposals concerning a ﬁnancial settle-
ment.
The Soviet Government in its note of October
20, 1953 again stated that it has agreed to return
the 186 naval craft and also stated that it is will-
ing to discuss the technical arrangements for the
transfer of these vessels to the United States. Ac-
cordingly, the United States proposed in its note
of November 24, 1953 that representatives of the
two Governments meet on December 15, 1953 at
the Department of State to work out the details
for the return of the 186 naval craft to the United
States. His Exeellenc , the Ambassador of the
Union of Soviet Socia 1st Republics, replied by
note on December 3, stating that the Sowet Gov-
ernment was in agreement with the proposal of
the Government of the United States that repre-
sentatives of the two Governments meet on De—
cember 15.
From these exchanges of correspondence it was
the expectation of the Government of the United
States that working groups of the two Govern-
ments would meet on December 15 to work out
the details for the return of the 186 naval craft
to the United States. However, on December 14,
His Excellency advised the Acting Secretary of
State that the Soviet Government desired to deal
simultaneously with all of the issues in the lend-
lease negotiations including the return of the 186
naval craft to the United States. The Acting
Secretary replied that the Government of the
United States favored a step-by-step approach but
nevertheless undertook to consider the Soviet po-
sition. Subsequently an ofﬁcer of the Soviet Em-
bassy informed the Department that it was the
position of the Soviet Government that the meet-
ing scheduled for December 15 should be cancelled.
The Government of the United States has care-
fully considered the position of the Soviet Gov-
ernment and has concluded that the various ques-
tions should be dealt with on a step-by-step basis.
In reaching this conclusion, this Government has
been guided by its belief that adherence to the
terms of the Lend-Lease Agreement of June 11,
1942 can best contribute to the creation of the mu-
tual understanding necessary to the negotiation of
a ﬁnal lend-lease settlement agreement.
\Vith respect to the question of the 186 naval
craft, the Government of the United States has
taken into account the fact that the return of these
craft was requested initially on September 3, 1948,
more than ﬁve years ago, and that at no time were
