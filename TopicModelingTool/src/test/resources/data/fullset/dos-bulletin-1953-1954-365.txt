The Period at American Neutrellty: 1939—1941
As the war 5 read, followin the invasion of
Poland in 1939, eaving in its wage destro ed cities
and destitute people, a ﬂood of emotiona appeals
to aid the victims engulfed the American people.
The ur ency of these appeals aroused the sym-
pathy of the public, particularly among the groups
with ties of blood and sentiment with the combat-
ants. There rapidly developed hundreds of hast-
ily organized committees as country after country
became involved in the conﬂict.
This situation introduced a new factor in the
relations of the Federal Government to its citi-
zens. Controls of a regulatory character were
imposed for the ﬁrst time over various forms of
voluntary war relief. Section 8 (b) of the
Neutrality Act of November 4, 1939, required such
control. This act was designed to rotect the
neutral position of the United States by the pro-
hibition of various forms of economic relations
with countries proclaimed belligerent by the
President. These countries were Belgium, France,
Germany, Luxembourg, Norwav, the Netherlands,
Poland, and the Lnited Kingdom. Private
measures to relieve human suﬁ'ering in such coun-
tries were permitted under the act—but only under
regulation. In consequence all American volun-
tary relief agencies (except the Red Cross, which
has its own congressional charter) were required
to re 'ster with the Department of State 1f en-
ga in the solicitation and collection of funds
an contributions in kind for relief in belligerent
countries. But these requirements did not apply
to relief to the neutral countries. Nevertheless,
the public was confronted with hundreds of ap-
peals b organizations not subject to the Neutrality
Act. The resultin confusion of purpose, dupll-
cation of effort, an waste of man ower and mate-
rial resources dictated the need or coordination
and control.
This situation led Secretary Hull in a letter of
March 3, 1941, to recommend to President Roose-
velt that some authority be established to protect
the ublic from ex loitation and to assure that
the nds and supp ies were productively used to
serve the urpose for which they were collected.1
Mr. Hu 1 pointed out that the suffering caused
by the conﬂicts then raging in other parts of the
world had called forth the humanitarian efforts
of the American people; that about 300 organiza-
tions were registered with the Department of
State in order that they might solicit and collect
contributions; that many were raising funds with-
out full knowledge of the relief resources already
at hand and the actual relief uirements; that
while these efforts were inspired y the ﬁnest hu-
man instincts there was a growing danger that
the might be frustrated if they were conducted
witliout proper coordination.
Pursuant to Mr. Hull’s conclusions, President
Roosevelt appointed a special committee, consist-
ing of former Ambassador Joseph E. Davies,
Chairman, Charles P. Taft, and Frederick P. Kep-
pel,2 to examine the whole problem of foreign war
relief in relation to local charities and national
defense welfare needs and to recommend meas-
ures that should be taken in the public interest.
During this period of American neutrality the
registered voluntary agencies received $49 mil-
lion in funds and goods to the value of $12.9 mil-
lion, a total of $61.9 million, from the contribu-
tions of the public.8 It should be noted that 81
percent of the contributions came from a public
interested in the welfare of particular racial
groups, a reﬂection of the inﬂuence of blood ties
and sentiment. Thus the distribution overseas
was largely for the relief of British, French,
Dutch, Norwegian, Greek, Polish, and Palestinian
warsuﬂ'erers. The value of the voluntary exports
of the 300 registered agencies during these 3 years
of neutrality was $50.5 million,8 about 3.5 percent
of the total voluntary exports for the whole period
1939—1953.
The Period of American Partlcipatlon in the War:
1942—1945
The exercise of greater police powers, and the
establishment of a single authority with adequate
regulatory and supervisory powers, was dictated
as the country moved from a state of neutrality
to a state of war. The ﬁndings of the Davies Com-
mittee, which included a study of the successful
workings of the Canadian War Charities Act, were
approved by President Roosevelt. Executive Or-
der 9205 of July 25, 1942, was issued creating the
President’s War Relief Control Board,‘ the pred-
ecessor body to the Advisory Committee on Vol-
untary Forei Aid. It was com osed of Joseph
E. Davies C airman, Charles P. aft, and Fred-
erick P. thpel. Upon Mr. Keppel’s death in 1943
he was succeeded by Charles Warren.
The Board was empowered in furtherance of the
war effort to license and regulate any solicitation
for war-relief charities, whether domestic or for-
eign, by agencies other than the American Red
Cross or established religious bodies; to control
the timing, character, and manner of appeals to the
public; and, in the interest of economy and efﬁ-
ciency, to consolidate organizations wit 1 common
objectives.
