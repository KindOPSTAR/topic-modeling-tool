THE FOREIGN SERVICE



Effect of Security Program
on Foreign Service Personnel
Press release 24 dated January 19
At his press conference on January 19, Secretary
Dulles was asked for comment on the letter signed
6 Norman Armour Robert W'oods Bliss, Joseph
. Grew, William P 'llips, and G. Howland Shaw,
addressed to the editor of the New York Times
and printed in the Times on January 17, regard-
ing the effect of the security program on the F or-
eign Service. M r. Dulles replied as follows:
Yes, they sent me a copy of that letter. I read
it with interest. They are a distinguished group
of former di lomats whom I highly respect. As
a. matter of act, I have at times called upon one
or another of them for advice since I have been
Secreta of State.
I thi , however, that they perhaps do not have
a complete awareness of the security rocesses
which go on in the State Department. he fact
is that in all security cases there is an evaluation
by a Foreign Service ofﬁcer. In the last anal sis
no one can be or is suspended, which is the rst
step, without my personal inquiry into the matter
and my own personal check on the evaluations of
my security oﬂicers.
That has taken a large amount of my time,
probably an undue amount of my time in some
res ts. But where the reputation and ha piness
of individual human beings is involved I lieve
that I am justiﬁed in subtracting time if necessary
from affairs of State to take care of these personal
cases. And there has been no case of suspension
or proposed suspension to which I have not given
my own personal attention.
I have not always followed the recommendations
made to me about suspensions; but I would also
say that in no case have recommendations been
made to me which seem to me to be reckless or
without some basis in fact to justif the recom-
mendation. I have not always foun it adequate,
but I have ersonally reviewed every one of these
cases and there is no Foreign Service oﬁicer who
needs to live under any apprehension that there
will be any ruthless process employed so far as
he is concerned.
It is sug ested in this letter that possibly some
members 0 the Foreign Service are frightened so
that they do not report accurately or clearl . I
think the writers use the word report “amliigu-
ously.” I must say that I ﬁnd no evidence of
that at all. I ﬁnd no evidence of any cringin on
the part of the Foreign Service personnel. be-
lieve that they are performing their work ade-
quately, loyally; and doin their duty as I would
expect of the ﬁne body 0 men and women that
they are.
