Declaration of 24 October 1953 on the
Continued Application of Schedules to the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
The contracting parties to the General Agreement on
Tariﬂs and Trade (hereinafter referred to as “the Gen-
eral Agreement"),
Consrnaamo that, under the provisions of Article
XXVIII (as amended), the assured life of the concessions
embodied in the schedules annexed to the General Agree-
ment will expire on 31 December 1953, in the sense that
thereafter it will become possible for a contracting party
by negotiation with other contracting parties to modify
or cease to apply the treatment which it has agreed to
accord under Article II to any products described in its
schedule,
Cossmaamo that, although by the terms of the Agree-
ment the schedules will retain their full validity not-
withstanding the expiry of their assured life, the pos-
sibility of invocation by contracting parties of the pro-
cedure of Article XXVIII for modiﬁcation of speciﬁc
concessions would, in present circumstances, impair the
stability of tarii! rates which has been one of the prin-
cipal achievements of the General Agreement, and
Consmaame warnsa that it would be particularly un-
desirable to arrive at such a result at a time when a
number of contracting parties are studying ways and
means of making further progress in the reduction of
tariffs and other barriers to trade and towards the achieve-
ment of the other objectives of the General Agreement,
Hereby declare that they will not invoke prior to 1 July
1955, the provisions of Article XXVIII, paragraph 1, of
the General Agreement to modify or cease to apply the
treatment which they have agreed to accord under Article
II of the General Agreement to any product described in
the appropriate schedule annexed to the General Agree-
ment.
The provisions of this Declaration shall not apply to
concessions initially negotiated with a government with
respect to which this Declaration is not in eﬂect.
The Declaration shall be open for signature at Geneva
until 30 October 1953. It shall thereafter be deposited
with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who is
authorized to register this Declaration in accordance with
Article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations, and shall
be open for signature at the Headquarters of the United
Nations until 31 December 1953.
The Secretary-General oi.‘ the United Nations shall
promptly furnish a certiﬁed copy 01' this Declaration to
each Member of the United Nations, to each other govern-
ment which participated in the United Nations Confer-
ence on Trade and Employment, and to any other inter-
ested government.
In WITNESS wrmarzor the respective representatives,
duly authorized have signed the present Declaration.
Dom: at Geneva, in a single copy, in the English and
French languages, both texts authentic, this 24th day
of October, one thousand nine hundred and ﬁfty-three.
india To Receive 200,000
Tons of Steel
India’s farm-equipment manufacturers, rail-
ways, and construction industries will be the
principal consumers of 200,000 tons of steel being
provided this year under the largest single Indo-
American project negotiated as part of the U.S.
technical cooperation program for India, the For-
eign Operations Administration announced on
January 20.
The steel agreement, signed early this month in
New Delhi bv the Director of the United States
Operations Mission and the Government of India,
provides $25.5 million in US. funds to ﬁnance
the purchase of steel from free-world markets
outside of India.
The Government of India will deposit the rupee
equivalent of the controlled pool price of the steel
in a development fund to be used for further proj-
ects under the Indo-American program. It will
also meet ocean transportation and handling costs,
estimated at the equivalent of $3.15 million.
The production of food, which has a high pri-
ority in India’s 5-year plan, has been held back by
the shortage of steel and about 40,000 tons of steel
imported under the agreement will be earmarked
for agricultural and rural development uses. Dur-
ing the last 2 years, India has received $16,885,000
to import iron and steel for making farm tools
and implements as part of the food-production
program.
The remainder of the 200,000 tons of steel will
be allocated as follows: 23.5 percent to shipbuild-
ing and repairs, hospital equipment, pipes, tubes,
industrial machinery, and oil drums and contain-
ers; 43 percent to railway car building and other
railway requirements; 8.5 percent to river valley
projects; and 5 percent to small scale and cottage
industries and the petroleum industry.
Although India’s own steel industry is large, by
Asian standards, output is less than half enough
to meet the estimated annual demand. Normal
annual production is about 1 million tons, and the
annual need in 1954 is expected to reach 2.9
million.
Expansion of steel and pig iron production in
India is included in the 5-year plan and work has
already gotten underway.
Both the Tata Iron and Steel Company and
Indian Iron and Steel Company are enlarging
facilities, Tata meeting costs largely from its own
reserve funds but with some Government assist-
ance and Indian Iron and Steel with loans from
the Government and the World Bank.
In addition, the Government of India signed an
agreement in December with the German combine
of Krupps and Demag to set up a third major steel
operation. Designed to produce 500,000 tons of
steel in the ﬁrst phase, the plant will later be
expanded into a million-ton unit. If the program
is implemented according to schedule, the next 4
years will see a major addition to the industry.
Allocation of the imported supplies will be made
by the Iron and Steel Controller. India has had
steel controls in operation since World \Var II.
