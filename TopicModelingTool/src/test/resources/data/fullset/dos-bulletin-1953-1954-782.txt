rivalries and jealousies which produced the con-
ﬂa ations of 1914 and 1939.
here is another point which I would like to
emphasize. If these efforts toward greater unity
by and for Europeans bear fruit, as we all s1n-
cerely hope the will in the not too distant future,
they will provi e a solid core of economically pros-
perous, politically stable, and militarily defen-
sible cooperatin states to serve as a rallying point
and a powerfu magnet to which in time other
European nations will be drawn.
I well remember how bitterly and repetitively
Mr. Molotov at the Berlin Conference attacked
the whole concept of the European Defense
Community.‘
Soviet Fear of Unlted Europe
As I listened to Mr. Molotov I could not help
feeling that his vehemence was not motivated by
any Soviet fear that the Eve might one da turn
into an instrument of aggression against the Soviet
Union, which was his major theme. His real fear,
I thought—so real he never dared to put in into
words—was his fear of the disruptin effects on
the Soviet power system in Eastern uro e of a
prosperous, healthy, stable, free, and unite West-
ern Europe.
I saw with my own eyes at Berlin the owerful
attraction that the prosperit , the political free-
dom, and the high standar of living in West
Berlin exercise u on East Berliners. Translate
the microcosm of est Berlin into the macrocosm
of Western Europe, and I think on will see what
it was that Mr. Molotov and is Kremlin col-
leagues really fear about the prospect of a free and
united Europe.
And this brings me to the major point I would
like to make to you tonight. I have talked a good
deal about the strength of the Soviet power sys-
tem—and the threat it represents to our security.
I have referred to the progress which we, in con-
cert with our European and Atlantic allies, have
made in organizing ourselves for security against
that threat. I have said nothing at all about
Soviet vulnerabilities and sources of weakness.
And to my mind, the Soviet Union’s eatest
source of weakness, its major vulnerabillty, lies
1n precisely those formerly free and independent
e0 les in Eastern Europe whom it has so ruth-
ess y made its captives and slaves to serve its im-
perial ambitions. We must never allow ourselves
to for et that we have allies not only on this side
of the ron Curtain—we have allies behind it, too.
If we are to effectively reduce or eliminate the
Soviet threat to European security it is clear that
we must use all the resources of our diplomacy,
not only to protect the independence and promote
the unity of Western Europe but also to promote

the freedom and welfare of the captive peoples of
Eastern Europe.
That like so many things, is easier said than
done. But there are some thin we can do, and
we are doin them. Let me give you a few ex-
amples of w at we are doing.
We have in spite of considerable difficulties and
provocations maintained diplomatic relations with
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, and Rumania.
This fact does not indicate any degree of approval
of these regimes or the means whereby they were
established. Our princi a1 reason for maintaining
diplomatic missions in tliese countries is that those
missions assist us in our efforts on behalf of these
unfortunate people. Through our ofﬁcials there
we can keep some remaining ties with them in
their hour of suﬁering; all the evidence indicates
that our ﬂag ﬂying over the buildings we occupy
there is an important symbol of hope for the
population.
The maintenance of hope and the strengthening
of ties between the West and the captive peoples
are likewise vital objectives of our radio broad-
casts into the Iron Curtain areas.
In the United Nations, we have worked to expose
to the world the Soviet Communist violations of
human rights in Eastern Europe so as to bring
the force of world opinion to bear on the situation.
In our diplomatic moves on behalf of the peo~
ples behind the Iron Curtain, we do not attempt to
prescribe what shall be the way of life of these
people once they regain their freedom and inde-
pendence. To do so would be to substitute our
will for the Soviet command which has been im-
osed upon them. We must at all times be ided
y the principles laid down by President isen-
hower in his speech of April 16, 1953:
. . . Any nation’s right to a form of government and
an economic system of its own choosing ls inalienable.
. . . Any nation’s attempt to dictate to other nations
their form of government is indefensible.
For the future of this region, all we can legiti-
mately expect is that the form of government and
economic system to be established will correspond
to the freely expressed will of the people. Thus,
we feel that in such states of the future each indi-
vidual should enjoy the protection of due process
of law and the ri ht to work, to live, and worshi
in accordance wit his own conscience and belie .
We further expect that each nation will live in
peace and harmony with its neighbors. Since no
nation’s security and well-being can be lastingly
achieved in isolation, each nation should cooperate
fully with its neighbors in establishing full and
friendly exchange of ideas, persons, and goods
within an acceptable international framework.
I think we will all agree that these goals are
right and desirable. The question is: What are
the chances for achieving them? Certainly we
cannot count on sudden, spectacular success. The
course we have charted requires patience, ﬂexibil-
