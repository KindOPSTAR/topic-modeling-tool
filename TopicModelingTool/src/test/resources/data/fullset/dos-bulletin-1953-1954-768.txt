there was an inﬁrmary but that was not always the
case, and when there was one the reports over-
whelmingl y indicate that medicines, bandages, and
so forth were inadequate.
In these circumstances the death rate was high.
The most common causes were exhaustion and mal-
nutrition, exposure to extreme climatic conditions,
accidents at work, and occasional epidemics.
“Most prisoners died of dysentery, complete ex-
haustion, and colds and their aftermath,” a former
prisoner said.
A victim might or might not be able to send and
receive mail. Where allowed, it usually was
limited to one letter per month and all incomin
and outgoing letters and packages passed throug
a censor.
Refusal to work was met by severe punishment.
One victim reported:
For example, 350 prisoners struck for work closer to
their specialties, for an 8—hour day and for separation
from criminals. They starved for 15 to 40 days.
All were shot. In other cases protestors were promised
improvements, then the promises were never made good.
They were sent to the assignment ofﬁce and then to other
camps. Or they were sent to solitary. Every day there
were those who refused to work and go solitary. If an
individual refused to work, it was considered a crime. but
it was worse if they refused in a group. The individual
would get 1, 2, 3 years added to his sentence, solitary for
months, 300 grams of penal ration.
It appears, moreover, that there was little if any
relationship between particular “crimes” and par-
ticular punishments. Almost any punishment can
be meted out for almost any “crime.”
“The punishment barracks were terrible. They
were dark underground vaults, without heat, light,
or blankets. Beds were just boards. Sometimes
people were fed 300 grams of bread (dark) a day,
sometimes not,” as one man described the situation.
Frequently one of the worst features of the camp
was the group of habitual criminals known as the
“blatnois.” Descriptions of their activities indi-
cated that they plagued the other prisoners, stole
their belongings, and forced them to turn over food
under threats of violence. They fought among
themselves and sometimes murdered one of their
own number or a noncriminal prisoner. These
actilvlities of the blatnois were rarely punished, if
at a .
We have heard rumors of improvement in the
cam s occasioned by the Ad H 00 Committee’s
wor . And of course there were the so-called
amnesties. The U. S. S. R. granted one a year ago
and the “sovereign” states that constitute the
Soviet sphere of inﬂuence copied the Soviet decree
and issued it with minor adaptations. But all
these amnesties carefully avoided releasing politi-
cal prisoners.
If there has in fact been improvement of any
kind in the ofﬁcial use of forced labor, the world
is owed a statement of the situation by the coun-
tries which stand accused. If the U. S. S. R. and
its satellites have any respect for the standards
upon which the United Nations rests, the Iron
Curtain should be raised and a full and frank dis-
closure should now be made.
Despite the intensity of its labors, the Commit-
tee was not able to ﬁnish its task. Notably in the
case of Albania and Communist China, the Com-
mittee was unable to ursue its inquiry to a con-
clusion. Yet it shoul be noted that the Commit-
tee did not dismiss the allegations against the
Governments of Albania or Communist China,
as it did in a number of cases where it found no
evidence.
Evidence From Albanla
Stringent censorship has been imposed by the
Enver Hoxha government to revent the outside
world from learninﬂr about Al ania’s internal af-
fairs, including tlie forced labor conditions.
Tourists, correspondents, and other writers from
democratic countries are barred out. Albanians
are barred in—by law and by armed border
guards. Laws, decrees or administrative orders,
court proceedings, internal political events, any or
all affairs of state are printed by Albanian news-
papers only as the government sees ﬁt.
Is it any longer strange, therefore, that the Ad
H 00 Committee, in its own words could not obtain
documentation with regard to Albania?
But there are ways of etting fragmentary facts
on what is taking place in that shrouded state.
I use an Albanian newspaper to show that the
Hoxha regime is committed to a olicy of forced
labor. I quote from a report printed in the Al-
banian news aper Bashkimz' on May 23, 1952. It
is a report 0 a speech made by Bilbil Klosi Min-
ister of Justice, in presenting a new enal code
to Parliament. Here are some of his 0 cially re-
ported words: “What are the general principles
of the draft of the code? They are the principles
of the Soviet Penal Law. In the crimes against
the state complicity has still a larger meaning.
In these crimes merely the participation in an
anti-government group is considered an accom-
plished crime . . .”
Under the topic of penalties, the Minister of
Justice said:
The penalties are intended not only to punish the cul-
prits but to educate them and combat unstable ele-
ments . . . The principal penalties are death, imprison-
ment, deportation for corrective labor, corrective labOr
and public censure . . .
The testimony of 300 Albanians who ﬂed the
black tyranny of their country tells the story of
the men who have suffered under this revime.
Their story is the doleful litany recited by vir-
tually all the countless men and women and chil-
dren initiated into that bleak fraternity—Com-
munist “educative” labor. It is the harrowing
tale of the rap on the door at midnight—the accu-
sation—the inevitable sentence.
Among these histories is the account of Reshad
Agaij, a stenographer on the same newspaper
Bashlcimi during the early days of the Communist
806
