differences in opinion are naturally to be e ected.
Prior to Rio we shall work out and make own
to other governments in as great detail as circum-
stances permit the limits of our economic policy.
We hope that the other nations will do the same.
Then, at Rio, we shall see what solutions can be
found for problems falling within areas where our
respective policies are consistent. Where they are
inconsistent, any positive action will presuppose
further study. If any Latin American nation
wants high tariffs to rotect its domestic indus-
tries, we must res ect t at conviction, even though
we may feel that it is prejudicial to their interests
in the long run. By the same token, if we feel
that our best interests and theirs will be served by
a reciprocal reduction in trade barriers, they
should give our view the same respect that we give
to theirs. Each of us must concede the good faith
of the other’s opinion and his right to have it. We
cannot change the convictions of our neighbors by
quarreling.
Economic Principles Underlying Our Own Economy
What are the factors and the principles on
which we believe the strength of our economy
depends? Those which in the aggregate bear the
familiar name of the private enterprise system.
Even highly developed industrialized democracies
have had unhappy experiences with their basic
industries when they experimented with national
socialism. Russia’s extensive adventure with
collectivism has achieved only substandard living
levels, inferior merchandise and services, high pro-
duction costs, inadequate systems of transporta-
tion, and an inability to meet domestic and foreign
ﬁnancial obli ations. Theirs is an economy in
which all of t e processes of production, market-
1ng, and consumption function because of police
order and not because the personal interests of
the people engaged in them are thereby served.
States are and should be free to pursue their
destinies by the routes which they select. How-
ever I believe history will eventually record that
mankind is emerging from a period of worldwide
experiment which has demonstrated that enlight-
ened and socially conscious private enterprise
affords to mankind the greatest hope of achievin
his timeless aspirations to better his living stan -
ard and that of his fellows.
What are these principles which in the aggre-
ate comprise the private enterprise system? One
is our conviction that overnments, save in un-
usual situations, shoul stay out of business,
whether as producers, manufacturers, trans-
porters, or marketers.
No generality is always accurate, but generally
businesses operated by governments are not com-
petitive, proﬁtable, or stable. They are inher-
ently vulnerable to management policies designed
to achieve aims other than business ob'ectives.
They fail in the purpose which every usiness
must constantly pursue to survive in a system
of private enterprise, i.e. to furnish a superior
product or service and at a competitive price.
Thus we will be reluctant to participate in
programs under which governments will e age
directly or indirectl in industries into w ich
private enter rise, w ether domestic, foreign, or
mixed, is wil mg to venture.
The second principle to which we shall be stead-
fast is that the role of government should en-
erally be that of creating conditions favorablé to
private capital and private enterprise. The limits
of accomplishment for private enterprise have
been enormously expanded. Through public of-
ferings of debt and equity securities which unite
thousands of individually small investments and
widely diffuse risks, it is possible to assemble
massive capital resources for adventures of such
scope, of such long term, and of such speculative
nature that there are today but few enterprises
on which a government would be justiﬁed in em-
barking in the interests of its people on the
assum )tion that private capital would not be
availa le.
Private capital will not enter, however, except
where certain basic conditions favorable to its
success are present. Some of these conditions lie
beyond the control of governments. But others
lie within their power to grant or deny.
The more important of these conditions, of
course, include guarantees of property ri hts,
guarantees of contract rights, uarantees 0 an
opportunity to earn a reasonab e rate of return,
particular] in businesses such as public utilities
where pro ts are controlled by governments.
As regards property rights, no investor will
knowingly enter a country unless there is reason-
able certainty that the properties resulting from
the investment will not be expropriated without
the payment of prompt, adequate, and effective
compensation. In fact, no investor is likely to
invest in a countr if he has reason to believe that
his investment is likely to be expropriated, for no
businessman anywhere will put his money into a.
business in which he fears that he may lose his
investment.
To the investor, governmental respect for con-
tract rights is on a par with property rights.
The opportunity to earn a reasonable return on
its investment is the prize for which rivate enter-
prise strives at home and abroad. rivate enter-
prise generall requires no government guarantee
of a reasonable return. But it does demand as-
surance that overnments will not take actions
which will ma e a reasonable return impossible.
Historically, the development of an industrial
economy requires high inltial rates of return to
compensate f0r unusual risks in the early stages.
Then, as industries become established, as the pub—
lic acquires conﬁdence in government, as local cap-
ital is generated, competition forces down the rate
of return on both debt and equity investments.
