value of the study in future town plannin for its

In Turkey, a group of American grantees pro-
vided a lecture series, 0 on to the general public
in cooperation with the nited States Information
Service, covering such varied subjects as “Amer-
ican business methods and production techniques”,
“The importance of sportsmanship and fair play
in American sports”, and “American art and liter-
ature”. In India, an American lecturer estab-
lished a school of journalism in an Indian univer-
sity, and toured the country meetin editors and
visiting newspaper and printing p ants. Many
other instances could be cited of this growing ten-
dency of the pro ram to reach beyond university
circles, such as the seminar in Norway for labor
leaders, the citizenship education projects
launched in Philip ine communities by an Amer-
ican lecturer, and t e work of American teachers
there in bringing modern scientiﬁc methods of
agriculture to outlying farming communities.
In many countries, associations of former
grantees have been formed. These groups are
active in keeping alive interest in our country, as
well as in maintaining American contacts. United
States Foundations and Commissions also try to
keep in touch with unsuccessful candidates be-
cause of their interest in the United States. They
are often invited to attend local seminars on
American studies, placed on mailing lists for other
functions sponsored by the United States Infor-
mation Service and provided with surplus United
States Information Service books.
Evaluation of the Program
Evaluation studies continued to be made dur-
ing 1953 to assess the effectiveness of the over-all
exchange program in promoting favorable at-
titudes towards the United States, and in increas-
in understanding between the United States and
0t er countries. These studies have resulted so
far in the following general conclusions:
(1) The exchange experience causes foreign
grantees to change unrealistic and stereotyped
views of American life, particularly with regard
to the status of the family, the place of religion
in our national life, and the moral standards of
Americans. These changed attitudes can help
combat anti-American propaganda more effec-
tively than any overt efforts on our part, since they
result from convictions arising from having ob-
served the conduct and behavior of Americans on
a face-to-face basis.
(2) Grantees obtained a more favorable view
of the motives behind American foreign policy—
thereby strengthening beliefs in the genuineness
of our desire to prevent war, and weakening beliefs
that our foreign policy is motivated by imperi-
alistic designs. These views can hel the United
States in promulgating ideals an policies in
consonance with our aims.
(3) Such increased understanding of the
United States, althou h basicall perhaps im-
measurable, usually ta es some ohservable form
after grantees return home. J udgin from what
our cultural oﬂicers were able to o serve in a
special study of returned rantees, well over
half are deﬁnitely known to€>e reporting favor-
ably and actively to their fellow countrymen—in
s eeches, published writings, conversations, etc.—
a out their experiences in America. It is safe to
assume that a much greater proportion of grantees
engage in such activities.
American grantees have also gained a wider
understanding of the cultural, political and eco-
nomic life of other countries, according to a major
evaluation study carried out in 1953. In addi-
tion, they have come to develop an understanding
and appreciation of our own international prob-
lems. It was found that considerable rofesswnal
beneﬁts also resulted from their exc ange expe-
rience, and that former grantees were active in
extending hospitality to foreign visitors under
the rogram, in sharing experiences with their
localpcommunities through talks, appearances on
radio and television programs, and through
publications.
The recent ﬁndings of the Senate Foreign Re-
lations Committee’s Subcommittee on Overseas
Information Programs tend to support these con-
clusions. For example, the Committee reported
that the rogram “enjoys a high prestige both at
home and abroad, and is therefore able to attract
the voluntary participation of leading citi-
zens. Exchangees often are or may be-
come prominent in government, business and the
professions, and their potential impact on at-
titudes towards this country is considerable.
Evaluation studies were also made of certain
operational matters in efforts to further improve
the program. For example, one study showed
that certain foreign students obtained better ori-
entation through living in American homes for
a short period, than throu h orientation courses
at universities. As a res t, emphasis has been
given to this method of orientation—which is also
less expensive than university courses. Another
study was made of the performances of individ-
ual American grantees abroad, as a guide to screen-
ing committees in making future selections. Ad-
ditional studies included a survey of the English
language proﬁciency of foreign teachers as it
affected their experiences in this country.
