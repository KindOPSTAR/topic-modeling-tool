The Defense of Europe
And if we turn to Europe, we can see demon-
strated there the effectiveness of the policy which
is based on a poolin of the strength of the North
Atlantic nations. ﬁnd here again we can note
that the pace of the buildup, both military and
economic, has been adapted to the long pull. The
oals set at the sprin meeting of NATO husband
t e economic strengt of the Western Powers
rather than draining it.
However well gaited the NATO program, there
are still outstandin several roblems which will
have to be resolve before t e strong and inte-
ted framework of nations can become a real-
ity. We have recognized, from the beginning,
that a strong and secure European community
must include Germany. Certainly, it would be
foolish to talk of an effective Western defense
which did not include that country. It would be
ually foolish to discuss a defense of Germany
w ich did not involve Germans.
There are and have been two major obstacles
to brin 'n this about. One is the persistent So-
viet regisaﬁ to end the unnatural division of Ger-
many and the establishment of a puppet Commu-
nist state in East Germany. The second is the
reluctance of France to agree to the formation of
German military units and to accept a reconsti-
tuted Germany as a full and equal partner in the
proposed community.
French leaders and French voters are keenly
aware of bein overrun by German troo three
times in less tian a century—and the third time
is still fresh in the memory of most Frenchmen.
There is a fear that a rearmed West Germany
might try uniﬁcation by force. And to many
French, t ere is even greater hazard in a rearmed
German combined with the Soviet Union than
there is in the Red armies alone.
A solution to this difﬁcult was offered by the
French leaders themselves. hey proposed a Eu-
ropean Defense Community, to be ratiﬁed by the
member states, to which member nations would
transfer certain powers to direct a uniﬁed army
drawn from al members of the community.
Throu h the Community, \Vest German troops
could e enlisted without creating a German na-
tional army.
Because it was a commonsense solution to a ma-
jor problem of European defense, and because it
was a step toward European uniﬁcation, Eno has
had stron American backing. West Germany
has ratiﬁe the Community. So has the Nether-
lands. Bel 'um is moving in that direction. But
paradoxical y, France, the originator, has dragged
its feet.
There is a practical as well as a moral limit to
the inﬂuence this country can exert to bring E00
into being. \Ve can persuade. We can urge. But
more we cannot do, even if we would. France’s
decision must develop out of the free choice of her
leaders and her citizens. \Ve must simply pin
our faith on the fundamental commonsense of the
French people. For as Secretary Dulles has said:
Until the goals of Enc are achieved, NATO and indeed
future peace are in Jeopardy.
Ellorts Toward German Unlﬂcltlon
The question of the division of Germany and
the reconstitution of that country as a free and
independent nation is now being discussed b the
F oreign Ministers of Britain and France, ecre~
tary of State Dulles, and the Soviet Foreign Min-
ister. This meeting, the ﬁrst such since 1949,
came about as a result of an exchange of notes
between the three Western Powers and the Soviet
Union—an exchange in which the Soviet Union
came off second best.
For their own evil ends, the leaders of the
Soviet Union have stubbornly blocked German
uniﬁcation. At the same time, they have gone
to considerable lengths to mask their oppos1tion
to German unity and to attribute the continued
division of the country to the West. On the
numerous occasions when Britain, France, and the
United States proposed a meetin to settle the
question of Germany, the Soviet nion appeared
to concur. But the Kremlin’s reply invariably
osed conditions known to be unacceptable to the
est.
Last summer, after the East German uprisings,
the three Western Powers again elected to put the
question of a German settlement up to the Krem-
lin.’ The reply from Moscow followed the usual
pattern. Britain, France, and the United States
pursued the matter.
The diplomatic exchange that followed totaled
four notes and four responses.3 The Kremlin’s
third answer rejected ﬂatly the proposed four-
power conference on Germany and an Austrian
treaty. Instead the Kremlin suggested a ﬁve-
power meeting including Red China which would
deal generally with world tensions and presumably
relegate matters pertaining to Germany and Aus-
tria to secondary status.
This proposal effectively tore the camouﬂage
from the Soviet position. It was well known in
Moscow, as well as elsewhere, that a ﬁve-power
meeting with a general agenda was unacceptable
to the West. Thus the Kremlin proposal was
transparent. It added up to a ﬂat refusal to
discuss a German settlement.
World reaction to the Soviet stand was im-
mediate and the impact was felt in the Kremlin.
The Soviet leaders felt compelled to reverse
their ﬁeld on the matter of procedure. The ﬁnal
note in the series of four agreed to a four-power
