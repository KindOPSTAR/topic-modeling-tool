Korea and Indochina
I link Korea and Indochina because to me they
always represent two ﬂanks of the same vast
theater of action. They are both areas where
Communist aggression has resorted to force to
gain its objectives. In both, Communist force
was met with counterforce by free nations. In
both actions, the Chinese have encouraged the
local Communist forces, have provided extensive
material support, and in Korea ﬁnally actively
intervened in great military strength. In Korea,
United Nations resistance thrust them back to a
line behind that from which the assault was
launched. We were successful in bringing the
hostilities to a halt and prevented forcible re-
patriation of prisoners of war. We have been
trying to bring our enemies to a political confer-
ence table to discuss Korean uniﬁcation and inde-
pendence. The agreement reached at Berlin will
do this, and if the conference fails it will expose
Communist intentions even more clearly.
We are withdrawin two American divisions
from Korea. This wi 1 not reduce U.N. combat
power in Korea because the American divisions
will be replaced by two new Korean divisions.
At the same time our mobile naval, air, and am-
phibious forces are being further developed.
The difference is in the emphasis on national
forces for national defense and the added strength
and ﬂexibility which we ain.
You will recall that w en a truce was reached
in Korea, the 16 U.N. members engaged in the
ﬁghting joined in a declaration.2 They warned
the Chinese Communists that in the event of a
violation of the truce, of a renewal of the a es-
sion in all }probability it would not be possi e to
conﬁne the ostilities to Korea. At the same time,
Secretary Dulles also put the Chinese Communists
on notice that their open armed intervention in
Indochina would have “grave conseq’uences which
mi ht not be conﬁned to Indochina.’
e Chinese leaders cannot now contemplate
further aggressive moves in either area with the
assurance that their maximum risk is limited to
such casualties as may be sustained by their so-
called volunteers. This should deter any aggres-
sive adventures by the Chinese Communists.
The military situation in Indochina is favor-
able. Contrary to some reports, the recent ad-
vances made by the Viet Minh are largely “real
estate” operations.
The Communist technique is to advance through
an area where there is little or no opposition, cap-
ture villages which have no military signiﬁcance,
and then advertise the action as a major campaign.
The purpose behind these real estate oﬂ'ensives is
as much psychological as it is military. They
undoubtedly have some effect on the Vietnamese
and Laotian people, and they are no help to those

French leaders who want to press the ﬁghting in
Indochina until the job is ﬁnished.
Tactically, the French position is solid and the
oﬁicers in the ﬁeld seem conﬁdent of their ability
to deal with the situation.
Freedom as an Incentive
The shooting war in Indochina is only one base
of a broader war. \Ve are contending wit the
Communists on the political and psycholo 'cal
fronts as well. Despite the advantage with w ich
our enemies usually start in struggles of this sort,
we have been making some headway. It is essen-
tial that the Vietnamese peo le, and the people
of Laos and Cambodia as wel , be convinced that
they are ﬁghting for their own freedom, not for
colonialism. Once they are so convinced, they
will have the incentive necessary for success.
Very soon, representatives of the Governments
of Viet-Nam and of France meet in Paris to draw
up the treaty which will complete Vietnamese
independence. A similar treaty has already been
signed with Laos and one is in prospect for
Cambodia. I think that the signing of these
treaties of independence will be a vital step in
supplying the national regimes with prestige and
stature, and they should convince the peo le of
the Associated States that the French nion
forces are the forces of freedom.
Incidentally, I have read current reports of
extensive desertions by Vietnamese troops. A
thorough inquiry reveals that the reports are
greatly exaggerated. A total of 126 men were
involved, and they were not troops of a regularly
or anized unit but of the irregular militia.
e do not give enough credit to the French
Government for what it has done in Indochina.
The war is now in its 8th year. The cost of its
prosecution has been a steady and serious drain
on the economy of France. What used to be a
source of wealth is now a heavy expense, and
there is a steady increase in the casualty list.
To many practical Frenchmen it seems a point-
less and hopeless venture. To them it seems that
they are being asked to make continued sacriﬁces
in the interest of a former colony which is in
process of becoming independent, and which may
not elect to remain within the French Union. In
these circumstances, it is not surprisin that there
is considerable sentiment in France §or a nego-
tiated settlement—almost any settlement that will
let France extricate herself without further in-
jury or expense. So far, the Government has
been able to resist such pressure. It has been
sustained by the support of those who know that
France’s prestige as a world power is at stake and
who recognize F rance’s responsibility to her allies
of the free world.
