The imposition on Southeast Asia of the oliti-
cal system of Communist Russia and its C inese
Communist ally would be a grave threat to many.
It should not be passively accepted, but met by a
unity of will and, if need be, unity of action.
Free World Unlty
The present world situation calls for a large
measure of unity and cooperation on the part of
the non-Communist nations, not only in relation
to Indochina, but in relation to many matters.
Not one of us alone could face with conﬁdence an
encounter with the Soviet bloc. Its rulers now
hold in their tight control 800 million people and
they develo these people and the vast national
resources 0 their lands into a great ower ma-
chine. This machine is equip ed wit the most
modern instruments of mass estruction. These
they develop with no inhibitions. Fortunately,
the free world ca acit for instantaneous retali-
ation neutralizes t is t ireat of mass destruction.
Otherwise, this ower to annihilate, coupled with
lack of all morarrestraint, would be an intimidat-
ingqinﬂuence of unprecedented potency.
one should doubt that the Soviet rulers still
seek world domination. The recent four-power
conference at Berlin served strikingly to demon-
strate that the Communist leaders cannot reconcile
themselves to human freedom and feel that, be-
cause freedom is contagious, they must try to
stamp it out. This basic incompatibility of com-
munism with freedom drives them always to seek
to extend their area of control. This is not
merely due to lust for power, but to genuine fear
of freedom.
It is true that the Soviet leaders are professing
a desire for eaceful coexistence in Europe. But,
as the Berlin conference revealed, the Soviet
rulers will take no step, however little, to relax
their grip on their captive peo les. Not only do
they keep Germany divided an Austria occupied,
but they seek by every device to extend their power
to Western Euro . The * seek to perpetuate
divisions, notably hitween rance and German ,
which cannot ossiny serve an one who genuine y
seeks peace. ey seek, bv in ltration, to disrupt
the unity and stren h of NATO.
Only incredible lindness, or the most wishful
of thinkin , could lead us to believe that the danger
is over an that each free nation could now safely
go its separate way. We must sta united.
The maintenance of unity calls or understand-
ing and forbearance and coo eration on the part
of all of the free nations. T ere is a natural im-
patience in each free country with the conditions
which require us, for so long, to walk in step with
each other. In some countries, there are those
who protest that the cooperation of their govern-
ments in this common cause shows subserviency
and that they should prove their inde ndence by
practicing isolationism. Some in t is countr
eel that the United States would do better if it
relieved itself of military and economic burdens
and political anxieties which now thrust them-
selves upon us from every quarter of the globe.
The main goal of Soviet strate is to break the
free world apart. All of their iplomacy, their
propa anda, their pressures, their inducements,
have t 1is aim. These efforts are not altogether
without success.
This United States mutual security program is
one of the wa s to revent the success of Soviet
strategy. It elps indispensably to maintain a
unity which is vltal to our own security. ‘Vith~
out that unity, the United States would quickly be
forced to become a garrison state and the stran-
gling noose of communism would be drawn ever
ti hter about us.
urge, therefore, that this program be given
your prompt and sympathetic consideration. It
1s a measure for the security of the United States
and for the maintenance of freedom in the world.
Iranian Oll Negotiatlons
Press release 188 dated April 10
Following is the text of a statement by Score-
tary Dulles regarding the forthcoming oil nego-
tiations at Tehran:
The U.S. Government takes satisfaction in the
fact that negotiations are about to begin at Tehran
between the Iranian Government and representa-
tives of the oil companies from several countries.
We understand that these negotiations will have
as their purpose the resumption of large-scale oil
production in Iran on terms consistent with the
reasonable safeguarding of foreign capital within
the structure and rights of the national sover-
ei t .
h: U.S. Government is not directly involved
in the commercial negotiations but Wlll observe
them with great interest. The interruption of oil
production seriously hindered Iran’s own efforts
toward social and economic progress, and the
resumption of the ﬂow of oi With consequent
revenue will strengthen a friendly Middle Eastern
country.
The issues which are involved in the negotia-
tions will, no doubt, require careful study. How-
ever, already there is evidence of good will and
mutual respect which gives good hope that a satis-
factory agreement can be reached.
