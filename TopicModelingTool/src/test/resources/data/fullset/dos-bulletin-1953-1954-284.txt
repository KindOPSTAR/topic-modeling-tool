giving its full endorsement and support to the
rinciples upon which that or anization was
ounded. In restrictin trade wnth Communist
China, which the Unite Nations has branded as
an aggressor, Japan maintains a higher level of
export controls than an of the nations of Western
Europe. This it does espite its need for expand-
ing exports.
Phlllpplne-U. S. Interests In Japanese Trade
In this entire matter, it seems to me, the inter-
ests of the Philippines and the United States are
identical. Our economies and our trade are vitally
inﬂuenced by the march of events in the Paciﬁc.
We are both unalterably opposed to the expansion
of aggressive communism in the Far East or else-
where. We both would deprive the Iron Curtain
countries of the tools for aggression by restricting
the export of strategic materials. Yet we actively
seek to expand our trade with the free nations of
the world on a mutually proﬁtable basis. We de-
sire for ourselves and for others mounting pur-
chasing power and improved levels of living with
all that implies. In the strug le to attain these ob-
'ectives, Japan will inevitab y play a part. If
y its own efforts and with the cooperation of
others, it can develo a self-supporting economy,
its contribution to t 1e general welfare will cer-
tainl y be enhanced.
The current members of the Government of
Japan are not those who led it down the road to
disaster in 1941 and caused so much ain and suf-
fering in this part of the world. he physical
havoc then created I have had some occasion to
evaluate and understand. No, many of the resent
Ja anese ofﬁcials were themselves 'ailed y the
mi itary clique who then controlle the country
and are now thoroughly discredited. I am con-
ﬁdent that the Japanese today have no aggressive
design or intent. Instead, the wish to live in
peace and trade with proﬁt. his desire is also
yours and mine. If it is to be accomplished, we
cannot overlook the potential contribution of 87
million eople or neglect the important oppor-
tunity or cooperative endeavor which can be
mutually beneﬁcial.
Transfer of Custody of POW’s
In Korea Outlined
Following is the text of a statement made b
Gen. Julius K. Lacey, senior member of the UJW.
Command, Military Armistice Commission, at a
meeting of the Commission on January 23:
As your side knows the Neutral Nations Repa-
triation Commission avoided its obligation to
release the prisoners of war to civilian status at
0001 hours 23 January. In his letter of 14 January
the chairman, Neutral Nations Repatriation Com-
mission, requested the two sides to accept restora-
tion of custody of the prisoners of war beginning
at 0900 hours 20 January.1 The commander of our
side replied : '
I reiterate the unalterable conviction of the United Na-
tlons (‘ommand that the Neutral Nations Repatriation
Commission has a solemn obligation to fulﬁll its responsi-
bilities and release to civilian status at 23 January all
prisoners of war who have refused repatriation. Failure
of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to fulﬁll
this obligation would be a deliberate BYOidIIlII‘Q of an im-
portant element of the Terms of Reference and the United
Nations Command could not concur in an action consti-
tuting default by the Neutral Nations Repatriation
Commission.
The Unith Nations Command cannot accept custody of
these prisoners of war in accordance with the terms of
your proposaL
The commander of our side pointed out that in
view of the desire, expressed by the chairman,
Neutral Nations Command, with res t to custody
of those risoners of war formerly etained by our
side, the nited Nations Command would of neces-
sity have to be prepared to arrange for their ac-
commodation, and disposition in the event that
such restoration of custody was undertaken.
Des ite the expreSSed unwillingness of the
Unite Nations Command to accept their custody
under the existin conditions of default by the
Neutral Nations epatriation Commission, that
commission decided to return the prisoners of war.
Consequently, the United Nations Command was
forced, for humanitarian reasons, to accept the
prisoners of war and provide for their accommoda—
tion and disposition.
Our side has, in accordance with the provisions
of the terms of reference and because of the fail-
ure of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commis-
sion to discharge its responsi ilities, released to
civilian status at 0001 hours 23 Januar 1954 those
prisoners of war restored to our cust y on 20 and
21 J anuary.a \
So that your side may know the truth, our side
will outline the operations of transfer of custody
which took place on 20 and 21 January. “'e sug-
gest that on seek veriﬁcation of these facts from
the cust ian force, India.
The transfer of the prisoners of war to the cus-
tody of our side by the custodian force, India from
the South Camp on 20 and 21 January was accom-
plished in an orderly and quiet manner. The pro-
cedure prescribed by the custodian force, India
was desngned to provide each prisoner of war with
a ﬁnal opportunity to request repatriation if he
desired.
The prisoners were instructed by the custodian
force, India prior to their release that each pris-
oner would proceed from the inner gate to the
outer gate 0 their compound individually, while
