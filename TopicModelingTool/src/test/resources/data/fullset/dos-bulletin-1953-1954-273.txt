of the system from any of the four states and
would assure the equitable division of the water in
accordance with accepted en ineering principles.
My discussions in the region iave not yet reached
the point of speciﬁcs With respect to this inter-
national “water-master,” so to speak; but there
would seem to be no reason why such a mechanism
could not in due course be created, assuming ac-
ce tance of a uniﬁed plan by the four valley states.
he development program pro'ected in the re-
port which I discussed on my rst visit to the
region 3 months ago is based on a very considerable
body of engineering data contained in authorita-
tive reports compiled b a number of different
experts over a period 0 years. In substance, it
contemplates the storage of down-valley irri a-
tion water in Lake Tiberias and its control ed
release through a system of irrigation canals along
both sides of the main stream. Two headwater
reservoirs, partly for storage and partly for power,
would be constructed—one on the Hasbani within
the borders of Lebanon; the other on the Yar-
mouk, in Jordan.
Thus harnessed and controlled, the waters of the
Jordan system would rovide steady year-round
irrigation for a total 0 some 234,000 acres of land
not now irrigated in Jordan, Israel, and Syria-—
104,000 acres in Israel, 122,500 acres in Jordan, and
approximate] 7,500 acres in Syria. Of the total
waters available, it would allocate about 426 mil-
lion cubic meters a year to Israel, about 829 mil-
lion cubic meters a year to Jordan, and about 50
million a year to Syria. Some 38,000 kilowatts
of electric energy would be roduced through 'a
power installation on the armouk, and some
27,000 kilowatts at another plant near Tel Hai in
Israel.
These ﬁgures are, of course, preliminary esti-
mates and sub'ect to revision as more precise data
become avail: le as the result of on-the-ground
studies. They do, however, serve to indicate an
ap roximate proportionate allocation of the avail-
a e waters of the Jordan basin among the states
involved. The apparent disparity between the
amounts of water proposed for Israel and Jordan
and the area of land to be irrigated in each of
these countries is explained b the fact that the
Jordanian lands are lower in t e valley, requiring
a much higher per-acre application of water than
the area to be irrigated in Israel. Much of the
land in Jordan can produce crops all year round.
Quite aside from the obvious physical and eco-
nomic beneﬁts to be derived from a comprehensive
valley development program, the United States
is interested in easing the tensions which con-
tribute to regional uncertainty and impede eco-
nomic progress in the area. The project we have
put forward would, in my opinion, have a very
considerable effect in this respect.
For one thing, it would provide a basis for de-
ciding who is entitled to how much of the water
of the Jordan, and unless this is decided with
some degree of mutual agreement it is all too easy
to foresee the possibility of protracted bickering
and liti ation, and even the danger of open hos-
tility. he waters of the Jordan can be a con-
structive blessing to the peoples of the valle ;
they can also be the cause of destructive stri e.
We are roposing no more than a reasonable effort
to divi e these waters equitabl among the coun-
tries which have a claim on them, in order that
the lands of the valley may be developed in an w
orderly and peaceful way.
We would anticipate, of course, that a substan-
tial area of the land to be irrigated in Jordan
would be allotted to Arab refugees from Palestine.
About a third of these unfortunate and unhappy
people could be iven a solid economic base, a new
lease on life, on ands watered through the project
we have outlined. Certainly this opens a possi-
bility it would be unfair to these homeless eople
to ignore. It offers them the dignity of alliveli-
hood on the land for the continuing indignity of
international relief and represents a be inning to-
ward a ermanent solution of one o the most
vexing o the region’s problems.
In conclusion, let me say that I do not under-
estimate the possibility that this program will be
rejected by some or all of the Jordan Valley states.
I hope sincerely that they will accept it, for it
represents, in my opinion, a clear manifestation
of our sincere desire to be of help. I hope that
the states concerned will let us he] in this way
to ease the dangerous situation whic exists in the
area and to promote the peaceful and orderly de-
velopment which their peo le so earnestly desire.
It is in that hope that I Wlll pursue my mission.
Turkey—Land of Progress and Promise
by Samuel W. Anderson 1
The ofﬁcial visit to the United States by the
President of Turkey has already provoked a jour-
nalistic tide of favorable comment on the strides
Turkey has made in recent years toward hi her
standards of living and increased political ree-
dom for all of its citizens. President Celal Bayar
is a living symbol of a nation of people determined
to obtain the full beneﬁts of modern scientiﬁc ro-
duction and the maximum degree of indivi ual
liberty. The sweeping economic and political
changes which have taken place durin the past 4
years reﬂect the dynamic nature of Turiish societ
and the energy and determination of the Turkish
people.
During this period we have observed three basic
but interrelated types of change in Turkey which
