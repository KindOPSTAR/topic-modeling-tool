None of us realizes fully his ideals. But the
essential is to have ideals and to try to practice
them. I expect that we shall do so here.
In that conviction I look to our Conference with
eager anticipation. It will, I believe, be both a
source of satisfaction to ourselves and also a sym-
bol which will show men everywhere how good
can be the fruits of freedom.

The Organization of Voluntary Foreign Aid: 1939—1953
by Arthur 0. enigma
The Marshall plan initiated far-reaching gov-
ernmental and intergovernmental programs of
economic and technical assistance with which the
public is familiar. The ublic is familiar too with
appeals for personal he p to the less fortunate in
other lands. \Vhat is not so well known is the
character, scope, and organization of this help
from the time of the invasion of Poland in 1939
to the truce in Korea in 1953 and the collabora-
tion of the Government with the agencies en-
trusted with the pubiic’s support. A summary of
this phase of our forei interests is recorded in
view of the transfer 0 the Advisory Committee
on Voluntary Foreign Aid from the Department
of State to the Foreign Operations Administra-
tion on Jul 1, 1953.

World ar I relief was exten ed without dis-
crimination and in continuing measure to the war-
suﬂ'erers. Relief work was undertaken by Herbert
Hoover following the invasion of Belgium in 1914
carried on in the Central and Eastern States of
Europe after the Armistice, and concluded with
the end of the famine in Soviet Russia in 1923.
The American peo le responded again, warmly
and generously, to t e needs of friend and former
foe alike, following the outbreak of World War
II—and this aid continues.
This response has ex ressed itself through the

well as through the money remittances and parcels

Personal Aspect of Overseas Rollo!
It is gratifying that our church and lay agencies
have effectively administered the free~will offerings
of the American people for overseas relief. These
private gifts of funds and goods since the invasion
of Poland in 1939 have amounted in value to more
than 81.500.000.000. The intelligent giving and the
planned distribution of these resources is an ex-
ample of constructive philanthropy of continuing
value.
In the above connection. cooperation with gov-
ernment has been useful. Yet the essential volun-
tary and personal aspect. “people-to-peopie," has
been maintained. This relationship. while no sub-
stitute for governmental grants, has an indispensa-
ble quality that no government-to-government aid
can duplicate. It has created sympathy and good
will between our citizens and their feilowmen in
ailied and former enemy countries, and has fostered
an understanding of common problems. This
humanitarianism is a force of enduring strength
that can bind together the peoples of the world.
