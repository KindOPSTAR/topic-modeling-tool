larity. Almost 9 years after the end of \Vorld
War II, we have still not concluded the rincipal
treaties of peace and we still suffer from t e legacy
of destruction and loss of manpower. The (,om-
munists have enslaved millions and there is the
constant threat of enslaving millions more. New
states have arisen. Former enemy states are mov-
ing back into the family of nations. Others, such
as India, are achieving greater stature in inter-
national affairs. Within the United Nations the
charter assumption of the unity of the Great
Powers has broken down with the result that the
role of the Security Council has been eclipsed and
the role of the General Assembly enhanced. And
above the whole scene hovers the new and awesome
character of modern weapons of warfare. \Ve do
not feel that these forces can somehow be legis-
lated out of existence. Indeed, the present charter
could carry far more traﬂic than it presently does,
if there were the will on both sides to cooperate
for peace. But in the light of these developments,
and considering the s ecial role thrust on our
country today, it is logical that we should review
the charter to determine whether the dynamic po-
litical changes since \Vorld War II make it desir-
able to change the charter itself.
It is now time to ask some basic questions about
our general approach to charter review. First,
what kind of problem is it? Secondly, what are
the proper limits of a charter review conference?
Thirdly, what are our objectives?
Nature of the Charter Revlew Problem
Charter review is essentially a political prob-
lem. \Vhen we talk about review of the charter,
inevitably we are talking about world politics
and political relationshi among sovereign states.
The United Nations to ay is an association of
states where decisions are implemented through
voluntary action by these states. This fact places
certain limitations on charter review as we will see
later.
We are aware that the difficulties encountered
in the operation of the United Nations today are
a product of pvtzllitical attitudes and actions of
governments. e recognize that dynamic soci-
eties oftentimes place great strains on the legal
documents which ide their actions. We know
that we have to 100 at the practical relationshi s
between the charter and political reality. e
know that our task is to determine whether chan es
in the charter can foster desirable and feasi le
developments from the oint of view of the na-
tional interest of the United States and the paral-
lel interests of the free world.
This immediately raises the corollary question
of how the United Nations has worked in the past
8 years. I should not want to give the impres-
sion that we believe the United Nations is a perfect
instrument, or that it operates just as we want it
to. Not at all. It has its full share of faults.
We have had less than 9 years of experience with
this new tool. That is a very short time in the
history of political institutions. It is long enough
to reveal shortcomings, but not lon enough to
correct them all. We know that U. . action is
cumbersome. It is generally slow. Being with-
out coercive power, in the sense that a state has
political power, spokesmen in the United Nations
sometimes indulge in irresponsible talk or action.
What is more serious is a tendency in the United
Nations to push this ﬂedgling organization too
fast and too far. Member states which have re-
cently gained their own independence, for
example, are prone to demand complete and im-
mediate inde ndence for all other dependent
territories, \viether or not these territories are
ready for it and whether or not they can support
themselves or protect themselves.
Despite the imperfections I have just noted,
the United Nations has adapted its practices to a
fast-changing world. It is equally a parent that
we have scarcely be n to realize the great po-
tentialities of the United Nations. One might say
of the charter, as Chief Justice Marshall said of
the Constitution of the United States that “it was
intended to endure for ages to come, and it is con-
sequently to be adapted to the various crises of
human affairs.” The charter is not rigid or static.
Like our own Constitution, the charter was made
ﬂexible enough to be adaptable to the exigencies
which in the words of Chief Justice Holmes, “can-
not have been foreseen by the most gifted of its
be ettors.”
he broad and comprehensive strokes used by
the framers of the charter have permitted de-
velopments to take lace not entirely envisaged
at San Francisco. t me give you two concrete
examples of how this 8-year old organization has
demonstrated a high degree of constitutional
ada tability.
T ie ﬁrst relates to the veto. Article 27 (3) of
the charter rovides that the Security Council
shall make ecisions on nonprocedural matters
“by an afﬁrmative vote of seven members includ-
ing the concurring votes of the permanent mem—
bers.” On the face of the charter this would mean
that each reat ower must vote yes or a resolu-
tion will ail. Xctually, the constitutional prac-
tice of abstention has developed so that a reso-
lution supported by any seven members is not
defeated unless a great power votes no. More-
over, the practice of abstention has been extended
so that deliberate absence by a great power, such
as the Soviet absence during the June 25 and 27
debates on Korea in the Security Council, will not
prevent that organ from acting. Since this ex-
perience in 1950, the Soviet Union has not ven-
tured to boycott the Security Council.
The most signiﬁcant demonstration of United
Nations ﬂexibility in light of changing political
conditions is the “Uniting for Peace” resolution
which was adopted by the General Assembly in
Aprll 26, I954
