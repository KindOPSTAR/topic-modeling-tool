U.S. NOTE
The Embassy of the United States of America
presents its com liments to the Ministry of For-
eign Affairs of t e Union of Soviet Socialist Re-
publics and has the honor to request the Ministry’s
assistance in the following matter:
The United States Government has recently re-
ceived reports which support earlier indications
that American prisoners of war who had seen
action in Korea have been transported to the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and that they
are now in Soviet custody. The United States
Government desires to receive urgently all infor-
mation available to the Soviet Government con-

Ministry of Foreign Aﬁ'airs of the Union of oviet
Socialist Republics on May 5, 1954, the Ministry
has the honor to state the following:
The United States Government’s assertion con-
tained in the indicated note that American rison-
ers of war who participated in military actions in
Korea have alle edly been transferred to the

kept under Soviet guard is devoid of an founda-
tion whatsoever and is clearly far-fete ed, since

Progress Toward World Brotherhood
by Deputy Under Secretary Murphy 1
In accepting the citation and testimonial pre-
sented to me y the Massachusetts Committee of
Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, which I do with
humility, I am conscious of a double honor: ﬁrst,
that you have judged me worthy to receive it;
second, that you have seen ﬁt to bestow it upon
me in the distinguished company of Gen. David
Sarnoff and Gen. William F. Dean.
‘Address made before the Massachusetts Committee
of Catholics, Protestants, and Jews at Boston, Mass, on
May 6 (press release 235).
In the citation just read to me was the phrase
“enlightened Americanism.” That is one of the
things I want to talk about tonight. It seems
to me to be a peculiarly appro riate theme before
this outstandlng group w o ave for a number
of years been practicing it with such marked
effect.
The oal I believe most Americans seek is world
brother ood. But if we are to succeed in persuad-
ing men to acce t the ideal of brotherhood uni-
versall , we shal have to demonstrate increas-
ingly that it is attainable. You in Massachusetts
have achieved a notable degree of brotherhood
in a great community, and in so doin you are
giving a practical demonstration of “en ightened
Amerlcanism.”
Other communities throughout the country
have in recent years shown a similar spirit. Our
Nation as a whole has always pro essively cher-
ished tolerance, understanding an the acceptance
of minority groups both religious and racial.
Some of this progress has come by law. But all
of it has been possible only because the hearts
of men have been warmed as their minds have
been enlightened.
We have advanced toward brotherhood in the
Western Hemisphere. No longer do many of our
neighbors among the Republics of Latin America
think of us apprehensively as the colossus of the
North. Instead, we are “ ood neighbors.” This
relationship, as Secretary ulles said a few weeks
ago in Caracas, has been tried and tested over the
years. It has worked. Indeed, it is held up toda
as a model. As you know, the Rio Pact of 194
served as the pattern for the NATO Agreement-—
and I may add, although it is perhaps a dubious
distinction, Mr. Molotov also took the wording of
the Rio Pact and used it in phrasing the European
Security pact which he 0 ered in Berlin. The
sham was quickly exposed when the Soviet For-
eign Minister was reminded that words alone can-
not make an agreement. “Peace,” says the Rio
Treaty, “is founded on justice and moral order
and, consequently, on the international reco i-
tion and protection of human rights and ee-
doms. . . .”
In our hemisphere we are working to prove
increasingly the substance underlyin these
words. It is, if you please, “enlightene Amer-
icanism” in action.
A great American statesman, Dr. Alberto Lleras
Cam argo, who has been President of the Republic
of Colombia and Secretary-General of the Or-
ganization of American States, spoke these words
at San Francisco when the nations of the world
met in 1945 to draft and approve the charter of
the United Nations:
None of the concepts of international law which govern
the relations of the peoples of this hemisphere can be
termed a typically American creation. But how much
effort, how many wars, how much pain, how much misery
has it cost European civilization for centuries to implant
a principle which, among us, is accepted at :1 Pan Ameri-
