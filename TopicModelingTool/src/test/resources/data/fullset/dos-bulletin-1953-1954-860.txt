The answer, of course, is that the man and the
white polar bear are standing on meridians which
are 180° apart, so that they are diametrically op-
posite across the North Pole, and that both are
12.73 rods from the pole. The “small circle”
parallel of latitude on which both man and bear
are located therefore has a circumference of 80
rods; and the bear is both 40 rods due east and 40
rods due west of the man (ﬁgure 1).




Figure 1. Man shooting polar bear 40 rods due east
of him
The diameter, 25.46 rods, which is a meridian and there-
fore a great circle, is less than the 1,0-rod semicireumfer-
ence of a “small circle,” which is, of course, a parallel of
latitude. The bear is thus both 1,0 rods due east and 40
rods 'due west of the man, but only 25.46 rods north and
south from the man—across the North Pole.
Very few people know what a series of great
circle routes looks like on a Mercator or any other
map (ﬁgure 2). Certainly from the maps they
use (always ﬁat) they don’t almost instinctively
visualize world relationships as they exist on the
round world we live on.
It would be surprising if a few of the facts
which are presented below do not surprise even
some professional geographers. Misconceptions
of the shape and size of the territory of the Soviet
Union, for example, are among the most widely
entertained. How many realize that the distance
east-west across Africa, from Dakar to Cape
Guardafui, is almost the same as the distance from
Odessa, on the Black Sea, near the southwestern
corner of the USSR, to Bering Strait and that
the great circle between those two Russian points
passes between Moscow and Leningrad and be-
tween Murmansk and Arkhangelsk and within
ﬁve degrees of the North Pole?
People in the United States think of Buenos
Aires and Montevideo as being in “this hemi-
sphere” and therefore relatively near, but seldom
realize that those two South American cities are
as far from \Vashington, D. C., as are Istanbul,
Turkey; Igarka, U.S.S.R., in Siberia (on the
Yenesei River) ; and the westernmost of the
Aleutian Islands. Santiago, Chile is farther
from \Vashinglton than is Moscow. Mexico City
is nearer lVas ington by nearly 500 statute miles
than is Los Angeles, Calif.
A good corrective of American geographical
ideas is “World View and Strategy’ by Richard
E. Harrison and Hans W. Weigert in Compass
of the World. Professor Halford J. Mackinder,
busy “setting 11 the teaching of political and his-
torical geograp y at the universities of Oxford
and London,” and “notin current events with
a teacher’s eye for generalization,” presented his
paper that later became famous, “The Geographi-
cal Pivot of History,” in J anuar 1904. HIS most

Figure 2. A family of great circles on a Mercator-type
map
This is part of a series of great circle routes plotted on
a Miller cylindrical projection—which is a mathematical
modiﬁcation of a Mercator projection, placing the paral-
lels of latitude closer together, and bringing the geographi-
cal poles within a ﬁnite distance of the equator. Only the
northern half of the so-called Western ‘Hemisphere is
shown above. If continued around the world each of
these great circles would constitute a mirror image in the
southern half of the Eastern Hemisphere, likewise ter-
minating at 0" latitude, 180° longitude.
When an extensive series of such great circle courses is
printed on transparent plastic it may be moved to the
right or left on the map (keeping the equators of map and
diagram always together), so as to bring any two points
on. the earth’s surface onto one of these curves—or on a
curve readily interpolated between two that are printed.
The great circle course and approximate distance between
any two points may thus be readily determined.
A map of the world, equatorial scale 1:30,000,000, ap-
proximately 57 a: 35 inches, with relief in color, and with
a series of 80 complete great circle courses similar to
those illustrated above printed on the back, was prepared
for the Department of State by the American Geographical
Society. Copies may be purchased from that Society,
Broadway at 156th Street, New York 32, N. Y., for 81
folded, or $2.50 in a mailing tube; but the order should
specify that a copy of the map with a “great circle nomo-
graph" on the back is desired.
