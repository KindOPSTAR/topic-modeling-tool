control lists appeared to be reachin the point of
diminishing returns. It was decid not to pursue
an extension of the lists to man other items-
though items would always be added occasionally
because of changed conditions or new information.
On the other hand the Government reco ized
a need for simplifyi the lists and removmg or
downgrading items, agiich, in the li ht of current
information, were no longer deeme to be so im-
portant. The Government believed that much
could be done in the months to come, if done care-
fully and with due regard for security, to adjust
the controls to a “long-haul” basis. (Develop-
ments in the ﬁrst half of 1954 will be reported 111
the next Battle Act report.)
In general, it was decided to concentrate on seek-
ing more effective control of those items which, if
shi ped, would make a signiﬁcant contribution
to Soviet warmaking power.
The main thrust from the United States toward
improvement of the control system, it was decided,
would be in the ﬁeld of im lementation and en-
forcement of controls. N ota le deﬁciencies existed
in that ﬁeld. To overcome them the free nations
would need to keep improving their techniques,
and would need closer international collaboration
and pooling of information.
The new direction also took into account, even
more than ever, the economic and political prob-
lems of free-world countries. Free-world unity
was so vital, and the economic health of free na-
tions so important to the defense of free institu-
tions, that problems of our allies deserved to be
given reat weight in determining the actions of
this overnment in the East-“Test trade ﬁeld.
This was not a new concept, but this Government
felt that such problems needed to be discussed
among the free countries more than in the past.
In setting the new direction the Government
recognized—
(1) that maintaining commercial ties between
the free world and the Soviet bloc—compatible
with the security requirements of the free
world—may have positive advantages during
the present period of tension;
(2) that there are, however, risks that trade
may in some cases lead to undue reliance on the
Soviet bloc as a trading partner;
(3) that it is important to encourage trade
within the free world. including the entry of
commodities into the United States, by reducin
trade barriers, especially when the effect of suc
action would be to decrease the reliance of the
free world on the Soviet bloc.
Those were among the highlights of the new
direction. As explained before, the basic eco-
nomic defense policy was not altered.
Revlewlng the Control Lists
_In the li ht of this basic policy, and its new
dlrectlon, t e Government agencies responsible
for economic defense were engaged in certain
projects during the period covered by this report.
One of the most important of these projects was
the review of the control lists. This review was
a complex and time-consuming operation, which
continued into 1954.
It is easy for the public to become confused
about control lists, not onl because of their neces-
sarily secret nature but a so because there are so
many lists, serving different purposes.
The United States has had three main lists for
its own exports:
The munitions list, compiled and administered
by the De artment of State; the atomic energy
list, compi ed and administered b the Atomic
Ener Commission; and a muc longer list,
coverlng all other controlled items which is com-
iled and administered by the bepartment of
ommerce.
In addition there are the Battle Act lists. They
relate to potential ex orts from other countries
to the Soviet bloc. ey include those primary
strategic items which we believe the other free-
world countries should embargo in the interest of
mutual security.
Then there are lists consistin of those items—
at varying levels of control—w ich the cooperat-
ing free-world nations have accepted as a part of
their informal coordination of controls.
All of these lists are subject to a continual proc-
ess of review. But as a part of the new direction
in United States olic , this continuing review
process was broad)ene into an intensive reap-
praisal. Specialists from several Government
agencies were reevaluating all our listings in terms
of sharper and more meaningful criteria, and in
the light of all the new relevant technical and in-
telligence information that could be assembled.
This review would furnish the basis for appro-
priate ad'ustments and for United States discus-
sions wit other governments in 1954 concerning
the coverage of export controls.
East-West Trade: Road to Peace
It is a part of the economic defense policy of the
United States never to lose sight of the vital need
to kee open all paths that might lead to a sounder
basis or peace in the world.
We not only recognize the economic beneﬁts
that free-world nations can get from an expand-
ing East-West trade in peaceful goods; we also
bear in mind the possibility that trade contacts
can help to improve relations among peoples.
But in ho ing for and working toward that end,
we are not t ereby acce ting the belief that inter-
national trade inevitab and automatically leads
toward peace. Hitler’s zermany expanded its for-
ei n trade right up to the outbreak of World War
If We must view with skepticism the Communist
propaganda line on trade and peace, for we know
what their trading objectives and methods are.
