As Secretary of State Dulles recently put it:
We do not want weak or subservient allies. Our friends
and allies are dependable just because they are unwilling
to be anyone‘s satellites.
This rinciple of voluntary cooperation con-
trasts s larply with Communist practice. The
Kremlin relies on force and punishes deviation. I
believe that this reliance on force, this insistence
on absolute conformity, is a symptom of the basic
weakness of the Soviet system. It is a confes-
sion that only through compulsion can the Krem-
lin maintain its control over the subject peo les.
At this point, a question might arise. lgow is
that a weakness? As long as the Kremlin can
apply force, they can continue to rule. The fact
is that, over the long pull, the effectiveness of force
diminishes. After a time, the use of force must be
increased to obtain the same results. Inevitably
a saturation point is reached. Then the regime
starts to slip.
Comfortin though this prospect is, it may never
be realized i we sit idl by just waiting for it to
happen. Fundamental y, the factor that requires
the use of force by the Communist leaders is the
contrast between the vitality and productiveness
of a free society and the sterility of totalitarian
rule. The contrast exerts a constant pressure on
the Communist structure. But the extent and
amount of that pressure depends on us. The more
effectively and the more vigorously the free na-
tions demonstrate the superiority of their system
over the Communist structure of slavery, the
sooner we can expect the saturation point to be
reached.
Let me repeat—this is a long-term prospect. It
may be 10 years, 20 or perhaps 30 years before it
develops. In the meantime we have our work
cut out for us.
First of all, we have had to look to our defenses.
We have had to build, and should continue to
build, our own strength, military and economic.
And we have helped our associates build theirs.
It is an effort that must be continued. However,
there has been a signiﬁcant shift in the course to
be pursued in reaching our security objectives.
In the ostwar period, when it was demonstrated
that the oviet policy was clearly aggressive and
im erialistic, the free nations took steps designed
to rustrate the aims of the Kremlin. \Vorld War
II had left the economies of the nations of \Vestern
Europe in a state bordering on collapse—a condi-
tion which left them perilously vulnerable to
Communist takeover.
The U.S. response to this threat was a rogram
of economic reconstruction whereby the Vestern
nations were enabled to st back on their feet.
Greek-Turkish aid bloc ed a Soviet thrust into
the Mediterranean.
The North Atlantic Treaty rovided an essen-
tial olitical framework for a estern coalition.
T e military-aid program helped materially in
the development of an integrated force-in-being
which serves the dual purpose of discouraging a
Communist aggression and being ready to deal
with an attack should one occur.
With United States initiative, the United Na-
tions drove back the assault of the Communists on
the Republic of Korea. The United States also
extended material aid to the French Union forces
in Indochina.
These and other similar measures have been
effective. But essentially they were a response to
a Soviet Communist threat. In other words, the
Kremlin had the initiative. The Red leaders were
picking the time, the place, and the means, and
the free nations were limited to counteraction.
The strategic disadvantage of this situation is
obvious.
The Eeenomle Burden
But there was another risk involved which was
less ap arent: an economic risk. One tactic of
the Red) campaign against the West was to weaken
the individual nations by overextending them. If
the democracies could be drawn into assuming an
excessive burden in the way of military expendi-
tures, their economic strength might be sapped to
a point where, as Stalin once put it, “they would
be ready for the decisive blow.”
The security measures which have been adopted
by this country and its allies to meet the Com-
munist threat were essential—and very costly.
Their indeﬁnite continuance risked overtaxing
the strength of the free nations and invited grave
economic, political, and social consequences.
The remedy can be simply described—maximum
strength at a cost within our capacity to pay. A
policy which would produce this remedy would
guarantee to the free nations the necessary stamina
to maintain long-range safeguards for their
security.
It is all very well to describe such a policy, but
the policy itself only becomes possible and prac-
tical in proper circumstances. First of all, when
a nation or nations face a real emergency, there
must be action. There is no time to go shopping
around, to experiment to see if less expensive or
less painful methods wouldn’t serve as well.
Secondly, while a voluntary association of na-
tions may prosper temporarily with one of the
group shoulderin a disproportionate share of the
burden, such a re ationshi does not have a lon
life expectancy. In the ong run, this unequa
relationship destroys the mutual respect and co-
operation upon which the partnership is built.
For a number of years after World War II, the
United States and the free world were compelled
to meet a succession of emergencies. This country
bore a heavy proportion of the burden. To a great
degree this was unavoidable. But we were expend~
ing great amounts of time and energy utting out
ﬁres with little left over to devote or the ﬁre
prevention which would prevent the blazes from
starting.
