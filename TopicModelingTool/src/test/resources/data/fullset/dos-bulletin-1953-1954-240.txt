to try untiringly and relentlessly to turn the
riod of relative peace in which we live today
into a stable and real peace. The attainment of
that aim calls for a great degree of patience as
well as physical and moral strength.
In the face of all these dangers, I am convinced
that the United Nations and the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization are the strongest and most
effective organizations possible to provide the free
and independence-lovin nations with the greatest
opportunities for self- efense and the preserva-
tion of eaoe.
It is or this reason that Turkey is ﬁghting to
the best of her ability against the subversive
efforts which try to paralyze the one and destroy
the other of these two organizations. According
to our way of thinking, unless the efforts we dedi-
cate towards peace are sincerely reci rocated by
deeds, our desire for peace will only a mirage.
It is obvious that no one can doubt the good
intentions of the communit of free nations.
However, should the policy ollowed be marked
by uncertainty and indecision regardless of our
good faith, then such a course would not only be
uitless but also dangerous.
I am aware that I am 5 aking before the repre-
sentatives of a nation w ich has set an example
to all by the course it has taken and which it will
follow in the preservation of indivisible world
peace in the face of aggressions against the inde-
pendence of nations.
My purpose is merely to emphasize in your
presence here that with a sincere belief in the
righteousness of our common cause, Turkey
thinks along exactly the same lines as do you.

GUISHED owners or Two coumrizs: Tonight, this
com any—this Capital—this country—is honored
by t ie presence at this board of the Head of the
Turkish Republic. We gladly seize the opportu-
nity aﬂ'orded us bv his presence, to salute a nation
which is one of the most gallant and staunchest
defenders of freedom in the modern world.
The evolution of Turkey, taking place within
the span of a single generation, is one of the mar-
vels of our time. Fifty years ago—and there are
a number of us here who can remember that long—
the events, the names, and the faces of Turkey were
little-known to us. ()ur understandin of the
country and its people was very meager indeed.
And then the change. Today we recognize it as
a modern, progressive country, one that we are
proud to ca 1 ally in the at problems that face
the free world toda . gIlleiis great change was
brought about by a (lream of a group of men, a
roup of men headed by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.
ﬁle had a dream that With a band of devoted asso-
ciates they translated into reality—by service, un—
selﬁsh and dedicated service to their country.
Forgetting themselves, they gave their lives and
their talents to the nation to which they belonged.
And since 1923 we see the transformation that
has taken place. Now the great Ataturk is dead,
but his work lives on, and our guest of honor this
evening is one of the original band that worked
with him to bring about t is great change, and to
make Turkey the nation she is today: great, and
growing greater every day.
Our guest of honor, since that day in 1923, has
been almost continuously in the Assembly of his
country. He has held almost every position in
his government, including that of Prime Minister,
and now is honored by holding the highest posi-
tion in the land.
In a feeble effort to show some of the ap recia-
tion of this Government and its people, for 'Purkey
as a nation and its people, our Government has
awarded to our guest of honor the Legion of Merit
in the rade of Chief Commander, the highest
honor t iat this Government can give to anyone in
time of peace not a citizen of this countrv. And
with your permission, I shall read the Citation:
“The President of the United States of America,
authorized by Act of Congress July 20, 1942, has
awarded the Legion of Merit, Degree of Chief
Commander, to Celal Bayar, President of the
Turkish Re ublic, for exceptionally meritorious
conduct in e performance of outstanding serv-
ices:
“The Turkish peo le have shown their conﬁ-
dence in Celal Bayar y entrusting him with high
ofﬁces throu hout his long ublic career, but espe-
cially when e was honoredp by being placed in the
hi best and most res nsible ition in Turkish
pu lic lifehthat of t e Presi ency of the Repub-
ic. In this high office, he has contributed greatly
to the enrichment of that goodwill which charac-
terizes the relationship between Turkey and the
United States. Under his ﬁrm leadership, Turkey
has continued to actively support those ideals
which are cherished by free peoples everywhere,
thus contributing effectively to the hopes for free-
dom and peace throughout the world.”
Now, my friends, as we lift our glasses to our
guest of honor, let us remember that through him
we do so, also, to the great nation of Turkey and
its people—a people whose future we shall watch
with interest, and wish for them everything that
is ood in a free world.
dies and gentlemen, President Bayar of
Turkey.
