in is to be devoted to propa nda on well-known
subjects, and the repetition o charges and counter-
charges, then I doubt very much whether we will
have achieved that relaxation of world tension
which professes to be the ﬁrst point on the agenda
proposed by the Soviet Union.
STATEMENT OF JANUARY 30
This second item of our agenda deals with “the
German question” and also ‘ the problem of insur-
ing European security.” History compels us to
treat these two matters together.
From this very city where we are, still largely
in ruins, have been launched two world wars. Two
of our four countries, France and the Soviet
Union, have suffered land invasion both in World
War I and \Vorld \Var II. The United Kingdom
was invaded by air. All four of us have twice had
to marshal to the full our human and material
resources in order to withstand and ﬁnally to
throw back the tides of German aggression.
Surely we have a vital interest to do all that is
in our power to make sure that such aggressions
should never occur again. Indeed, that concern is
shared by the German people themselves who have
suffered cruelly from militarism and tyranny from
some of their own peo le.
The sacriﬁces whic have been made during
these two world wars have now placed in our hands
a large measure of power to inﬂuence the future,
for better or for worse, and to determine whether
the coming years will preface a durable peace 0r
another disastrous war.
Nine years have now elapsed since the German
armistice, and peace is still unmade. In many
ways, that delay is a reproach to us. But there
is another side to the matter. The immediate
aftermath of a bitter and exhausting war usually
ﬁnds that reason is submerged by sentiments of
hatred and revenge. The instinctive reaction at
that time is to turn to repression as a means to
future safety. But the lapse of time restores rea-
son to its proper place and now, 9 years having
passed, we should be able to invoke wisdom and
statesmanship to be our guides.
The problem that we face here has two major
aspects. First, there is the task of uniting Ger-
many, and secondly, there is the task of insuring
that a united Germany shall be a peaceful Ger-
many. I shall ﬁrst speak of the problem of Ger-
man uniﬁcation.
The partition of German creates a basic source
of instability, and there is ittle merit in our talk-
ing about peace if at the same time we are per-
petuatin conditions which enda er the eace.
I am rmly convinced that a ree an united
Germany is essential to stable peace in Europe and
that it is in the interest of all four nations which
are represented here around this table.
How did it come to ass that there is this dis-
unity—this disunity 0 Germany which is, as I
say, a den er to peace? We here are not free from
responsibi ity in that respect, because it is the
disagreement of our four nations which has created
the present division of Germany. It is the dis-
agreement of our four nations which perpetuates
the present division of German , and it is only we
who can end this division of ermany.
As I ointed out in some earlier remarks that I
made, t at fact—the fact that we four have a
unique responsibility in Germany—should make
this German problem a central theme of our work
here. It can be the test as to whether or not we
are really qualiﬁed to work together for peace.
There exists this partition of Germany which is
a threat to the eace. It is in our power to end it.
All that is nee ed to end it is that we should have
the will to end it. If we do not have that will,
then I say we may be peace-loving nations, but
we are not peace-seeking nations.
Mr. Eden’s Plan
Mr. Eden yesterday submitted a recise and a
detailed lan to achieve the uniﬁcation and free-
dom of ermany by an orderly series of actions
that would start with free elections. It seems to
us that this British proposal is clear, is reasonable,
and is well-designed to achieve at the earliest prac-
tical moment a full German settlement, including
a German peace treaty.
I have no doubt that our discussions here around
the table, as we debate this intricate matter, may
suggest the desirability of some modiﬁcations in
detail of the plan which Mr. Eden has submitted
and perhaps some clariﬁcations. Certainly I
think we must all have an open mind on that, and
I certainly have an open mind. But I do say
that in general I endorse the roposal that has been
submitted on behalf of the nited Kingdom and
associate myself with it.
There are one or two observations which I would
make, particularly sug ested by some remarks that
have been made by Mrﬁrfolotov. Mr. Molotov has,
for example, suggested that the proposal of the
United Kingdom would be in essence an attempt
on the part of the four occupyin powers to im-
pose uniﬁcation upon Germany mﬁier than lettin
the Germans work out their own affairs. As I
read Mr. Eden’s project, it would be just the
contrary.
Under this proposal, the essential steps in the
entire uniﬁcation rocess, including their timing,
are left up to the el elected representatives of
the German e0 1e €Vho is it under this lan
who will draft t s new constitution? It will be
the freely elected representatives of the German
peo le. Who will set up a provisional all-German
aut orit and later on the all-German govern-
ment? The all-German national assembly. Who
decides when powers shall be transferred from
the existing r imes in Eastern and Western Ger-
many to the al -German government, and what in-
