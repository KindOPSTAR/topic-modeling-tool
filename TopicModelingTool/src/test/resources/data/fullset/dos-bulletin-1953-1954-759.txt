The Refugee Relief Program: A Challenge to Voluntary Social Agencies
' by Frank L. Auerbach
Special Assistant to the Director of the Visa Oﬁce ‘
The Refugee Relief Act, which became law with
the President’s signature on August 7, 1953, and
remains in effect until January 1, 1957, attempts
to hel refugees from Communist persecution,
natura disaster, and military operations to come
to the United States as immigrants. It also con-
tributes to the solution of problems resulting from
opulation pressures in Italy, Greece, and Holland
y facilitating the immigration from those coun-
tries of certain close relatives of American citizens
and ermanent resident aliens. In addition, the
act acilitates the immigration of orphans and
permits certain aliens already in the United States
as nonimmigrants to become permanent residents
of the United States. The maximum number of
aliens who may beneﬁt from the act’s provisions
is 214,000.
The important feature of the new act is that it
permits these 214,000 aliens to become ermanent
residents of the United States without eing sub-
ject to the quota limitations of our regular immi-
gration laws. In other words, aliens coming to
the United States under the Refugee Relief Act
may come in addition to those who are permitted
go enter under the Immigration and Nationality
ct.
For the beneﬁt of those who so far have had no
or little contact with the new act, I should like
to summarize brieﬂy its more important provi-
sxons.
There are four distinct grou s of aliens who
may beneﬁt by the act and four distinct procedures
have to be followed. The largest group, 186,000
out of 214,000, are refugees, expellees, and escapees
from Communist persecution, natural disaster,
and military operations, both in Europe and Asia.
Visas to 90,000 of these refugees, escapees, and
expellees may be issued in the German Federal
Republic, the Western Sector of Berlin, or in
Austria; 10,000 in the territory of the member

nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
on the European Continent and in Turkey,
Sweden, Iran, and Trieste; 45,000 in Italy, 15,000
in Greece, 15,000 in Holland, 2,000 in the Near
East, 5,000 in the Far East, and another 2,000
each to Polish veterans and Chinese refugees re-
gardless of their place of residence at the time of
visa application. Refugees within this group
could be escapees from behind the Iron Curtain,
victims of ﬂoods in Holland or of earthquakes in
Greece.
In order to bring a refugee or escapee to the
United States, assurances of employment, housing,
and a ainst becoming a public charge must be
given y citizens of the United States. Special
assurance forms have been prepared by the De-
partment of State which are to be used by citizen
sponsors. Diﬁ'erent assurance forms are to be
used depending on whether the sponsor knows the
alien he wishes to bring to the United States or if
he designates only the skills and qualiﬁcations
such alien should have but relies on a voluntary
social agency or another agent to select for him
an alien having these qualiﬁcations.
The degree to which statements contained in
these assurances have to be corroborated by addi-
tional evidence such as statements from employ-
ers, bank letters, copies of income-tax returns,
et cetera, depends on whether the assurance is
endorsed by one of the voluntary social agencies
recognized for this pur ose. If one of the some 20
recognized agencies un erwrites an assurance pre-
pared by an individual citizen, generally speaking,
the agency’s underwriting relieves the sponsor of
the necessity of rocuring documentation corrob-
orating his public charge and housing assurance.
Italian, Greek, and Dutch Relatives
The second largest roup of aliens beneﬁting
from the Refugee Reiief Act are certain close
relatives of American citizens in Italy, Greece, and
Holland who qualify for preference quota status
under our regular immigration laws. Fifteen
thousand Italian relatives, 2,000 Greek relatives,
