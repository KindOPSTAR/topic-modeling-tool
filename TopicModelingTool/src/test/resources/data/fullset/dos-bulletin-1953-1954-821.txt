try to create a collective security pact in that area.
That eﬁ'ort failed at that time in the sense that we
were not able to put together a collective security
arrangement of any large proportions, and we
ended with a series of separate pacts—one with
Japan, one with Australia and New Zealand, and
another with the Philippines. But there was not
a re ional security pact created at that time.
Then I think I pointed out that, in his great ad-
dress of April 16 of last year, President Eisen-
hower made a statement which did not attract at
the time the attention it deserved perhaps because
of other aspects of his speech where he referred to
Korea and Southeast Asia and said there should
be united action for the defense of Southeast Asia.
I repeated that statement in my March 29
speech "‘ after having previously discussed it with
congressional leaders and with our principal allies.
The general conditions under which the United
States is prepared to participate in collective de-
fense there or elsewhere, for that matter, are quite
well known. We are willing to articipate in col-
lective defense basically upon tiie terms that are
laid down by the Vandenberg Resolution of June
1948, which laid down basic conditions under
which the United States would be prepared to
participate on the basis of mutuality and in ac-
cordance with the principles of the United
Nations.
We are not prepared to go in for a defense of
colonialism. We are only going to go in for de-
fense of liberty and independence and freedom.
We don’t go in alone; we go in where the other
nations which have an important stake in the area
recognize the peril as we do.
We go in where the United Nations gives moral
sanction to our action.
All of those conditions are known. They have
been known. They are a basic part of American
foreign policy, and they are, as the President said
in one of his press conferences, a “stable” element
in the situation.
Mr. Dulles was then asked what was initiated by
this Government in the period between March or
April 0f1953 and May of this year to bring about
a Southeast Asian pact. He replied:
We did have conversations, particularly with
the French and the representatives of the Associ-
ated States who under conditions then existing
were apt to form the core of any defensive action
in that area.
A correspondent recalled that one of the condi-
tions laid down by Mr. Dulles in his speech of May
7 was to give independence to the Associated
States. The correspondent said that France and
Viet-Nam had initialed proposed treaties of inde-
pendence and association. He asked Mr. Dulles
’Ibid., Apr. 12, 1954, p. 539.
how far those treaties go toward meeting this
point. Mr. Dulles made the following reply:
I think what France is doing will, from what
on might call a 'uridical standpoint, be a very
arge step in fulﬁllment of their pledge of July 3
of ast ear of complete inde endence to the Asso-
ciated tates. The main di culty, I would say, at
the present moment is not so much juridical as it
is the translation of le al documents into a sense
on the part of the peop es of Viet-Nam, Laos, and
Cambodia that the really have an inde endence
for which it is worthwhile for them to ﬁg t and, if
need be, to die.
It takes time to translate papers that are signed
in Paris into the living spirit; and it also takes
time to overcome a certain feeling on the part of
many of the Asian nations that France is not
really sincere in its promises. I believe the
French are goin a long way down that path—
perhaps from a egal standpoint as far as it is
either wise or necessary to go at the present time.
But it is one thing to have the letter and another
thing to have the spirit and I would say at the
moment the principal deficiency is a translation of
the spirit of liberty into the area and in the con-
duct of the French people in relation to the native
e0 les. There is quite a bit to be done, I think,
1n t at practical respect.
A reporter cited as one of the general conditions
for participation a place where the United Nations
gives moral sanction. He asked if the United
States had any plans for seeking that kind of
sanction from the United Nations. Mr. Dulles
answered :
There have been discussions 011' and on, I am
sorry to say more off than on, over the past year
or more with reference to bringing the United
Nations into this situation. At the moment the
prospects look somewhat better than they have
recently, but in the past we have been very close
to the United Nations action without its being
actually taken. So I don’t want to forecast at the
present time.
Asked if we would support any appeal to the
United Nations for a peace mission or observation
mission to be sent into the Southeast Asian arm,
he replied:
I believe if such an appeal were made, the United
States would support It.
ler. Dulles was asked if the United States had
before it any request from the French Government
for intervention in Indochina. He replied:
No, the French Government has made no such
request of the United States. They have had
some conversations to explore the conditions under
which that might be possible, and in that respect
the French have been told much the same thing
