and also it sought to grab some more.” Not only
the conferees in Berlin but a listenin world
learned the nature and shape of todays Soviet
policy. Revealed in its true pro ortions, that
policy had no t-Stalin “new 100 ”, unless you
could so term t e fear of freedom implicit in its
every detail.
Reglonal Grouplngs and Free World Defense
To the anti-Communist world, the results of the
test of Soviet intentions which was made at Ber-
lin have deep signiﬁcance. The uncha ed Soviet
tenets strongly accent the need for e ective re-
gional security arrangements. Further the Soviet
attitude underscores the desirability of an inter-
lock between regional organizations wherever
practical so that there may be maximum coordi-
nation on securit matters.
As the Presi ent recently stated, “regional
groups to ensure security against aggression con-
stitute the most effective means to assure survival
and progress.”
As friends of Greece we all know about the role
that the Greek nation has played in the European
regional defensive organization. The inclusion
of Greece in NATO substantially increased the
forces available to dissuade a gression. These
forces, which have demonstrate their bravery in
Korea, have been joined with the Southeast Euro-
pean Land Force Command, where alon with
their Turkish neighbors they stand guar over
the strategic ﬂank of the NATO defense system.
Regional collective security, in which Greece
has shown its ﬁrm belief, has made impressive
strides forward in Euro . Individual national
armies have been consoliggted into a coordinated
force. Individual defense plans have ained in
strepgth through overall planning for efense of
the ATO area as a whole. The doubts and qualms
of isolated action have been dispelled and re-
laced by the will to ﬁght for common causes.
ear by year N ATO grows stronger.
Greece has also played a leading role in develop-
ing a new regional grouping in an area where
traditional distrust and historical rivalries have
frequently in the past ﬂared into armed conﬂict.
I refer to the Greek-Turkish-Yugoslav Treaty of
Cooperation signed in Ankara on Februa 28 of
last year. By this realistic and statesman ike ac-
tion three contiguous nations bordering on the
Soviet empire have made clear to the world, and
served notice to the satellites, that they recognize
their mutuality of interest in security matters
and are in a position to work together harmoni-
ously in the event of unprovoked aggression. This
rapprochement certainly represents an element of
strength in a vital area, and the resultant pact,
with its provision for the adherence of other like-
minded nations in that part of the world, should
prove a valuable deterrent to any aggrwsive in-
tentions from the Balkan countries to the north.
If we look to the east of Greece, in that area
that we losely term the Middle East, I am lad
to report that here, as well, there seems to go a
growmg interest in the kind of regional defense
that Berlin showed to be essential.
The United States has long been concerned
about the defense of the Middle East. That con-
cern has increased of late to a point where it might
be called a major preoccupation of the adminis-
tration. There has also been a gradual increase
in public awareness of the immense importance
of the Middle East, both from the oint of view
of an appreciation of the human an material re
sources of the area as well as its strategic location.
All efforts to see the states in the area, and those
nations of the free world who were in a position
to help in the defense of the Middle East, join to-
ther in a common defense organization have
ailed. This has been true primarily because of
the extreme sensitivity of newly independent na-
tions over their sovereignty and because of their
preoccupation with other issues.
This situation was recognized by the Secretary
of State last June when he returned from his trip
through that area. The Secretary stressed that
while a regional defense grouping would in our
opinion be beneﬁcial to the Middle East, the
people of the area themselves should initiate the
arrangement out of a sense of common destiny and
common danger. He further stated that the
United States while awaiting such developments
would help where it could to strengthen the de-
fenses of t ose countries who wanted strength, not
as against each other or the West, but to resist the
common threat to all free peo les.
These ideas reﬂect the po icy of the United
States as it has developed since the visit by the
Secretar to the Middle East some 9 months ago.
What is eing said now is in the nature of a prog-
ress report along these lines. It is, moreover,
progress of the best possible kind, in which free
nations of their own volition have taken steps for
their own welfare, and which coincide with what
we consider to be the welfare of the United States.
On February 19, Turkey and Pakistan an-
nounced their intention to study methods of
achieving closer collaboration between their coun-
tries, includin means designed to strengthen
peace and security.2 This move has iven real im-
petus to the hope for an effective efense of the
area as a whole. It is, in my opinion, the most
far-reachin and important constructive step in
the Middle ast since I have been charged with
my present res onsibility. This Government
warmly welcome this move by Turkey and Pak-
istan. The President responded shortly there-
after with a statement that we were ready to re-
spond affirmatively to Pakistan’s request for as-
sistance in strengthening her own defenses.a
