With the advent of various technical develo -
ments relatin to atomic power and with t a
greater availa ility of raw materials and ﬁssion-
able materials, the time has arrived for modiﬁca-
tion of the existing atomic energy legislation to
encourage wider participation by private in-
dustry and by other public and private groups in
this country in the development of this new and
uniquely attractive energy source for peaceful
purposes. Such widespread participation will be
a stnnulatin and leavening force in this impor-
tant ﬁeld an will be consistent with the best tradi-
tions of American industrial development. The
congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy
last summer held ublic hearings whi have
served a most usefu purpose of identifying and
developin both the problems and the opportu-
nities which emerge as reparations are made
to depart from the Federal, Government’s existing
monopoly in this ﬁeld. Legislation is being rec-
ommended to the Congress which would encour-
fage such participation and yet retain in the
ederal Government the necessary controls over
this awesome force.
Further amendment of the Atomic Ener Act
is needed also to enable us to realize the ful value
of our atomic ener development for the defense
of the free world. shall recommend amendments
which would permit, with adequate saf ards,
a greater degree of exchange 0 classiﬁ infor-
mation with our allies, in order to strengthen
their military defenses—as already mentioned—
and to enable them to participate more fully in
the development of atomic power for peacetime
purposes. I shall recommend also an amend-
ment which would permit the transfer of ﬁs-
sionable material to friendly nations to assist
them in eacetime atomic power development,
particular y those nations which are supplying
us with uranium raw materials. This propose
amendment, as well as the previousl mentioned
amendment, will rovide ade uate sai’e ards for
the security of the United tates. ese legis-
lative recommcndations are independent of my
recent proposal for the establishment of an inter-
national agency to advance the peacetime bene-
ﬁts of atomic energy, for which additional legis-
lation would be needed.
It is now feasible to plan to terminate Federal
ownership and operation of the towns of Oak
Ridge, Tennessee, and Richland, Washington. To
enable the citizens of these communities to man-
age their own affairs in a more normal fashion,
legislation will be recommended which would per-
mit them to purchase their own homes and to
establish self-government in these communities.
itoelrplllnl of Stratellc and
Critical Materials
Considerable progress has been made in the
fulﬁllment of the national stockpile goals, and
further substantial progress is expected during
the ﬁscal year 1955. By the end of 1955 about
50 of the 73 materials objectives will be virtually
completed. Consequently, expenditures will de-
cline sharply from $919 million in 1953 to $770
million in 1954 and $585 million in 1955. The
total value of all stock ile objectives is estimated
at $7.2 billion, of whic about 5.5 billion will be
on hand by June 30, 1955, to meet industrial and
mobilization requirements in times of emergency.
In addition to these direct expenditures from
stockpile appropriations, the borrowing authority
provided under the Defense Production Act, dis-
cussed in the ﬁnance, commerce, and industry sec-
tion of this message, is used primarily for expand-
ing the supply of critical materials. Net expendi-
tures under this authority are estimated at $381
million in the ﬁscal year 1954 and $308 million in
1955. Therefore, a total of nearly $900 million
will be spent in the ﬁscal year 1955 to assure an
adequate supply of critical materials in the event
of an emergency.
INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AND FINANCE
My budget recommendations for the interna-
tional programs of the Government will enable
us to hold our newly won initiative in world af-
fairs and move toward a lasting peace. The
budget for international affairs and ﬁnance in-
cludes funds required for the conduct of our for-
eign aﬂ'airs, for the programs for economic and
technical develo ment abroad, and for our foreign
information an exchange program.
The mutual military rogram, which was for-
merly included in the budget along with these
programs under the headin “International se-
curit and foreign relations” as been discussed in
this udget message as part of the national se-
curity program. At the same time, military as-
sistance is intimately related to and must be ad-
ministered in the furtherance of our foreign
policy.
The extent of our assistance under both the
mutual military program and mutual economic
and technical program is shown in a summary
table below. This table covers all components of
the present mutual security program. This entire
program is directed toward the establishment of
conditions overseas which, in one way or another,
contribute to our own security and well-being.
Our national security and international pro—
grams are designed to deter would-be aggressors
against the United States and other nations of the
free world, and to strengthen our eﬁ'orts for peace
by all appropriate means including diplomatic
negotiations with the Soviets. With a position of
strength, an effective conduct of our foreign rela-
tions by the Department of State is the keystone
of our eﬁ'orts to win our way to peace. There has
