I am, as perhaps you know, a former member
of Congress. As such I think I can, perhaps,
appreciate better than most what President Eisen-
hower’s determination to cooperate with Congress
in the formulation of his policies has meant.
As a member, now, of the executive branch of
the Government I can see, too, how diﬂicult it is
at times to make the contact. But it is being
done. I have, for exam le, spoken of the co-
0 erative efforts of the resident and Senator
'iley to ut across the St. Lawrence Seaway
project. ther Presidents have been interested
1n this project. Other Con sses have considered
the proposal. I heard it iscussed and debated,
off and on, throughout my 6 years in Congress,
and it was a veteran when I arrived.
Teamwork between the “Hill” and the White
House did it. The project has now passed the
Senate and has been favorably reported by the
House committee. I anticipate prompt and fa-
vorable action b the House. I had a personal
experience with t iis teamwork last summer. Con-
s was in recess. There was an emergency.
omething had to be done. The President had
the legal authority to act, but he wanted more
than that. So he sent us, his lieutenants, out.
Harold Stassen, as I remember, went North. I
went South. Others scattered to the East and
West. We rounded u the congressional leaders
and explained what t e President wanted to do.
In 36 hours we had won not only their consent
but approval. There were no arguments when
Congress reconvened as to the wisdom of the step
taken.
The foreign policies adopted under the “new
look” have been and are being discussed with con-
gressional leaders. They are being and will be
debated on the ﬂoors of both the Senate and House.
Secretary Dulles, himself, will make three appear-
ances early next week before congressional groups
to discuss the new policies.
And that is the way we want it. This is an
American policy. It must have America’s sup-
ort.
p These are our olicies in “today’s world”—to
quote from the tit e of this s eech. They are ﬁtted
to the demands of today. T iey are building, how-
ever, the foundation of tomorrow—the tomorrow
we all want of permanent peace and increasing
pros erity.
A1 of us will share in the beneﬁts of that to-
morrow. In the United States all of us want a
part in its construction. You can do your part if
you give us your help in explaining new policies,
the causes that have brought them into being, and
the objectives they seek to attain.
It will not be possible, of course, to “blueprint”
each exact step to be taken under the new policies.
Actually one of the important features of the
policy is that it is not rigid. Its greatest strength
is its ﬂexibility.
Nor do I think you would wish to see publicized
such a “blueprint”, conceding one existed. I can
imagine no greater service to the Soviets. They,
indeed, would like to know exactly what is planned
under every possible situation.
But the overall strate has been announced.
You can hel in seeing it is given wide publicity.
We, the 0 cials of your Government, ask your
cooperation in the task.
Estonian Independence Day
Press release 91 dated February 23
Following is the tewt of a statement by See-
retary D'ul es on the occasion of Estonian Inde-
pendence Day, observed on February 24:
In proclaiming American independence when
our population was little more than 31/2 million,
our forefathers never doubted the right of the
American nation to be free, or the equal right of
other nations, large or small, to the same measure
of freedom. The princi le of the sovereign equal-
ity of all states, regard ess of size, is today em-
bodied in the Charter of the United Nations.
It is appropriate that we reafﬁrm, on this 36th
anniversary of Estonia’s Declaration of Inde-
endence, our deepest sympathy and admiration
or the Estonian people who have been forcibly
deprived of their personal liberty and their na-
tional independence. The restoration of the in-
dependence of those who have lost it remains the
constant concern of the U.S. Government. Only
when res ect for the ri hts of small nations is
universal y respected wi 1 all nations know true
peace and security.
