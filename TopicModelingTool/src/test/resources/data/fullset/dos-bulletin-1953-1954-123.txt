Rather more than half of these loans were ﬁnanced
from ERP Counter art Funds. and the remainder
throu h the Allie Military Government budget.

The Zone’s ﬁnances continued to improve.
The satisfactory position of the “ordinary” budget
was achieved in spite of pay increases awarded
to all statal em )loyees in June 1952. These in-
creases ranged rom 5% to 45%, and were retro-
active to 1 July 1951. “Extraordinary” expend-
iture in the form of housing subsidies and loans
to industry and public utilities continued at 9.
hi h level.
e ﬁnal deﬁcit for the ﬁrst half year of 1952
which was underwritten by the Italian Govern-
ment amounted to 4,651 million lire. This was
some 841 million lire less than originally esti-
mated. The Italian Government’s contribution
included 1,001 million lire as a special grant to
the Trieste shipbuilding programme, and 4,292
million lire representing the net difference be-
tween revenue collected in the British-United
States Zone on behalf of the Italian Re ublic and
revenue collected in Italy on behalf 0 the Zone.
The difference between the ﬁnal deﬁcit and the
Italian Government’s contributions was repre-
sented b increased revenues and economies in
prior budgetary periods.
The estimated deﬁcit for the second half year
of 1952 was 5,760 million lire, an increase of 500
million lire over the comparable ﬁgure for 1951.
-In addition the Italian Treasury provided some
712 million lire as a subsidy to shipbuilding.
There was a further marked increase in sav-
ings during the year. A table showing the posi-
tion of deposits and current accounts with the
banks and post ofﬁce compared with 1951 is at

1952 is shown at A pendix E, and that for the

Sectlon Ill—Industry
1. GENERAL
There was a further increase in industrial pro-
duction in the Zone during 1953, the index (1939=
100) rising from 113.7 in 1951 to 127.9 in 1952.
This increase was shared geiierall among the
Zone’s major industries, with the nota le exception
of the vegetable oil reﬁneries which continued to
experience difﬁculty in obtaining raw industries.
Modernisation of the plants of the ILVA Steel Mill,
the A iiila Oil Reﬁnery and the Trieste Jute Mill,
was a most completed and their output rose ac-
cordingly.
2. lAULE INDUSTRIAL AREA
The process of broadening the base of the Zone’s
economv, which is at present largely dependent on
shipbuilding and on trafﬁc through the Port, was
continued. Pro 7 ess was most conspicuous in the
Zaule Industria Area. The ﬁrst public works
programme, designed to prepare this area for the
reception and development of new industries, was
completed, and the second programme, comple-
mentary to the ﬁrst, was started. During the year,
394 million lire were made available by the Allied
Military Government for the general development
of the area, raising to 1,645 million lire, the total
funds appropriated for this project since its in-
ception.
At the end of the year there were 26 industries
already operating or in course of completion in
the area, with a total capital investment of over
13,000 million lire. Among those whose construc-
tion was started durin the year were the S. Giusto
Cotton Mill and the Trieste Glass Works, while
work continued on the Italcementi Cement Works,
a match factory and a wool s inning mill. The
construction of a further six iimts is planned for
the near future with a capita investment of about
3,000 million lire.
The shipbuilding industry experienced a suc-
cessful year, although the total tonnage con-
structed was lower than that of 1951. The only
major vessel to be completed during 1952 was the
25,000 ton passen er-cargo motor vessel “Augus-
tus” which was elivered to the Italia Line in
February. The ﬁttin out of the passenger-
cargo motor vessels “ ictoria” and “Asia” each
of 11,600 tons, for Lloyd Triestino, continued.
The tanker “Andromena” of 12,300 tons, for
A. G. I. P. Rome, was launched in August, and the
keel of a 21,000 ton tanker for F.lli. d’Amico,
Rome, was laid in September. The keels of a
further 18 smaller vessels were laid, ten were
