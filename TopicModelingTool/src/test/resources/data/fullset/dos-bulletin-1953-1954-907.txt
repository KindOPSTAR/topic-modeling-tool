a.—
the coastwise trade of Brazil. Moreover, United
States ships cannot operate in the Brazilian coastal
trade since Brazil has coastal laws similar to ours
in that regard. Consequently, such vessels W111
not be in competition with vessels operated by
United States shipping lines operating to Brazil.
On the contrary, Brazil will Use these vessels for
feeder services in moving cargo from the smaller
ports, many of which are maccessible to the deeper
draft United States ocean going ships, to the
larger ports. This will contribute to the expand-
ing of Brazilian economy and trade which Will be
shared by United States ﬂag vessels.
The Department has no objection to the amend-
ment as proposed by the American Merchant
Marine Institute relating to the sale of privately
owned Cl-MAV—l type vessels to Brazil at prices
equal to or less than, and upon credit terms Slmilar
to, those speciﬁed in the original bill.
The Department also believes the same comment
applies to the osition as taken by the Association
of American S ip Owners with respect to its state-
ment that rospective purchasers of ships should
purchase t em from private owners in the private
market.
In reference to the opposition of the Shipbuild-
ers Council of America to S. 2370, it should be
ointed out that the bill if enacted would result
1n considerable work being done in United States
shi ping yards on the vessels purchased from the
lai up ﬂeet in putting such vessels into class, in
accordance with the minimum requirements of the
American Bureau of Shipping.
A further advantage to United States indus-
tries very closely allied with shipbuilding is the
fact that during the lives of these ships all spare
parts and replacements for main engines and
auxiliary machinery must be purchased from the
United States manufacturers. Brazilians are
highly pleased with the American diesels in the
ships of this type which they are presently oper-
ating, and it would appear good policy to try to
keep this important market for United States
engine builders.
This legislation could not, therefore, adversely
affect the American Merchant Marine.
In the State Department’s opinion the passage
of this bill, along with the carrying out of the
other parts of the program, will be exceedingly
helpful in promoting good shipping relations be-
tween the United States and Brazil.
