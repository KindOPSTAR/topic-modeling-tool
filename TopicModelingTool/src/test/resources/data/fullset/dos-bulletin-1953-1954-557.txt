engineering, and regional-development specialists,
under the direction of a prominent New York ﬁrm
of management consultants, to go to Germany
to review the Berlin situation. The report of this
team in December 1952 conﬁrmed the U.S. view
that future expansion of emplo ent called for
more emphasis on consumer goo s, better market-
ing methods, and management training.2 _ _
To achieve the goal of addition to capacity, it
was recommended that counterpart be used to ro-
vide equity ﬁnancing as well as loan funds. 1113
was considered of particular importance because
of the difﬁculty of getting private venture capital
into West Berlin and because of the thin equity
position of many ﬁrms. Practical developments
such as this recommendation had to wait on lon
negotiations because of a failure on the part 0
some to understand the usefulness of such ﬁnanc-
ing. The Germans have tended to follow tra-
ditionally conservative bankin practices and have
hesitated to adopt new proce ures. This hesita-
tion may be attributable to earlier inﬂationary ex-
periences and to the fact that the German banking
structure found itself prostrate at the end of the
war and Berlin banks are even still hard pressed
for the necessary liquidity to assure adequate pri-
vate medium and long-term capital. The Equity
Financing Program was initiated, however, in
June 1953 with the agreement to devote DM 100
million of U.S. counterpart to equity programs to
be administered through the Berlin Industrie
Bank. This type of aid is particularly desirable at
this time. It is a source of risk capital which can
be advanced to small ﬁrms and new business, and
thus provides more jobs for the funds invested than
the heavier industries, with larger overhead ex-
penses.
The Berlln Work Rellet Program
Berlin’s Work Relief Program has, since the
winter of 1950, served the dual pur ose of pro-
viding work for the unemployed and nancing for
some investments of long-term economic useful-
ness which could not be privately ﬁnanced. Ex~
penditures on Berlin work relief between April
1950, when the program ﬁrst began, and March
1954 total approximately DM 863 million, with
contributions from U.S. counterpart totalling DM
535 million, or approximately 60 percent. More
than half of the total amount spent was used for
productive projects such as housing, construction
of commercial and industrial buildings, and public
utilities. A quarter of the total was used for
rubble clearance; 11 percent was used for govern-
ment construction work, and 7 percent for the cre-
ation of jobs for apprentices and white-collar
workers.
’ For a summary of proposals based on this report, see
BULLETIN of Mar. 2, 1953, p. 328.
During the course of the Work Relief Program,
three signiﬁcant developments have taken place:
1) The program has become increasingly more
productive in that less emphasis has been placed on
merely keeping the greatest number of people
occupied.
2) The Germans have borne an increasing pro-
ortion of the cost of the program. This is shown
y the fact that up roximately 85 percent of the
cost of the ﬁrst wor relief program was ﬁnanced
out of U.S. counter art, whereas U.S. counterpart
is ﬁnancing only a ut 37 percent of the 1953—54
program.
3) As the Berlin economic situation has grad-
ually improved, yearly expenditures for work
relief have varied from DM 270 million in 1951
to DM 161 million in 1953—54, and may rise slightly
above this ﬁgure in 1954—55.
The Berlin Government has outlined a new
Work Relief Program for the German ﬁscal year
beginning April 1, 1954. Included in this pro-
gram are such projects as housing construction
and repair, commercial construction, roads, water-
ways, rubble clearance, parks, ardens, and proj-
ects to employ white-collar wor ers.
Federal Republic Aid to Berlln
Since it came into being in September 1949,
the Federal Republic of Germany has 5 ent about
DM 3.6 billion ($859 million) on beha f of Ber-
lin. The Federal Republic’s contribution to Ber-
lin in 1953—54 will be about one and a half billion
DM ($360 million), of which DM 650 million was
contributed to underwrite the Berlin budget
deﬁcit. The Federal Re ublic has also granted
certain tax privileges to erlin to stimulate the
roduction and sale of Berlin goods. The West
'German Cabinet appointed a Federal Deputy
whose special respons1bility is the promotion of the
Berlin economy. The Federal Deputy for Berlin,
together with the Berlin Marketing Council es-
tablished by the Berlin business community to (pro-
mote trade development and partially ﬁnance by
U.S. counterpart, have concentrated their efforts
on securing orders for Berlin both from Western
Germany and from abroad. The Federal Rail-
ways and the Post Ofﬁce, for example, place large
orders in Berlin each year.
The Federal Republic has also received in its
various Laender (states) the greater part of the
300,000 refugees who ﬂed into Berlin from East
Germany in 1953, and has assisted in lifting the
relief burden from the city. Speaking in Berlin
on February 23, in the wake of the Four Power
Conference which failed to secure the hoped-for
reuniﬁcation of Germany, Chancellor Adenauer
in the course of a special trip to Berlin promised
to continue and increase measures of support for
the city.
