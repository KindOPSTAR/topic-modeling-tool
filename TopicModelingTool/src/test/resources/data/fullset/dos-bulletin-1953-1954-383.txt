The Signiﬁcance of the Berlin Conference
by Walter P. McUomughy '
Director of the Ofﬁce of Chinese Affairs
After 31/ weeks of arduous activity at Berlin it
is good to be able to talk in the relaxed and sym-
pathetic atmosphere of this forum about what
appened at Berlin and what it signiﬁes for us.
e topics discussed at Berlin ranged far and
wide. One verse of a ditty current at the Con-
ference which was attributed to an “obscure mem-
ber of the British delegation” went this way, to the
tune of “Lili Marlene’ :
Please, Mr. Ministers, can't we leave the rest?
We've polished of! Albania and now we’re on Trieste;
We have discussed the munitions race and next on
Molly's list is space;
We have exhausted Item One
And the Commies, they've Just begun,
Oh please, can‘t we go home?
on please, can’t we go home?
I hope we can narrow the ﬁeld somewhat here
tonight and dwell on a few considerations which
seem to me most signiﬁcant.
It is an added evidence of the to sy-turvy be-
havior of the Soviet Union that t e Far East
loomed lar in a conference which was called to
deal with t e purely European questions of Ger-
many and Austria. Far Eastern issues were
raised by Mr. Molotov in his opening speech on
the ﬁrst day of the Conference, January 25, and
they came up intermittentl throughout the Con-
ference u to its closing hour on February 18.
Perhaps will be excused if in these remarks I
've a somewhat dis roportionate emphasis to the
ar Eastern phase, ecause of my special concern
with that art of the world.
First I s ould like to give you a vignette of the
scene in the conference room where the plenary
sessions were held. The layout was similar in
both meeting places—the Allied Control Author-
ity Building in the Western Sector, and the Soviet
Embassy on Unter Den Linden in the Eastern
Sector. Four long tables were arranged in a

uare, with one side allotted to each delegation.
T e ﬁve rankin members of each delegation were
seated at the ta le. Behind each delegation were
seated its advisers in two, three, or four rows.
When a moot point came up which required check-
ing, there was often a great scurrying about in the

W1se around the room from the U.S. de egation
there were the French, the British (opposne the
Americans) and the Soviets (opposite the
French).
Each Minister spoke in his own language. Each
set speech was then translated consecutivel into
the other two languages. This necessarily re-
tarded the pace of the proceedings. Extempora-
neous remarks were translated simultaneously into
the other languages by expert interpreters Sitting
in sound roof booths, w ose microphones were
connecte with earphones available to the dele -
tion members. The Soviets had the largest d5:-
gation, and they needed it.
Mr. Molotov realized from the outset that he
had a diﬂicult role to playA and that he would be
hard put to it to disguise is rejection of the uni-
ﬁcation of a free Germany and the Austrian State
Treaty. He decided this could best be done b
adopting an air of “sweet reasonableness.” e
injected into his voice a slight inﬂection of gentle
remonstrance. His air was one of mild expostula-
tion, of restrained impatience that the “modera-
