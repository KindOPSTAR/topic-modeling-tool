REFUTATION 0F SOVIET CHARGES
U.S./U.N. press release 1911 dated April 27
I feel impelled to take a few minutes of the
Council again to set the record straight. I feel
that charges were made by the delegate from
Soviet Russia against my country which were not
facts, which were slanders, and I think we should
refer to the record to get the matter completely
straight.
I take his charges one by one. In the ﬁrst in-
stance, he stated that the Ad H00 Committee ap-
pointed to investigate conditions of forced labor
throughout the world was a stacked Committee,
a Committee that was stacked, and he im lied
that it was stacked against Soviet Russia an her
satellites. Well, who are the members of the
Committee? They were three eminent jurists.
And what countries did they come from? They
came from India, Norway, and Peru, as we all
know. Now, is there any implication in that
makeup of a Committee that it should be stacked
for or against any country that is represented
around this table or is represented in the United
Nations? By any stretch of the imagination
was there any attempt to stack that Committee
or to make its ﬁndings favor or disfavor any one
country or oup of countries? No. It was a
thoroughly impartial job done b an eminent
group of jurists who were dedicate to one thing,
and that was to ﬁnd the facts.
The Soviet delegate also said that the United
States was the main speaker and he said that I
asked why do we have to discuss forced labor.
That is correct. I asked that question and again
I refer to the record and here is my answer. I
said, “We must discuss the facts fairly and
frankly. For we have before us the report of
the Ad Hoc Committee.”
The Soviet delegate quoted at length from the
statements of one Stetson Kennedy as his only
source of information. It so happens that the
Ad H 00 Committee examined the charges of Stet-
son Kennedy. They went through them thor-
oughly and the record shows the extent of the
examination. And what did they do with the
charges? They dismissed them as unfounded. I
refer. ou to that report and I would suggest to
the de ate from Russia that he read the report.
The Séiviet representative next referred to wet-
backs. Well, now, there has been some inference
around this table on two occasions that wetbacks
were something in the United States that people
did not like to talk about. \Vell, it happens that
I live only 100 miles north of the Mexican border
and I spend quite a little time occasionally in
Mexico. I know what wetbacks are and I know
Mexico because Mexicans are as ﬁne neighbors as
any country could possibly want to have.
Now, what are wetbacks? Wetbacks are Mex-
ican nationals who seek to come into the United
States to work on farms voluntarily in order to
et the higher wages that happen to ertain in
t e United States. That is all a wetbac is. The
arrangements with regard to legal immigration—
the arrangements between the great Republic of
Mexico, our neighbor on the south, and the United
States—are thoroughly incorporated in the treaty
and agreement dated March 10, 1954, which has
been released to the ublic. I would refer the
delegate from Soviet ussia to read that agree-
ment.
A wetback, who is an illegal immigrant, is a
man that is just as free as any citizen of the United
States. He does not happen to be a citizen of the
United States but he would like to come into the
United States to get work. Of course, we have
visa laws and we have to have visas. People have
to have visas to come in from the outside and we
have to see that those visas are pro erly honored.
It is the machinery with regard to this with which
the agreement between the Republic of Mexico
and the United States deals. We are glad to have
legal Mexican workers. The can go back any
time they want. They get t e going wages on
the farms. They are stayinﬁ here within the
length of time that they are a owed to stay here
an then the are supposed to go back to Mexico.
They do not ave to stay here. They can go back
beforehand. I just wanted to clear that up be-
cause this has been mentioned several times and
I happen to know what wetbacks are.
The Soviet representative also stated that these
wetbacks are paid 20 cents an hour. Now, that
is erfectly foolish. Do on think the great Re-
pu lic of Mexico would allow any of her nationals
to come over here and work for wages that were
less than comparable labor would command in
the United States and then would be enslaved by
any other country? Would any of you sitting
around this table allow any of your nationals to
go to any other country and work there under
supposed (y alleged bad conditions and be aid low
wages an kept there under duress? 0 course,
you would not.
The Soviet representative then stated that in
some conference, some meeting somewhere—I did
not get exactly where—the United States voted
against the right to strike. I did not know what
he was talking about, but I would only answer
that by asking him how many strikes do you have
in the Soviet Union in any one year as compared
to the strikes in the United States? Mind you.
no one is proud of strikes; no one in the United
States wants strikes. But the inherent right of
the working man in the United States is to strike
and with men as they are you are bound to have
differences occasionally. Have you ever read of
a strike in the Soviet Union? I haven’t.
The Soviet representative next quoted a state-
ment of ex-Secretary of Labor Durkin of the
United States, and he based his comment on an
article in the American Mercury which referred
to an article by Mr. Durkin in the January 1954
May 24, 1954
