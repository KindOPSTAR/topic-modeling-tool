great power, will not in our view even attend as a
government. At Berlin we secured Soviet agree-
ment to the following statement:
It is understood that neither the invitation to, nor the
holding of, the above-mentioned conference shall be
deemed to imply diplomatic recognition in any case where
it has not already been accorded.
The time, place, and composition of the Korean
Political Conference are entirely as we wanted.
We do not fear this conference. As Secretary
Dulles has said,
There is . . . no reason why we should refuse to seek
peacefully the results we want merely because of fear
that we will be outmaneuvered at the conference
table. . . . Our cause is not so poor, and our capacity
not so low, that our Nation must seek security by sulking
in its tent.
We will not be prepared at Geneva to allow the
aggressors to achieve at the conference table what
they failed to achieve in battle. This applies not
only to territorial considerations but to any “deal”
which would, as has been suggested in some quar-
ters, trade a United Nations seat and an end to
the trade controls for an agreement by Communist
China to stop supplying the Viet Minh. As a re-
cent New York Times editorial put it,
There is neither logic nor proﬁt in paying a bribe to the
Communists to get their worthless promise not to do again
what they had no business doing in the ﬁrst place.
U.S. Approach to Geneva Conference
Whatever the Communist attitude, we will go
to Geneva in good faith and do our best to achieve
'ust solutions to the Korean and Indochinese prob-
ems. There is the bare possibility that Soviet
Russia and its Chinese Communist ally may be
sufﬁciently preoccupied with plans for internal
development to cause them at least to desire a
riod of relaxation in both areas on an acceptable
asis. Meanwhile, we are keenl sensible to the
Communist habit of waging war y cease-ﬁre and
do not discount the possibility that they might
use a cessation of hostilities merely as an oppor-
tunity to build up for renewed attacks. In our
view, any settlement in Korea or Indochina would
have to rovide effective guarantees against such
a possibility.
Certainly we do not contemplate any action
at Geneva or anywhere else which would damage
the cause of the Government of the Republic of
China. Our policy is to extend moral and mate-
rial support to the Free Chinese, and we have no
intention of letting them down. Their Govern-
ment has been constant in its opposition to lawless
imperialism. We do not forget that the Govern-
ment of China under President Chiang Kai-shek,
during the long years of its lone stand against the
Japanese invader, had several opportunities to
reach a seemingly advantageous accommodation
with the invading power, but refused to do so.
The Chinese Government early recognized the true
complexion of the Chinese Communists and re—
fused to compromise with them. Just as we view
the unswerving friendship of the Chinese Govern-
ment with gratitude, we also view its growth in
material strength and political ap eal with satis-
faction. VVe are pre ared to len our continued
support to these en 5, but we cannot ourselves
fashion them. This, of course, is primarily a
Chinese responsibility. The military and eco-
nomic progress which has taken place on Formosa
during the past 4 years has been heartening. We
hope and are conﬁdent that the pro ess which
the Free Chinese are making will stan in increas-
ingly favorable contrast to the regimentation and
op ression of the mainland regime.
e will continue military and economic aid
to the Government of Free China. We will con-
tinue to recognize it as the Government of China
and we will support it as the representative of
China in the United Nations. We are convinced
that even though it is cut off from the mainland,
it is far more representative of the will of the
Chinese people than is the Peipin regime. It
has conducted itself in the United ations ably,
responsibly, and with dignity. The free world
can deal With this Government on mutually un-
derstandable terms. It does not employ the
upside-down vocabulary of the Communists.
International politics, like domestic olitics, is
in the last analysis an art of the possible. I do
not mean by this that a solution to “the China
problem” is impossible. I mean that the solution
is not likely to be easy or quick. Time, however,
can be on our side. The greatest thin the Com-
munists have to fear is truth. This ear erected
both the Iron Curtain and the Bamboo Curtain.
There is nothing new about communism, and we
know that it is by no means “the inevitable wave
of the future.” It has been tried for a long time
and has proven itself totally incapable of making
good on its promises. We are resolved to remain
strong in order to have the time to demonstrate,
beyond the ower of curtains to hide, the simple
truth that t e systems fashioned b free men can
tap the energies and meet the nee s of their peo-
ples incomparably better than can a. materialistic
and cynical system of coercion and re 'mentation.
This truth must yet make millions ree who are
now enslaved, including the Chinese on the
mainland.
The course which we are now pursuin with
respect to China may not be easy or qnic , but
we must never for one moment doubt the possi-
bility of reaching our objectives with honor and
with a full sense of our responsibility to this and
to future generations. In this let us not seek the
counsel either of the timid or of the foolhardy.
We feel strongly about the China problem because
it affects not only our security but the very valum
by which we live. If we stand honestly on those
principles which have brought us thus far, we
need not fear that we shall have to stand alone.
