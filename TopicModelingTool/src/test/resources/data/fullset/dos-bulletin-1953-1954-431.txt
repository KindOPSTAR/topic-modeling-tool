each year and general] makes recommendations
to one or more of them. Their budgets are
examined each year by the United Nations Ad-
visor Committee on Administrative and Budget-
ary uestions. And the United Nations Secre-
tary-General does preside over a committee on
administrative coordination consisting of the
directors of the agencies.
But speaking frankly and realistically, the
specialized agencies are, for practical purposes,
inde endent. This has been the source of many
trou les. In past years, for example, the public-
ity coming from one specialized agency had a
signiﬁcant and understandably irritating effect on
a sizeable number of Americans, with reactions
which damaged the United Nations proper and
which rejudiced some of the ﬁne work actually
being one by the specialized agencies. Screen-
ing of U.S. employees of international organiza-
tions, to give another example, even though the
agreement of the United Nations Secretary-Gen-
era] was obtained, had to be ne otiated separately
with each agency—an immense y time-consuming
procedure. I therefore would raise with you the
(pliestion as to whether the present provisions of
t e United Nations Charter are adequate for the
sort of coordination we want and, if not, whether
the system of coordination should be improved,
and, if so, by changes in the Charter.
U.N. Support by Members
While charter review is important and could
do a great deal to make the United Nations more
effective, we should never lose sight of the fact
that the success of the United Nations in the last
analysis will always depend on the extent to which
its members support it when the going gets rough.
In my opinion, no amount of words and clever
di lomatic gestures can obscure this fact.
he contribution of the United States in Korea
was of overwhelming importance and reﬂects
great credit on us. In the war in Korea, member
states of the United Nations, other than the United
States, contributed the equivalent of two divisions
which, when compared with the enormous con-
tribution of the United States, does not seem very
much, even though it is far better than nothing and
even though it saved the United States the expense
of putting up two more divisions of our own
which, incidentally, repaid us our assessed con-
tribution to the United Nations many times over.
But there is no doubt in my mind that if United
States oﬂicials at that time had not re uired states
having valuable manpower to reimbirse us in
dollars for the supplies which we provided them,
we might well have had perhaps as much as three
divisions more. But naturally, nations not havi
mechanized equipment, not having shipping, an
not having dollars were unable to undertake to
supply equipment, ship ing, and dollars which
they did not possess. his had the effect of re-
ducing the foreign troop contribution.
In World War II the Congress ri htl pro—
vided that it was advantageous for tie nited
States to rovide Russian and French soldiers,
for examp e, with clothing and equipment for the
very sim le reason that this tended to save the
lives of merican soldiers and to hasten the vic-
tory. It is a mysterious sort of logic which main-
tains that the American man who was ﬁghtin in
Korea was not entitled to as much help as his 0 der
brother was in World War II.
I can assure you that under the policy of this
Administration this situation will not be repeated.
The President’s policy is that, while in principle
each nation involved in a United Nations eﬂort
to repel an aggression should eqﬂp and supply
its own troops to the extent that It is able, the
overriding consideration should be the maximum
contribution of effective manpower. When any
such nation is willing to contribute effective man-
power but not able to provide for logistic support,
the Department of Defense should furnish to such
nation military equipment, supplies, and services,
without requirement of payment to the extent that
the Department of State, in consultation with the
Departments of Treasury and Defense, may deter-
mine such nation cannot reasonabl be expected
to pay. A nation capable of contri uting money
beyond the support of any forces furnished by it
should of course be encouraged also to contribute
toward the logistic support of the forces of other
nations. Except when the manpower furnished
by any such nation is additional to forces already
furnished by it, the contribution should be in
effective milita units as determined by the De-
partment of De ense.
To conclude: The work you are doing here can
be of prime im ortance in helping the American
people to stu these issues intelligently and
soberly. Presi ent Eisenhower has said that this
Government is “committed irrevocably to the su -
port of the United Nations.” In his historic
address last April 16, he pledged that the United
States is ready in the future as it has been in the
past, to help ‘make of the Ilnited Nations an in-
stitution that can effectively guard the peace and
security of all peoples.M \Vith these two state-
ments as our text, the United States can provide
the sort of enlightened leadership which the peo-
ple of the world hopefully seek.
