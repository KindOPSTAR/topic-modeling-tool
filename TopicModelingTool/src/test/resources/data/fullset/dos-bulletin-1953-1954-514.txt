that the Chinese Communist regime became an
aggressor in the latter part of 1950. Its armies
invaded Korea and wa ed war a ainst the United
Nations Command. he contributed lar ely to
the killin , wounding, or osin in action 0 about
500,000 so diers of the United ations Command,
including over 100,000 Americans.
The United Nations General Assembly on
February 1, 1951, voted, 44 to 7, that the Chinese
People’s Republic was guilty of aggression in
Korea. It called u on it to withdr w its forces
from Korea. But they still remain.
It is true that the Chinese Communist Command
concluded a Korean Armistice. But that was not
a Chinese Communist good will offering. It was
something that the United Nations Command won.
The Communists si ed only after desperate and
bloody ﬁnal eﬂ’orts ad failed to break the Allied
line, and only after the United Nations Command
had made it apparent that the conﬂict, if con-
tinued, would bring into jeopardy valuable Com-
munist military and industrial assets in nearby
Manchuria.
The Chinese Communists’ continuing lack of
nuine will for peace is being demonstrated in
ndochina.
As one of the United Nations me rs who must
pass on representation, we must ask ill it serve
the interests of world order to bring into the
United Nations a regime which is a convicted ag-
gressor, which has not purged itself from that
aggression, and which continues to promote the
use of force in violation of the principles of the
United Nations?” I can ﬁnd only the answer
“N oi’J ,.
Free China on Formosa
There is still anoiher aspect of this China mat-
ter. We must not forget that the National Govern-
ment of China continues to function in Formosa
and millions of free Chinese are gathered there
under its jurisdiction. It has the allegiance of
many more. They have been our loyal friends
and allies when, during World W'ar II, we needed
each other.
Should the free nations facilitate and encourage
the bloody liquidation by the Chinese Commu-
nists of these free Chinese on Formosa? To me,
again, the only answer is “No.”
Experlonco Wlth Communist Promlses
Some sa that the United States should recog-
nize the inese Communist regime and welcome
it to the United Nations, in reliance of promises in
relation to Korea and Indochina.
The United States must judge that proposal on
the basis of past experience.
The United States agreed to recognize the Soviet
regime in 1933 relying on its promise, in the so-
called “Litvinov agreement,” to avoid and prevent
political action from Russia against our political
or social order. IVe performed and granted
recognition. But the promises we received were
vain. '
At Yalta, in February 1945, Britain and the
United States ave sanction to the fact of domi-
nant Soviet in uence in Central Europe. They
did so on the basis of a Soviet a ment that the
peoples of liberated Europe wou d have the right
‘to choose the form of overnment under which
they will live,” and that in Poland there would be
“free and unfettered elections as soon as possible.”
But those promises we received were vain.
There was also a Yalta a eement with refer-
ence to the Far East. The nited States a ed
to obtain for the Soviet Union control of ort
Arthur, Dairen, and the Manchurian Railroad.
In exchange, the Soviet Union promised to sup-
port the National Government of China. This
arrangement was consummated at Moscow in
August 1945. Then the Soviet Government ac-
quired from China the Manchurian assets that had
been promised it. In return it gave a 30-year en-
ga ement “to render to China moral support and
ai in military supplies and other material re-
sources, such sugport and aid to be entirely given
to the National overnment as the central govern-
ment of China.”
Having gained what it wanted, the Soviet Gov-
ernment then moved promptly to assist the Chinese
Communist regime in its efforts to overthrow the
National Government. It gave to the Chinese
Communist forces vast stocks of military supplies
and other material resources which it had
Eromised to give entirely to the National
overnment.
In this matter again we gave performance. But
the corresponding Communist promises proved
va n.
ur e rience with Chinese Communist.
promises is imited because we have with them only
one a reement. That is the Korean Armistice.
The nited Nations Command has reported that
the Communists have violated it 40 time». That
only tells part of the story, for the basic violation
is that the Swedish and Swiss members of the
Supervisory Commission are denied an adequate
o portunity to supervise the North and to detect
ommunist violations.
The United States recognizes that few nations
have a record which is not marred by some viola-
tions of agreements. Also, we recognize that
nothing human is immutable. Surely, there is
nothing vindictive or implacable about the Ameri-
can people. Indeed, few people are as ready as
we to forgive and forget. But it would be reckless
for us to ignore the events of recent years which
have ﬁlled our archives with vain promises. We
are not in the market for more.
It is now the policy of the United States not to
exchange United States performance for Com-
munist promises.
