SEVENTY-FIRST REPORT: FOR THE PERIOD
JUNE 1-15, 1953 ‘
U.N. doc. 5/3117
Dated October 20, 1958
[Excerpts]
I herewith submit report number 71 of the United
Nations Command Operations in Korea for the period
1—15 June 1053, inclusive. United Nations Command
communiques numbers 16324646 provide detailed ac-
counts of these operations.
The Armistice Negotiations continued in executive ses-
sion. and the first meeting of the main Delegations was
held on 4 June 1953. No details of the discussions were
made public until 8 June 1953. at which time the Delega-
tions released to the press the “Terms of Reference for the
Neutral Nations Repatriation CommissionM which were
ratiﬁed at 1400 hours on 8 June by the Senior Delegates
of both sides. For the remainder of the period negotia-
tions were continued in plenary sessions and in sub-
delegation and staff oﬂicer meetings; but no details of
the agreement reached at these meetings were released to
the press.
On a somewhat reduced scale during the period. strongly
Communistic prisoners of war in United Nations Command
custody continued their efforts to harass and embarrass
the United Nations Command. Main difﬁculties were
encountered in the KoJe-do complex where on several
occasions prisoners. in deliberate violation of standing
instructions. refused to participate in headcounts, showed
their defiance by shouts and mass chanting, and were
abusive to their guards.
Also. of particular note were many instances of beatings
by fellow prisoners in the pro-Communist camps. These
acts of violence were widespread enough throughout the
various compounds to indicate there is a continuing
struggle by the hard core leaders to maintain rigid control.
Meanwhile. as the negotiations at Panmunjom devel-
oped. those prisoners who have elected not to return to
Communist control showed signs of apprehension as to
their ultimate fate after an armistice. To insure that all
these anti-Communist prisoners could be certain that the
United Nations were adhering firmly to the principle of
no forced repatriation, the normal information program
at each camp emphasized the factual developments Occur-
ring at Panmunjom as they became public. Emphasis
was placed on United Nations Command insistence that,
in any arrangement finally carried out for the disposition
of prisoners of war not directly repatriated, force or
coercion would not be used.
As the world watched closely those developments which
might lead to a full exchange of prisoners of war who
desire repatriation, Communist attempts to capitalize on
the exchange of sick and injured personnel slackened.
Instead of the earlier broadcasts from enemy areas alleg-
ing maltreatment, underfeedlng and poor medical care for
those prisoners returned by the United Nations Command,
reports were received of certain Communist prisoners
who were being treated as defectors. This contradicted
previous Communist claims that all who had been returned
had been greeted as outstanding patriots and Would enjoy
special privileges henceforth.
After agreement was reached on the organization and
functions of a neutral nations repatriation commission
on 8 June, the full text of the terms of reference was
communicated to all prisoners of war held by the United
Nations Command. A summary of the principal points
was also broadcast, both to prisoners and to the Korean
people in general. Leaﬂets and broadcasts described the

salient provisions of the draft armistice agreement, and
emphasized the continued support of the United Nations
for achievement of Korean rehabilitation and uniﬁcation
by peaceful methods.

I herewith submit report number 72 of the United
Nations Command Operations in Korea for the period
10-30 June 1953, inclusive. United Nations Command
communiqués numbers 16-17—1661 provide detailed ac-
counts of these operations.
Armistice negotiations continued in executive session
with staff groups meeting daily to elect necessary changes
in the Draft Armistice Agreement. On 16 June, Liaison
Ofﬁcers of both sides also met for several hours. On 17
June a plenary session, lasting twenty minutes. was con-
ducted, and immediately thereafter staﬂ groups resumed
their daily meetings to continue their work of finalizing
the Draft Armistice Agreement.
During the early morning hours of 18 June 1953, and
without prior warning, a series of prisoner of war
"escapes" were engineered through the Republic of Korea
security guard personnel at anti-Communist prisoner of
war camps on the South Korean mainland, which resulted
in further delays in signing an armistice.' The element
of surprise from the Republic of Korea standpoint was
complete. It is regrettable, however, that this precipitous
action was taken in violation of United Nations Command
authority.
The United Nations Command moved rapidly to re-
trieve the situation in so far as possible. The Commander-
in-Chief, United Nations Command. immediately an-
nounced that this action was purely unilateral on the
part of the Republic of Korea Government and was taken
in spite of previous assurances from President Rhee that
no such action would be taken without prior warning.
Further, United Nations Command troops were desig-
nated to replace Republic of Korea Army troops at the
prisoner of war camps without delay. United Nations
Command patrols were dispatched to recapture as many
prisoners as possible. The latter action could never be
productive in view of the attitude of the South Korean
populace which had been carefully instructed to provide
refuge and assistance to the escaping prisoners.

United Nations Command leaﬂets and radio broadcasts
made factual reports on the continuing discussions and
negotiations with the Republic of Korea, and with the
Communists, to arrange an end to hostilities. Particular
emphasis was also placed on summarizing the monu-
mental efforts which have already been made by the
United Nations Command and other agencies of the United
Nations to give economic assistance to the Korean people
in rebuilding and rehabilitating their nation in the wake
of Communist aggression. The numerous contributions
by various member nations to this diﬂicuit program are
being fully reported to the Korean people.
The United Nations Civil Assistance Command. Korea
(Uscacx) was reorganized and redesignated as the Korea
Civil Assistance Command (Kcac), so as to operate under
the direct supervision of the Commander-in-Chief, United
Nations Command. The chief purpose in creating Kcao
