Orient. I came to J a an eager to learn about her
people and her problems. The friendships ex-
tended to me, the faith placed in our intentions,
the unﬂagging consideration shown by high ofﬁ-
cials in the Japanese Foreign Ofﬁce and throu h-
out the Government is an experience for whic I
shall always be grateful.
At that time Ambassador Iguchi was the Under
Secretar for Forei Affairs.
Now, our Exce ency, as Ambassador to the
United States, it might be suggested that our
positions are rather in reverse. But you are not
a stranger to my country as I was to ours. Am-
bassador Iguchi ﬁrst came to America in 1933,
when he served as consul for 2 years in New York
and then in Chicago for 1 year. After returning
to Japan, Ambassador Iguchi came back to us in
1940 as Consul General in New York and then as
Counselor of Embassy in \Vashington. Thus,
Your Excellency, ou bring to your new responsi-
bilities a knowle go and experience of greatest
value. You also return to America and to a wide
circle of friends who remember you with esteem
and affection. '
Ambassador Iguchi has many other ualities
which endear him to Americans. Among t em, he
is a baseball player—-at least, like many of us these
later years, an armchair one—who owned the
“Tai o \Vhales.” I don’t know how the record of
the hales would compare with the Yankees;
perha s he will feel more at home with the Sena-
tors. ii any case, another hobby of his, golf, will
doubtless protect him from the rigors of Wash-
ington.
Ambassador Iguchi is, furthermore, one of the
postwar leaders of Japan who has contributed
most effectively to Japan’s progress in reestab-
lishing itself within the community of nations.
There is no denying that Japan, its leaders, and
its people still have a long, hard road to travel
before reaching their objectives. Nevertheless,
the strides made since the end of the war support
the conviction that the courage and determination
of the Japanese nation will produce success. At
a time when American responsibilities for occupa-
tion and reconstruction have ceased, Japan and
the United States have entered an era of friendly
and understanding cooperation.
Postwar Treaties Wlth Japan
For example, one of the major steps Japan and
the United States have taken together is the com-
pletion of a Treaty of Friendship, Commerce,
and Navigation, which I signed at Tokyo last
April. This is the ﬁrst commercial treaty entered
into by Japan since the war. Based on a belief
in the mutual beneﬁt of expanded trade, commer-
cial relations between the two countries have been
placed on a basis that grants the businessmen of
our respective countries more freedom of action.
Japan is also a participant in the General Agree-
ment on Tariffs and Trade. Thirty-four contract-
ing parties to GATT and Japan have agreed that
commercial relations between them will be based
on the a reement until Japan becomes a full mem-
ber of ATP, robably by mid-1955.
In early ebruary regularly scheduled com-
mercial ﬂights were started by Japan Air Lines be-
tween Tokyo and San Francisco, a result of the
recent United States-Japanese Civil Air Transport
Agreement. This agreement has been effective
since September 1953.
A 4-year copyright arrangement between the
United States and J a an was established last
November 10 to protect 0th Japanese and Ameri-
can literary, artistic, and musmal works. Both
of our Governments look forward to the day when
a permanent copyri ht agreement can be reached
on a mutually satis actory basis.
A protocol on the exercise of criminal juris-
diction over United States forces in Japan was
negotiated and signed on September 29, 1953,
granting Japan the same rights as are enjoyed by
the N ATO countries. On Fe ruary 12 our Ambas-
sador at Tokyo signed an agreement on behalf of
the United Nations forces stationed in Japan
which accorded them substantially the same treat-
ment as is accorded to United States forces there.
Japan's Bld for U.N. Membership
The United States, as you know, has sponsored
Japan’s bid for United Nations membership, when
we presented a resolution to that effect to the
Security Council in Au ust 1952. The Soviet
Union used the veto to b ock Japan’s admission.“
In December of that year it also opposed a reso-
lution of the General Assembly which registered
the opinion that Japan was a peace-lovin state
within the meaning of the charter and shou] there-
fore be admitted to membershi .
The United States will continue to press for
J a an’s admission to the United Nations. Ambas-
sa or \Varren Austin stated our position in Sep-
tember 1952. He declared:
It is for the Security Council to say whether Japan is
a peaceloving state, able and willing to carry out its
obligations under the charter. In the opinion of my Gov-
ernment, Japan fully possesses all of these qualiﬁcations.
Japan desires to be a part of and play an important role
in the international community. As a state which now
lacks the means of self-defense, she needs collective
security as envisioned by the United Nations Charter.
The United Nations needs this nation of 85,000,000 people.
Japan's membership will strengthen the United Nations
and will assist in achieving the maintenance of inter-
national peace and security.
The United States is proud to recognize Japan's return
to the international community of nations and to put
before the Security Council the draft resolution in support
of Japan’s application for admission to the United
Nations.‘
