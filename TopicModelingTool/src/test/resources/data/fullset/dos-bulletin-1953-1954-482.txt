that contact, too, there are opportunities to clear
up misunderstandin s which, left uncorrected,
at times mean the di erence betwexan a permanent
friend of the United States and a resentful critic.
There is the story of a young Chinese lad who
complained to an American friend that the towns-
people in the little village near his school “stared”
at him. He was very unhap y about it. The
American boy asked him, “Pa ,” he said, “what
would the people do if I visited a little town in
your country where the had never before seen
an American?” The Chinese boy thought it over.
“The children,” he admitted laughing, “would
chase after you yelling ‘Big Nose’.” The hurt
was gone.
The ﬁnancial sup ort given the exchange ro-
grams by rivate in ividuals and groups has een
substantia . For the 1953 program such sup ort
is estimated at $8 million, given through schdlar-
ships and other assistance awarded in conjunc-
tion with Government grants.
An example is the cooperative arran ement de-
veloped for foreign newsmen to enab e them to
get work experience on American news apers.
hese papers pay the ex enses within the nited
States of the newsmen, w 'Ie the Department pro-
vides international transportation. Now in its
second year, this project has brought over 35 for-
eign newsmen to work on American newspapers
in all parts of the United States. Also, over 1,000
local screening committees assist in recommend-
ing qualiﬁed American candidates and some 600
oﬂicials of educational institutions serve as stu-
dent advisers in helping foreign students become
adjusted to American college and campus life.
Many similar services are performed by overseas
groups in cooperation with our missions abroad.
Cooperntlng Agenclee
The Department utilizes a number of public
and private agencies to assist in carrying out the
complex services involved in the program, such
as, for example, scheduling and announcing com-
petitions, processing and recommending candi-
dates, orienting and supervising grantees, and
evaluating program effectiveness. This is in ac-
cordance with section 1003 of the Smith-Mundt
Act, directing the Department to utilize to the
maximum extent practicable the services and fa-
cilities of private agencies.
Altogether, 36 such agencies are currently co-
operating with the Department under contract.
They were selected because of their particular
competence in specialized exchange ﬁelds and in-
clude such agencies as the Institute of Interna-
tional Education, the United States Ofﬁce of
Education, the National Social Welfare Assembly,
the Governmental Affairs Institute, the Confer-
ence Board of Associated Research Councils, and
the American Council on Education.
RECEPTION AND ORIENTATION
Reception Centers
The Department, through its four reception
centers (New York, Miami, New Orleans, San
Francisco? helps to create a favorable ﬁrst impres-
sion of his country. These centers make ar-
rangements for meeting certain visitors at docks
and airports, make arrangements for hotel accom-
modations and onward travel, and set u local con-
tacts which further the purpose of t ieir visits.
Altogether, these centers assisted 5,003 foreign
visitors during this period.
Waehlngton lnternntlonnl Center
The IVashington International Center provided
1,427 leader grantees with a week’s intensive orien-
tation course, including lectures, discussion
groups, tours to points of historic interest, and
visits to Washington homes.‘ These visitors also
included grantees sponsored by the Foreign Oper-
ations Administration and the Department of De-
fense under a cooperative arrangement whereby
the Department and these agencies share the cost
of the center. The success of the program is due
largely to the hospitality and other assistance pro-
vided by over 200 private Washington individuals
and agencies.
Amerlcan Language Center
The language center provided English language
refresher instruction to 137 grantees of the De-
partment, the Foreign Operations Administra-
tion, and the Department of Defense, whose lan-
guage proﬁciencies were inadequate to carry out
their program. In the course of instruction,
usually lasting 2 weeks or more, materials having
to do with American government, social structure,
and culture are used.
Unlverelty Orlenhtlon Centers
Orientation centers were established in 12 col-
leges and universities to provide an introduction
to American life and the American system of
higher education, as well as to give instruction in
the English language to 544 foreign students as a
preparation for their study in the United States.
The Experiment in International Living also ar-
ranged for 116 additional students to live in
American homes for 6 weeks during the summer
months.
