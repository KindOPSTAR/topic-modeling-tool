These goals have a high place in the charter and
were articulated in greater detail in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights. This declaration
is, in the words of President Eisenhower, “ a sig-
niﬁcant beacon in the steady march toward achiev-
ing human rights and fundamental freedoms for
al .”° Since the establishment of these goals,
much time and effort has been expended on the
drafting of covenants on human rights. How-
ever, we now believe that the oals of the charter
are more likely to be advanced! by a human rights
action program which strives to put into practice
the principles of the Universal Declaration. We
have proposed such a program and it will soon
be considered by the Human Rights Commission
now meeting in New York.
Charter Revlew
I have spoken of the creditable record of the
United Nations as an instrument of eaceful
change. It still has untapped potentialities for
the future. It is in this perspective that we must
look at the forthcoming review of the charter.
“'e want to explore, with your help, whether or
not changes can be made in the charter which will
further advance its purposes and principles. At
the same time, the history of the last 8 years dem-
onstrates that many changes can be achieved by
new procedures w ich are already within the
scope of the present charter.
As the preparations for charter review get un-
der way, it is pertinent to take account of the fears
some hold that the Charter Review Conference
may undermine or even destroy the United
Nations.
The process of charter review should not be
feared. As Secretary Dulles recently told the
Senate Subcommittee on Charter Review:7
“The Executive ap roaches this conference with
an awareness of the esirability of erfecting the
Charter, but also with a determination not to lose
the good that is in the search for something better.”
Charter review offers us sin ular opportunities
to build for the future. A so er and thoughtful
reexamination can stimulate us to ﬁnd ways of
doing better those things that need doing. This
afternoon, I have touched u on how the United
Nations has attempted to fu ﬁll the late Senator
Vandenberg’s desire to make the United Nations
an instrument for peaceful change. Perhaps these
reﬂections upon the record of the past 8 ears will
stimulate consideration of the means or better
carrying out the process of future peaceful change,
so essential to this atomic era.
The road ahead is not an easy one. But I think
our consideration of the future of the United Na-

tions can be fruitful if we recall the words of
Secretary Dulles:
“I believe that it lies within our power to ad-
vance the great objective of the United Nations
provided we are atient, resourceful, and resolute,
and inspired by aith that man has the capacity to
overcome evil with good.”
Korean Polltlcal Conference
Press release 103 dated March 2
Following is the text of a letter from Ambassa-
a'or Arthur H. Dean to Secretary Dulles, together
with Acting Secretary Smith’s reply:
Letter from Ambassor Dean
FEBRUARY 26, 1954
MY DEAR MR. SECRETARY! Since the end of July
last I have had the privilege of working with the
President and with you on various matters in re-
lation to the Korean Armistice, have made two
trips to Korea as well as numerous trips to Wash-
ington and spent eight weeks at Panmunjom on
preliminary talks.1
\Vhile in Korea I had many talks with President
Rhee and his cabinet and with General Thimayya
and other members of the NNRC in connection with
effecting the release of nonrepatriated risoners.
Ever since my return from Korea have been
prepared, on a moment’s notice, to return to Pan-
munjom to resume the preliminary talks and con-
sequently have been unable to make any deﬁnitive
professional engagements. As I said to you last
August, when you were kind enough to ask me to
be your Deputy at the forthcoming Political Con-
ference on Korea, then scheduled to start on Octo-
ber 28, 1953, I had committed myself to court en-
gagements which would not permit me to continue
actively on the conference work beyond March, or
at the outside, April 1954. It was then believed
that the Political Conference would be over by this
time.
I shall, of course, be glad to continue to study
various bases for effective and lasting peace in
Asia and to aid the free peoples there to make an
effective ﬁght against Communism and to be avail-
able for consultation from time to time on matters
relating to the forthcoming conference as you and
the Department may wish, but I regret, for the
reasons set forth above, that it will not be ossible
for me to be abroad for several months at t e time
of the Geneva Conference, which will not begin
until the end of April.

tempted negotiatious at Panmunjom, see BULLETIN of Jan.
