A FreshlLookIat the United Natlons
by David McK. Key
Assistant Secretary for United Nations Aﬁcirs‘
In responding to the kind invitation of Dr.
Mayo to address you tonight, I have been given my
ﬁrst opportunity to visit your beautiful and justly
famous state.
I am also taking the opportunity, unknown to
him, to pay tribute on his own home ground to a
man who pla ed a leading part at the last meeting
of the Unite Nations General Assembly in dem-
onstratin that the attem ted defamation of a
nation’s c aracter, no less t an that of an individ-
ual is the concern of every nation and ever in-
dividual; that charges which the facts wil not
substantiate convict the accuser; and that “a de-
cent respect to the opinions of mankind” as stated
in our Declaration of Independence is still a
cardinal principle of our national and interna-
tional conduct. I refer to the valuable services of
Dr. Mayo to his count in assisting the United
States in the United ations to disprove, cate-
gorically and utterl , the Communist charges that
the United States ir Force had employed germ
warfare in the Korean war.’
It was not an easy task which confronted the
United States. So fantastic were the Communist
charges as they appeared in the light of scientiﬁc
fact that the were ridiculous to any rational man.
Yet they had, to be taken seriously because of man-
kind’s unfortunate tendency to believe what he
hears if it is repeated often enough. For over 2
years the Communists had used every technique of
propa anda to spread their vicious untruths
aroun the world. Thus we were confronted with
a mass of false conclusions based on a mass of
fabricated data.
To demolish these charges, Dr. Mayo used the
very weapon against which the Communists have
the least defense, the scientiﬁc method, the method
responsible for the pre-eminence of American

medicine, American technolo , and American in-
dustry. The skill with whic he devastated the
Communist position made an indelible impression
on those who attended that session of the General
Assembly. He ex lained, for instance, how the
Communists, in or er to create evidence to sup ort
their charges, had deliberately perverted to air
ends the techniques used by the Russian biologist
Pavlov in his experiments on dogs and rats, to
produce a “conditioned reﬂex” under which the
risoners would automatically respond in a pre-
determined manner to rehearsed Communist ques-
tions. The Assembly responded by strongl con-
demning these unfounded charges. An , since
the Assembly is, in a sense, a loudspeaker with
many outlets, Dr. Mayo’s words echoed around
the world and the falsity of the Communists’
charges was brought home to people everywhere.
This important e isode of the last General As-
sembly illustrates ow the United Nations as a
world forum can be used to advantage by the
United States and the free world to expose the
vicious propa anda techniques of the Communists.
There are otger examples. Against the strenu-
ous objections of the Soviet bloc, we also brought
into the international s otlight a carefully docu-
mented report prepare b three eminent jurists
from India, Norway, and eru which fully estab-
lished that systems of slave labor are an essential
part of the economy and a means of political coer-
cion in the Soviet Union and its satellites. This
report, coming as it does from objective sources, is
a telling indictment of the police state.
At the same session of the General Assembly our
delegation successfully disproved the false Com-
munist claim that they had abided in Korea by the
Geneva conventions regardin treatment of pris-
oners. We brought the truth about Communist
atrocities in Korea to the attention of the world.
Statements, de ositions, and eye-witness accounts
of returned nited Nations prisoners of war
groved that the Communists had brutally liqui-
ated countless prisoners and had used physmal
and mental torture as a calculated system for ob-
