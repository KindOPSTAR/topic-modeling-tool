mander, Europe. The detailed measures of association
which may be arranged will be determined by joint con-
sultation with SACEUR. [Supreme Allied Commander,
Europe] Such arrangements may include

as may be nominated by the European Defence Com-
munity.

iv. In the early stages of the formation of the European
Army. the British Army will, if desired, assist them in
their planning in the following ways:
(a) by the secondment of ofﬁcers to the Headquarters
of tt'fhe European Army and to its training and logistics
sta s;

Chemical Warfare and administrative training establish-
ments) ;

may be made for the exchange of personnel similar to
those already existing for the exchange of personnel be-
tween the United Klngdom forces and forces of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organisation. Until, however, common
doctrines are developed by the United Kingdom and Euro-
pean Defence Forces, the level and number of such ex-
flhanges will necessarily be limited and on the following

Headquarters of the British Army stationed on the Conti-

will be determined by joint consultation with SACEUB. If
requested by Sacsur, such arrangements may include:
(a) the inclusion of British Army formations within
European Army formations, and vice versa, where military
considerations make this desirable, and logistic considera-
tions make it practicable;
(b) large-scale Joint United Kingdom and European
Defense Community manoeuvres within the North Atlantic
Treaty Organisation. In this case the directing and um-
piring staffs may be integrated temporarily;
(c) the participation of United Kingdom divisions in
training and exercises with the European Army under
the overall command of Sacsua, and vice versa. in simi~
lar conditions, small units of the British Army may take
part in formation training with the European Army and
vice versa.
NAVY
vii. Close association already exists between navies of
the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
and the Royal Navy. and will be extended to the Euro-
pean Defence Community. Assistance during the build-up
period may be of particular value.
viii. The Royal Navy will cooperate in the following
ways :—
(a) by the provision of limited training facilities;
(2)) by the participation of Royal Navy units in training

pean Naval Forces;
