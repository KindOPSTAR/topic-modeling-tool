licized, were some medium bombers. Obviously,
it is wasteful to provide aircraft or any other type
of weapon to a force in the ﬁeld unless there is
some assurance of adequate maintenance. With
this in mind, the French asked for and we in-
creased our military aid group by 200 aircraft
mechanics. These Air Force mechanics will train
French mechanics to replace them and are to be
withdrawn in June.
\Vhere we can help the French and Associated
States with materiel, we will do so. \Ve have un-
derwritten General Navarre’s plan, and believe it
will produce success.
Conference at Caracas
Next month the spotlight of international affairs
focuses on Caracas, where the American States
meet in conference. Here we will sit down with
our neighbors, conscious of a owing atmosphere
of continental solidarity angl- material respect.
Unha pily, one American nation, Guatemala, has
been eeply penetrated with the virus of interna-
tional communism, but this is the source of as
grave concern to every other American State as
it is to us.
In Caracas, the uestions to be discussed are
largely economic. e have by comparison iven
very little direct aid to our Southern neig bors
when one considers their importance to us, but
they are people who want to stand on their own
feet. Most of these nations are moving _very effec-
tively and positively to encourage private investments, to insure them against discrimina-
tory practices, and to protect t em. I be e that
we, on our part, will be able, before the con erence
ends, to give them adequate assurance of support
and of acceptance in principle of the highly im-
portant program worked out by Dr. ilton
Eisenhower and his associates during his recent
trip. I never read a more constructive report,3
and it deserves all possible support. We have no
better nor more loyal allies than our Latin Amer-
ican friends. If we are inclined to get steamed
up about the rise in coffee prices it is worthwhile
remembering that if we grew the. coffee that
Colombia, for example, ex orts to us, it would cost
about $6 per pound. T e producing countries
are just as worried about these prices as we are—
more so, in fact, because coffee is theirmoney crop,
and I believe that the investigation_ now in
rogress will demonstrate that the original pro-
gucers are not the ones that are making the big
proﬁts. _
Now, gentlemen, the one word of adVIce that the
Secretary gave me before I left was a sentence
from George Washington’s copybook. It is “Let
your discourse with men of business be short and
comprehensive.” I don’t answer for the com-
prehensiveness, but I can at least provide good
terminal facilities. Before taking advantage of
them, I want to emphasize the great and immedi-

paved the wa for the latter.
For examp e, the network of American diplo-
matic missions in the Far East can be traced, in
part, to the enterprise of the masters of the t
clippers. They beat their wa ’round the orn
to San Francisco and from t ere set out across
the Paciﬁc, bound for ports of call on the Asiatic
coast. This “China trade” was a progenitor of
our far-ﬂung diplomatic and consular network in
the Orient.
The duties of American diplomatic representa-
tives abroad emphasize the protection and en-
couragement of private American commercial
interests.

The U.S. Foreign Service
Therefore in conclusion, I would like to speak
of the men in our Forei n Service. It seems to
me that it has become ashionable to deprecate
their efforts to advance the welfare and the in-
terests of the people of this country. At times
their abilities have been publicl questioned. In
extreme instances, doubts have n cast on their
loyalty.
Because I am the product of 42 years of a
harsher career service, and because it has been
my privilege to work with our career Forei
SerVice, I wish to testify publicly that it wou d
be difﬁcult to ﬁnd a group equal to them in dedi-
cation to duty, in com etence. and in devotion to
American interests an American ideals.
As supporting evidence, I note from the report
of a recent study mission of t e Senate Comm1ttee
on Foreign Relations:
The people of the United States can be proud of most
of the men and women who represent them abroad. The

have an ability, a know-how. an experience, and an in-
sight into local conditions which our government is espe-
cially fortunate to have at its disposal, and which it could
iii afford to do without.
I believe, from in own observation, that they
have earned the fu 1 support and backing of their
own—the American—pee le. We should 've
this for our own beneﬁt. or, if ever in our is-
tory we needed effective representation abroad,
we need it now. It is the purpose of this admin-
istration, with your help, to give it.
