to conduct a brief ceremony marking the begin-
ning of construction of remedial works in the
Niagara River for the preservation and enhance-
ment of the scenic beauty of the Niagara Falls
and for the purpose of avoiding economic waste by
making possible the use of a larger portion of the
ﬂow of the river for the production of electric
power, without impairment of scenic values.
It is signiﬁcant that in February 1950 the United
States and Canada entered into an a ment em-
bodied in a convention recognizing t eir primary
obligation to preserve and enhance the scenic
beauty of this famous spectacle and, consistent
with that obligation, their common interest in
providing for the most beneﬁcial use of the waters
of the Niagara River. By that agreement they
made the International Joint Commission the
guardian, so to speak, of the interests of the people
in one of their most cherished possessions.
This action was prompted bv deterioration in
the appearance of the falls and by the economic
waste attendant upon the use of only a minor part
of the ﬂow for power purposes. In contrast, it
appears that a sound basis now exists for hoping
and believing that with a proper distribution of
the ﬂow over the crest of the Horseshoe Falls,
with greatly increased ﬂow over the American
Falls, and with the greater part of the Niagara
waters used for power purposes, the falls will be
much more beautiful than they are today, and
moreover, will be more stable and permanent be-
cause recession of the crest will then be at a slower
rate.
The International Joint Commission is officially
concerned here only with perpetuation of the gran-
deur and incomparable beauty of the falls. Other
interests on either side of the boundary are con-
cerned principally with power production, and the
Commission clearly recognizes their right, and the
public interest therein, to make efﬁcient use of all
water available to them under the terms of the
1950 convention. There is no room for a conﬂict
of interests.
Extensive ﬁeld investigations and model experi-
ments necessary to the planning and design of
these important works were carried out for the
Commission by its technical advisers, with the in-
valuable collaboration of the Corps of Engineers,
U.S. Army, and the Hydro-Electric Power Com-
mission of Ontario, which together are now to
construct the works.
These joint endeavors exemplify the friendship,
conﬁdence, and close ties which have existed con-
tinuously between these great countries for nearly
140 years; and the assurance heretofore given by
the two Governments and reiterated today that the
priceless world-famous Falls of Niagara shall be
enhanced in beauty and preserved for posterity,
will, we trust and feel, be received with genuine
satisfaction everywhere.
GEN. A. G. L. McNAUGHTON, CHAIRMAN,
CANADIAN SECTION, INTERNATIONAL
JOINT COMMISSION
\Ve have come here from the Goat Island ﬂank
of the Horseshoe Falls, where we have taken part
in the brief ceremony designed to mark the com-
mencement of the extension of the facilities to view
the falls which are being constructed by the
United States Corps of Army Engineers for the
convenience and pleasure of the very many thous-
ands of people who will come there to see the
famous spectacle at close proximity.
Here, at the head of the rapids downstream
from Grass Island Pool, we are gathered together
for a similar ceremony. We are to witness the
driving of the ﬁrst stake on the base line of the
control structure which will be created by the
engineers and men of the Ontario Hydro-Electric
Power Commission. This structure, with its im-
mense gates, will bring these fast waters under
control and will insure their distribution across
the crest of the falls so that the ﬂow will enhance
their great natural beauty through giving a con-
tinuous curtain of water from shore to shore; and
also by stopping the undue concentration in the
central notch, the progress of the erosion which
is taking place will be halted. And thus assur-
ances will be given for the preservation of the
falls, we have every hope, in perpetuity.
Through the works at Goat Island and by simi-
lar works on the Canadian ﬂank to be built later,
and by the regulating works here, all of which
have been arranged in the most intimate interna-
tional cooperation, not only are we assured that
scenic beauty will be preserved and enhanced but
also we are pleased that the ﬂows not needed for
this primary purpose will be released so that
electrical power in large and useful quantities may
be generated for the service of the people of these
parts both in Canada and in the United States in
equal measure.
Thus after many long years of controversy, the
rival points of view of beauty and of power have
been harmonized, and the dispute between them
ended in full agreement and to the now unques-
tioned and continued advantage of both.
My colleagues in the International Joint Com-
mission, Mr. McWhorter and Mr. Weber of the
United States section and Mr. Spence and Mr.
Dansereau of the Canadian section, join me in
expressing their satisfaction in the memorable
event we witnessed today, and for them and for
myself and for all those who work with us I pledge
the continued trusteeship we are to exercise to the
conservation of this rare and beautiful and treas-
ured phenomenon which is Niagara.
