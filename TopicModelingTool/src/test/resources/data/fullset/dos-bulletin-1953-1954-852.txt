1n and recommending candidates. The Ofﬁce of
Education disseminated information on teacher
exchange opportunities through its contacts with
superintendents of public schools throughout the
country, junior colle es and other teacher train-
ing institutions. It a so utilizes the services of 54
regional teacher interviewing committees as a
part of the screening process. The Conference
card and the American Council on Education
utilize similar grou s in obtaining qualiﬁed
American candidates 1n lecturer, research scholar
and teacher categories. I
Arrangements were made during this period to
simplify the administration of future teacher ex-
change pro ams by transferring to the Oﬁice of
Education t e processin of teacher exchanges for
American schools abroa , formerly performed by
the American Council on Education. This change
consolidates responsibility for the administration
of all teacher exchanges in the Office of Education.
ADMINISTRATION OVERSEAS
United States Educational Foundations and
Commissions abroad, established ursuant to the
Fulbright Act, administer the exc ange program
in each partici atin country in cooperation with
the principal Uhite States Foreign Service ost.
The actiwties of these bi-national on s inc ude
the disbursing of funds available or e ucational
exchanges, disseminating information on oppor-
tunities for study, research or teachin in the
United States, recommending to the card of
Foreign Scholarships foreign nationals and edu-
cational institutions for partici ation in the pro-
gram, arrangin institutiona placement for
American candi ates recommended by the coop-
erating agencies, and providing orientation pro-
grams for American and foreign grantees. The
Foundations and Commissions also submit for re-
view and approval by the Department and the
Board of Foreign Scholarships annual programs
planned to reach exchange 0 jectives within the
needs and opportunities of each country.
Non-United States Government Financial Support
Private and other non-United States govern-
ment groups supported the exchanges carried out
under the Fulbright Act by providing more than
$7,000,000 in assistance during 1953. These groups
included colleges, universities, foundations, hos-
pitals, and private businesses and industries. For
example, the Ford Foundation continued its ﬁnan-
cial support of qualiﬁed lecturers and research
scholars from Near and Far Eastern countries who
lacked necessary dollar resources. Colle es and
universities throughout the country provi ed tui-
tion, maintenance and other scholarship assistance.
Both American and foreign primary and second-
ary school systems provided stipends for American
and foreign teachers under the teacher interchan e
program, and foreign governments provided do -
ar scholarship assistance to foreign travel grant
recipients.
In addition to ﬁnancial aid, both American and
foreign grou s provided a number of important
services, wit out which the program could not
operate effectively. For example, foreign student
advisors helped orient foreign students to Amer-
ican college and community life, and provided
hospitality and other services. Representatives of
American businesses served without com ensation
as members of United States Educationa Founda-
tions and Commissions helping to supervise and
administer the program in participating countries.
Alumni associations overseas, foreign universities,
bi-national foundations and others assisted in the
screening and recommendin of foreign candi-
dates, and provided hospita ity and orientation
for American grantees newly arrived in their
countries.
Not to be overlooked are the many private indi-
viduals, civic and other community groups in the
United States who offer program and hospitality
services to foreign grantees—an important factor
in the grantee’s experience of American life. It
is estimated that over 10,000 private American
citizens assisted the program in these and other
ways during 1953.
Special “State Committees”, appointed by the
Governors of each State and Territory, continued
to recommend panels of candidates for State
Scholarships, under a plan whereby two student
scholarships are reserved for legal residents of
each State and Territory.
