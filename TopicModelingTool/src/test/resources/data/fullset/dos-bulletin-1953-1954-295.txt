a responsibility for remakin the Europe which
Hitler so largely destroy , the liberation of
Austria from the bonda of occupation still
stands after 9 years at e head of the list of
actions we should take.
We should also respond quickly because only
in that way can we eradicate the sorry record of
past negotiations on the Austrian State Treaty.
I have no wish at this time to enumerate the
long and shabby story of delay, disillusion, and
lack of candor which has this far characterized
the Soviet negotiations on Austria.
This time there should be a clear-cut end to
all of that. Can we sit here as the Foreign Min-
isters of our four countries solemnly and seriously
addressin ourselves to agenda item No. 3 and
dare admit that the 374 previous discussions on
this one item over a 7-year eriod have not ex-
plored every conceivable 1100 and cranny of the
Austrian State Treaty?
Austrian Record of Achievement
We should also respond quickly in recognition
of the extraordinary performance of the Austrians
themselves. Compare the Austria of today with
the Austria that met our eyes in the spring of 1945.
At that time a provisional government strug-
gllled in the ruins left by Hitler. The economy—
era was no economy. '
Today the Austrian (people pursue their daily
lives peacefully and in ustriously under the pro-
tection of their democratic constitution.
Few governments in the world today can pre-
sent a record of real achievement com arable to
that of the Austrian Government instal ed in 1945
after free elections and twice freely reelected
since then. This Austrian Government has
brought the Austrian economy to a state of pro-
ductivity and stability which it has not enjoyed
for decades, despite the s phoning off, for the
beneﬁt of Soviet Russia, 027 the roducts of East
Austria. To be sure foreign aidp has helped, and
I am proud that much of it has been contributed
by the United States, but foreign aid without na-
tional will could not have produced the Austria
of today.
It can trul be said that the harmony of Aus-
tria’s interna and external relations, created in
9 years out of the ruins of aggression, is a model
of what can be done when there is a will to do it.
And yet despite this abundantly apparent dem-
onstration 0 political maturity, democratic in-
stitutions, social peace, and economic well-being,
the Austrian people remain under the burden of
occupation and exploitation. Some 60,000 for-
eign troops, over % of them under Soviet com-
mand, garrison Austria. That is practically one
soldier for every 100 inhabitants.
We should also respond quickly because of the
shameful economic burden which has been im-
posed upon Austria durin the past 5 years by
the delay on the treaty. Since 1949 the Soviet
Union has extracted from so-called “German
assets” in its zone of Austria at least 200 million
dollars in net proﬁts. This is a sum larger than
the lump-sum indemnity which in 1949 was set
by the Soviet Union as the rice for the return
to Austria of only some of t ese assets. This is
reason enough for actin on the Austrian For-
eign Minister’s request or alleviation of article
35.
Auetrle Not An Enemy Country
Austria was not an aggressor—Austria is not
a defeated enemy. Austria was a victim of ag-
gi-ession. Austria is, b our own statement in the
oscow declaration 0 November 1, 1943, a lib-
erated and not an enemy countr . As Dr. Figl
has said, it is ironical that we ave long since
concluded treaties with all but one of the Euro-
pean nations which were our enemies.
In a roclamation to the citizens of Vienna
in March) 1945 the late Marshal Tolbukhin, com-
manding the Russian forces in Austria, said “The
Red Army has set foot on the soil of Austria not
to conquer Austrian territory. Its aim is exclu-
sively the defeat of the enemy German-Fascist
troops, and the liberation of Austria. The Red
Army backs the Moscow declaration of the allied
powers on the independence of Austria.”
To fulﬁll the pledge of the Moscow declaration,
so eloquently underscored by Marshal Tolbukhin
and reinforced by innumerable statements, dec-
larations, and resolutions since then, requires
pathetically little. That was also true in 1949.
All that lies between the Austria of today and
the Austria we promised in 1943 is a reement on
ﬁve articles, actually only parts of ﬁve articles,
of the present draft treaty, and consideration of
article 35 in the light of the Austrian Foreign
Minister’s statement today.
The American delegation supports Mr. Eden’s
pro osal listing the few points which need to be
sett ed in order to reach the goal of an Austrian
state treat . After 374 discussions and 10 years
of unﬁlledy pledges, I believe my colleagues will
agree with me that these and only these steps need
to be taken, no other issues are relevant to our task.
Last April President Eisenhower spoke to the
world on the subject of world tensions. At that
time he called for deeds, not words, to prove the
will to peace, and, in fact, he cited the Austrian
State Treaty as just such a deed—a deed requiring
only the sim 1e will to do it. That deed will shine
in a world w ich has become darkened by fear and
disillusionment. If the Soviet Union will join us
in doing this deed, the whole world will rejoice in
the demonstration that our four nations can indeed
cooperate to serve the cause of peace and justice.
Out of that beginning, greater things could come.
