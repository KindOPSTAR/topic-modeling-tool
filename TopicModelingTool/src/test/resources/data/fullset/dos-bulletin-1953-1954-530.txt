pean nations to seek unity of pu ose and action
among themselves. American p0 icies in Europe
since the end of World War II have been lar ely
built around these three ob'ectives. In t eir
broad outlines, the objectives ave been consist-
ently supported by both major political parties
in this country.
ICONOMIC RECOVERY
First priority was given to European economic
recovery. This priority was compelled by the
existing circumstances. There was room for doubt
as to whether the Soviet Union was willing to
launch a full-scale military attack against Europe,
but there was no doubt whatever that a continued
deterioration of the European economy would ro-
duce a political and social chaos from w ich
communism would almost certainly emerge tri-
umphant. Moreover, it was unrealistic to at-
tem t a signiﬁcant defense effort in Europe until
the uropeans had attained a suﬂicient degree of
economic recovery to support such a defense effort.
The keystone of our efforts to promote Euro-
pean economic recovery was, of course, the Mar-
shall plan, developed in 1947 and launched in 1948.
Under this program, we provided more than $12
billion of American money to bolster the Euro-
pean economy. I will not attempt to describe
this program in detail, except to point out that
it was a joint enter rise in which a major effort
was required of the uropean governments them-
selves. Our assistance was matched by strenuous
self-help measures, without which the substantial
results ﬁnally achieved would have been impossi-
ble. One of the important byproducts of the pro-
gram was the formation of the Organization for
European Economic Cooperation, through which
18 European nations worked together to increase
production, reduce trade barriers, and facilitate
the ﬂow of goods throughout free Europe. This
was the ﬁrst big step toward integration in Europe.
1'"! NATO DEFENSE SYSTEM
The development of an adequate defense pos-
ture in free Euro e has also been a joint enterprise,
centering aroun the North Atlantic Treaty Or-
anization. Actually, negotiations toward a col-
ective defense system ﬁrst be an in 1947 among
the United Kingdom, France, cl ium, the Neth-
erlands, and Luxembourg and cu minated in the
Brussels Pact, which created an organization
known as the Western Union. However, it was
evident that no eﬁective defense s stem could be
built without U.S. membership an participation,
so further negotiations were undertaken in 1948
among the Brussels treaty powers and other At-
lantic nations. As a result, the North Atlantic
Treaty, embracing the United States, Canada, Ice-
land, the United Kingdom, and eight nations of
continental Europe was signed in April 1949.
Greece and Turkey also entered NATO in 1952, mak-
in a total of 14 members.
ithout attempting a detailed description of
the provisions of the treaty or the operations un-
dertaken thereunder, I would like to point out one
of its most unusual features. It is more than a
promissory note; it is a working contract. In
addition to the customary mutual pledges by the
member nations to assist one another in event of
attack, it provides for active peacetime coopera-
tion by the member nations to develop the means
for resisting attack. Throu h the North Atlantic
Treat Organization, there ore, the NATO coun-
tries ave undertaken an unprecedented common
defense program. This program has included the
development of joint strategic plans, integrated
international command arrangements, the build-
in of common air bases and port facilities, joint
m1 itary maneuvers and exercises, coordinated
military production plans, etc. It has also in-
volved the grant of a lar e volume of military
equipment from the Unite States to the military
forces of allied countries.
“I'll! POLITICAL FRONT
In the ﬁeld of political activity, the initiative
has remained primarily with the Europeans.
They have had the job of reestablishing and re-
or anizing governments, developing constitutional
re orm, an taking measures against subversive
elements. They have also undertaken to establish
institutions for cooperation amon the European
nations in economic, political, an military mat-
ters. The United States Government has assisted
this process b helping to create the most favorable
economic an psychological environment for the
strengthening of free institutions. The work of
our occupation authorities in Germany and
Austria has contributed greatly to the growth of
democratic societies in those countries. \Ve have
constantly urged European governments to move
more rapidly and more completely toward unity
and have adopted numerous measures to facilitate
this movement. Finally, through our overseas in-
formation program we have tried to promote un-
derstanding of the erils of communism and of
the aims and princip es of the free world, thereby
Eroviding direct assistance to the efforts of the
uropean overnments to counteract the constant
streams o Communist propaganda with which
they are confronted.
Some Major Accomplishments
I have been compelled, for reasons of time, to
present these sweepin policies and rograms in
the barest outline. I-Iowever, I thin it will be
useful to recite some of the major accomplishments
of these policies and programs to date:
First, there has been a very substantial improve-
ment in Europe’s overall economic position. By
1950, when principal emphasis shifted from eco-
