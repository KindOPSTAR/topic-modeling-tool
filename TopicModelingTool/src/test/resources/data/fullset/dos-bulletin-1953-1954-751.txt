Equally basic is our disposition to be friends
with the Ipeo le of the Arab world. Our attitude
toward 1: e tate of Israel may be distasteful to
them and, in many res ects their point of view
is at least understandab e. Eat just as important,
just as real, just as positive, is our attitude toward
the Arab peoples—and it is an attitude of sincere
friendship, enuine interest in their growth, and
wholehearte willin ess to help them achieve
their noblest nationafiispirations.
Second, I believe it is important to understand
the considerations underlyin this American pol-
icy of friendship for both si es. I think they are
compounded of self-interest and our own growing
sense of responsibility for free world leadership.
Dangers In Arab-Israel Tenslons
The danger to world peace in the Middle East is
clear to us all. The unrelentin antagonism be-
tween the Arab States and Israe is an invitation
to mischiefmakers in the Kremlin. No one can
say how swiftly or in what direction the ﬂame of
open war between Arab and Jew mi ht s read.
But no one can doubt that the strategists 0 com-
munism would be quick to fan the ﬂame. Chaos
is their ally.
But open war between the nations of the Near
East is not the only dan er. The more subtle, if
not aver, peril lies in t e retrogressive effect of
Ara Israel tensions. Throughout the region, as
in many other areas of the world, there is a new,
insistent demand for pro ess, evident in mass
unrest and political instabi ities. This unrest has
its origins more in social and economic than in
political problems.
Much of American foreign economic policy to-
day is premised on the assumption that healthy
social progress is the most cﬁ'ective antidote to the
Communist virus, which in common with its bac-
teriological cousins, strikes hardest at rundown,
poorly nourished systems. For this reason, we
have undertaken a global effort to hel less ad-
vanced peoples help themselves towar a better
and more rewarding life. But in the Middle East,
the continuing tensron between Israel and her Arab
neighbors is a massive barrier to economic develop-
ment and the kind of pro ess we believe the peo-
ple of the region must an can achieve.
To cite just one example, the countries of the
Middle East—and I include them all—need capi-
tal. Most of all, they need private investment
capital, with its attendant technical know-how
and skilled management, to develop natural re-
sources and start a cycle of industrial activity.
As Chairman of the International Development
Advisory Board for almost 3 years, I have had
occasion to look into the investment potentials
of the Middle East. Considerable as I believe
them to be, it is abundantly clear that private in-
vestors in this or any other country are not going
to put money into a region that might be plunged
into war at any time.
Until there is rapprochement between the na-
tions of the re ion, social progress is going to be
slow. Until ere is progress, mass discontent
will not abate but well. While the discontent
persists, the ground remains fertile for the seeds
of communism. They are being sown there now.
American interest in the region stems also, of
course, from strata ‘c considerations having to do
with both geograp y and resources. Many times
through the course of history, this ancient land
linkin Asia with Europe and North Africa has
serv as a bridge for conquerors from both East
and West. It is the Eastern land ap roach to the
Suez Canal. Over it lies the route 0 major inter-
national airlines. Beneath the sand of its desert
wastes lies an immense pool of oil important to
the Western World and potentially useful to
Russia and her Eastern European satellites.
When the development of atomic energy for
military and economic application will affect these
strategic considerations, I certainly do not know.
It is conceivable that the adaptation of atomic
energy to industrial pur oses may diminish some-
what the industrial an military importance of
oil in the foreseeable future. But for the pres-
ent, we ma only assume that the Near East re-
mains, in a l respects, a crucial area.
It 1s against this background of American
Middle Eastern policy that the ob'ectives of the
mission given me by the Presi ent must be
wei hed.
T e President asked me, as his Ambassador, to
open discussions with four countries-—Syria,
Lebanon, Jordan, and Israel—about the possi-
bility of developin the physical and economic
resources of the ordan River Valley for the
beneﬁt of man.
Importance ot the Jordan River
Now the Jordan is not much of a river, as we
in America think of rivers. About 200 miles long,
it rises in the mountains of the Lebanon, drops
swiftly into Lake Tiberias, and then ﬂows through
a sub-sea-level valley to the salt Dead Sea. But
in the arid Middle East, water is life. If the
Jordan is small by our standards of comparison,
its waters are as precious as petroleum—far more
recious than we, sittin here tonight “high above
ayuga’s waters,” are ikely to ap rcciate. And
if the river has rolled through t e centuries a
wasted stream, modern science can now make it
a rich potential source of fertility and power in
a valley that sorely needs both.
But the Jordan—and herein lies the difﬁculty—
is an international stream. Four states—Israel,
Lebanon, Jordan, and Syria—have some claim
to its waters. In the context of the Arab-Israel
dispute, the river thus becomes a source of con-
