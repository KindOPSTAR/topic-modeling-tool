says Israel has and must in the future depend
primarily u on its army and its own people. In
the crucial ays of 1948, he points out, the United
Nations was unable to prevent six Arab armies
from invading Israel—and that Israel’s arms,
courage, and resourcefulness alone turned back
the invaders. At the moment, he sees Israel’s
frontiers sub'ected to increasing ressures which
the United ations and the wor d powers have
proved impotent to stop.
This, then, is David’s case. He has re atedly
urged the Arab States to sit down with srael at
a conference table to conclude peace on the above
basis. The Arabs have persistently refused. They
take an almost diametrically opposed stand on
the same issues.
TIIIAIAIOMI
The Arab case must be considered in the con-
text of the present emotional ferment in the Arab
world. Ahmed, the Arab, regards the creation
of Israel as another example of imperialist ex-
ploitation. Thus, his reaction against Israel dove-
tails with the growing nationalism of his people
and feeds their resentment and distrust of the
West. Ahmed’s instinctive reaction to the alien
element of Israel is to build up a wall against it,
to isolate it, and eventuall to absorb or over-
whelm it. Unaffected by the value we place on
time, Ahmed is content to wait, conﬁdent that
Israel will eventually meet the fate which befell
the Crusades.
Ahmed concentrates his bitterness on political
Zionism which he regards as ruthless, materialis-
tic, and exemplifying those traits of Western cul-
ture most antipathetical to him. He declares that
Moslems, Christians, and Jews lived in harmony
until this political factor was injected by the Bal-
four Declaration of 1917. Ahmed fears that fur-
ther immigration of Jewish people to Israel will
inevitabl result in territorial expansion by Israel,
and his ears are based on statements by Zionist
leaders who look to further immi ation.
To Ahmed the creation of Israe may not be jus-
tiﬁed on any ethical or legal grounds. For many
centuries the land belonged to his eople. A tiny
Jewish minority was well treated). Ahmed sees
no ethnic basis for the claim that the Jews now
returning are descendants of the original inhabi-
tants. He points out that the United Nations
was not granted b the Charter the authorit to
deprive a people 0 self-government or drive t em
from their lands.
Ahmed feels that, if Israel bases her claim to
statehood on the 1947 U.N. resolution, she must at
least recognize the boundaries recommended by
the United Nations. Israel cannot in his e es have
it both ways. He demands that the Security
Council should now force Israel to relinquish her
gains won by the force of arms.
The Arab refu ees are seen b him as the end-
product of Israei terrorism, iven from their
homes by cold-blooded massacres, such as that at
Deir Yassin, where over 200 people died at the
hands of the Irgun. He sees no conceivable justi-
ﬁcation for preventing refugees who wish to do so
from returning to their homes as called for by
the United Nations on successive occasions. In
any event, he says the vast sums owed by Israel
to the refugees for conﬁscated property should be
paid promptly.
Accordingly, Ahmed does not wish his nation
to coo erate with Israel in any matter and he
would ike to see third parties prevented from d0-
ing so. Whether this policy may also hurt him is
a secondary consideration. The economic bo -
cott maintained reﬂects this view oint. e
maintains that Israel would quickly co lapse were
it not for United States public and private aid.
Since the United States sustains Israel, he feels
it must assume responsibility for Israel’s actions.
Ahmed believes the city of Jerusalem should
be internationalized in accordance with the resolu-
tions of the United Nations. The fact that Israel
has transferred her capital to Jerusalem only in-
dicates to him disres ect for the United Nations
and the intent to seize additional territory, for
no nation would locate without a purpose its
capital in such an ex osed position.
Although Israel ta ks of eace, he sees it as bent
on] on aggression. Proo in his e es is such acts
as 6ib a and the recent attack on ahhalin, both,
he fee s, deliberately planned by the Israel Gov-
ernment. If Israel wants peace, he believes she
must demonstrate this by actions and win the
confidence of her nei hbors. As a ﬁrst step, he
says, Israel must abi e by the resolutions of the
United Nations, particularly with respect to
boundaries and the repatriation of refu ees. On
this basis, he says the Arab States wou d be pre-
pared to discuss a settlement.
These are the cases. And as I s ak here to-
night the bitterness between Davi and Ahmed
and their people and the dangers seem, in s ite of
all efforts, to increase rather than diminis .
One wonders often in a position such as mine
if he may not be struggling in a situation so set
by the strands of the past that the history of what
will happen, in s ite of all of one’s elforts, may
have been alrea y written—and thousands of
years ago. Yet even if this be true we must to the
limits of our knowledge and capability do that
which seems best for the interests of the area
itself and our own country.
Spcclal Interests vs. Interests of Majority
When I talk about the interests of our country,
I mean our country as a whole. It is only natural
in a situation such as this that there would be
special groups who feel strongly and attempt in
all sincerity to exert the greatest possible inﬂu-
ence on the policy of your Government. We must
weigh these special interests carefully, but we
