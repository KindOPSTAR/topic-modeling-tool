suggested by the Attorney General at the Judicial
Conference in September of 1952. This provides
for study of this roblem by two groups. One, a
small Presidentia commission consisting of re re-
sentatives of the Department of State, the e-
partment of Justice, and of the judicial branch
of the Government. The other, a larger advisory
committee composed of law rofessors and prac-
ticing lawyers. It is hoped t at these groups can
soon be established and bring early progress in
this ﬁeld.

NATO STATUS OF FDIC” AGREEMENT
During the last year, one question of inter-
national law that has long been debated has been
brought nearer to deﬁnitive solution by the rati-
ﬁcation of the Status of Forces Agreement be-
tween the 14 nations making 11 the North At-
lantic Treaty Organization. T is treaty deter-
mined the status of foreign military forces in
friendly territory in time of peace, as among the
14 Atlantic treaty members.
The Status of Forces Agreement, which was
concluded in June 1951 between all of the 14 North
Atlantic Treaty powers, derives its name and its
reason for being from the fact that underlying
the basic North Atlantic Treaty is the intention of
stationing troo s of one contracting sovereign in
the territory 0 another and the free movement of
such troo s between and through the territories
of others in peacetime.
The presence of foreign troops in a country is
no novelty in wartime. But this is the ﬁrst time
that in peacetime foreign troops have been sta-
tioned for long periods in other sovereign coun-
tries. The presence of these forces, With their
equipment, created many problems, which had to
be regularized for the sake of orderly administra-
tion and effective functioning. As a result, the
Status of Forces A eement was negotiated at the
instance of the military authorities.
_ The Status of Forces Agreement is reciprocal
in its operation; that is, the rights which one na-
tion secures for its troops abroad, it must give
to foreign troops on its own soil. The rights
United States troops are iven by France in
France, must be given by 5m United States to
French troops in t e United States. Only on this
basis could the treaty be negotiated, for no sover-
eign nation was willing to give rights to a foreign
nation that that nation was not willing to give
in return.
One of the articles of the agreement covered the
question of criminal 'urisdiction over the troops
of one NA'no power w en present in the territory
of another. In substance, it provided that, when
a soldier committed a crime in the performance of
duty, he was triable by the courts-martial of his
own countr , but that for any crimes he might
commit off uty he was triable in the courts of the
country where he was stationed.
This provision was challenged as being a sur-
render to foreign countries of this country’s ex-
clusive right to try its troops by its own courts-
martial, even thou h the crime was committed in
a foreign state y our troops located there.
Speeches and articles charged that the United
States had delivered its GI’s into the jurisdiction
of foreign courts contrary to a claimed principle
of international law, to the effect that foreign
troops in a country with the consent of its sover-
eign were completely immune from the criminal
jurisdiction of its courts.
This important question of international law
was raised when our Senate was considering the
treaty. It resulted in a. thorou h exploration of
the question and an opinion by t e Attorne Gen-
eral conﬁrming the view of the Secretary 0 State
that there was no such rinciple of international
law. He held that foreign troops were subject to
the criminal jurisdiction of the sovereign where
the crime was committed, in the absence of an
agreement by that sovereign relinquishing such
jurisdiction.
Such a principle of immunity as was claimed to
exist, if it is to be defended at all, must obviously
be shown to be a recognized exception to the gen-
eral rinciple that the territorial sovereign has
juri iction over all persons within its territories.
Everyone knows that some exceptions do exist-—
the immunity of ambassadors is a well-known one,
as is the immunity of foreign vessels of war. Each
such exception, however, stands or falls by the test
of whether it is recognized and practiced by the
community of nations. Exhaustive examination
of authorities and precedents from many countries
of the world failed to reveal even one instance
where any court had decided in favor of the exist-
ence, as a matter of international law, of such an
immunit for members of foreign forces.
N evert eless, this supposed immunity has had a
long and vigorous life among the older textwriters,
and one wonders how this could be, in the absence
of precedent. One reason, I suppose, is the tend-
ency of writers in the international law ﬁeld to
give much weight to the views of earlier scholars,
even in the presence of the contrary practices of
nations. However, the persistence of this unsup-
ported doctrine is a tribute to the great inﬂuence
of our Chief Justice Marshall.
In the case of The Schooner Ewchwnge (7 Cranch
116 (1812) ) , he decided that foreign vessels of war
were not subject to the in rem jurisdiction of
American admiralty courts. To reach this re-
sult he reasoned that while the jurisdiction of the
territorial sovereign was “necessarily exclusive
and absolute,” there were certain exceptions to
this rule based on the consent, express or implied,
