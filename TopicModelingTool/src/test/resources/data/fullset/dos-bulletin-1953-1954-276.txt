Brotherhood In the World of Today
by Deputy Under Secretary Murphy‘
Nobod , I am sure, could receive without emo-
tion the ionor conferred upon me this evening by
the National Conference of Christians and Jews.
However little I may merit this distinction, I am
ltiegeply grateful to your President and the mem-

Through the years since the founding of the
Conference in 1928, there has been constant re-
minder of the good works of your members and
friends in the promotion of higher standards in
our social order. Perhaps in no period of world
history has there been greater need for men and
women of your stamp to do battle with the forces
of prejudice and discrimination in the wilderness
of totalitarianism. Your on has been a haven
of refuge and an inspiration or the weary and
oppressed.
Naturally, as a worker in the ﬁeld of foreign
affairs, my interest was attracted by the founding
in Europe of World Brotherhood in 1950. I can
testify to its effectiveness in the promotion of your
high ideals.
In my case, my appreciation is no less dee
because I know that, in naming me for this awar ,
you were thinking not of me as a person but
rather as a representative of the men and women
in our American F orei Service, who in their
wa are working to builﬁna world of brotherhood.
would like your mission to acce t this
award in their name. Ll); long years in the ervice
give me the ri ht, I think, to act for them and
to s k for t iem whenever opportunity offers.
T ou bout my career I have had many con-
tacts wit American groups, business peo le, ro-
fessionals, those of the armed services. ow ere
have I seen greater dedication to duty and the best
interests of our country and the American people
than in the United States Forei Service.
These people, let me add, nee your conﬁdence.
They need the encouragement of knowing the
American people, their people, are back of them.

Christians and Jews at New York. N. Y., on Feb. 4 (press

the Brotherhood Award to Mr. Murphy by the Conference.
They need, as do we all, an occasional word of
ap reciation.
t me assure you that your country’s repre-
sentatives abroad today yield to none in compe-
tence and in loyalty to American ideals. By en-
couraging them, ou makea ractical contribution

The foreign policy of the United States is de-
cided in Washington. The duty of applying that
polic to local situations abroad devolves upon
the oreign Service. It is a tremendous respon-
sibility at any time, but especially so today.
Recent years have witnessed important develop-
ments in the osition of the Lnited States in
world affairs. oday our country is the acknowl-
edged leader of the free world with all the respon-
sibilities such a role implies.
The objectives of our policies foreign and do-
mestic, remain constant—the welfare and securit
of the people of the United States. But more an
more, over the years, we have found our welfare
and security related to factors outside our own
borders. Necessity has broadened our interests as
well as our ﬁeld of activity.
I think it was Voltaire who once said that, as
disconcerting as it might be on occasion, the
brotherhood of man was an inescapable fact. The
brotherhood of man has ceased to be regarded
merely as an ideal. Toda it is accepted by sensi-
ble men as an inescapab e realit . The foreign

Adjustment of Foreign Policy

United States is no exception. Policies. and the
programs designed to put them into effect, must
be adjusted from time to time to meet new situa-
tions. Such a reexamination of the policies of the
