International Copyrlght Protection
Statement by Thorsten V. Kalijarvi
Acting Assistant Secretary for Economic Aﬂairs ‘
I am appearing in support of the identical bills
H. R. 6616 and H. R. 6670. This proposed meas-
ure to amend the Copyright Act was forwarded to
the Congress last summer by the Secretar of
State as implementing legislation for the Univer-
sal Copyright Convention, which is now before
the Senate for its advice and consent to ratiﬁcation.
A companion Senate bill, S. 2559, identical with
those before you, is before the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
Background
I should like ﬁrst to comment on our present
outgrown and inadequate arrangements for inter-
national co yright protection. I shall then sum-
marize the lieneﬁts to be derived from the Univer-
sal Copyright Convention, which, I am gratiﬁed
to sa , has elicited enthusiastic support through-
out t e United States from all those interested in
co yright protection abroad.
uring the past 75 years there has been a vir-
tually complete transformation in the osition
occupied by the United States in the literary,
scientiﬁc, and creative ﬁelds. From a pioneer
nation importing far more than it exported in the
way of books, music, and other copyrightable ma-
terials, we have grown to a position of prestige and
leadership in this im ortant cultural ﬁeld. Amer-
ican novels and tec nical books are in constant
demand throughout the world, and our music and
movies are enjoyed everywhere.
This rapid growth in American literary, musi-
cal, and artistic creation and its international
recognition has sharply accentuated the need for
improved copyright protection abroad for Amer-
ican works. It is apparent, however, that the
legiil bases on which such protection can be estab-
lis ed are not adequately su plied by our present
framework of internationa arran ements. The
Department believes that these needs can be fully

tives (press release 182).
met by adherence to the Universal Co yright Con-
vention. It is for this reason that the Secretary
of State and the President have urged its ratiﬁca-
tion.
Our present system of international cop right
rotection stems from legislation adopted 8 ortly
efore 1900. Before that time, we had no inter-
national arrangements for this purpose. Our
aramount need had been to obtain free access to
oreign works. Protection of American works
abroad was sketchy and iracy of foreign works
here was rampant. This egislation permitted the
United States to begin the establishment of a series
of bilateral arrangements. This scheme of bi-
laterals, as modiﬁed through the years, represents
the principal foundation for our international
copyright relations. Reduced to its simplest
terms, our present law provides that the United
States will extend copyright protection to the na-
tionals of a foreign state when such state ants
to United States citizens copyright protect1on on
substantially the same basis as to its own citizens.
The law requires that in each case the President de-
termine by means of a roclamation that the nec-
essary reci rocal conditions exist. To form a
basis for t e issuance of the proclamation, the
State Department usually negotiates an exchan
of diplomatic notes to obtain the assurances of ti:
foreign state that it is anting “national treat-
ment ’ to citizens of the nited States.
This bilateral system is not only complicated and
cumbersome but offers inadequate foreign protec-
tion to our nationals. Each arrangement requires
separate time-consuming negotiations. In addi-
tion, whenever the law in the foreign country is
changed, the arrangement must be reviewed and
new negotiations as well as the issuance of a new
proclamation may become necessary. The pro-
tection which it would provide our citizens, if they
had to rely solely upon it, would be ineﬂ'ective and
costly. In order for an American national to ob-
tain protection abroad under this system, he would
have to know and comply with a large number of
technical requirements in the different countries in
