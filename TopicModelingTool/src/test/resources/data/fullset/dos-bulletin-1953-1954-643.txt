In spite of the dark clouds which remain so
ominously on the world horizon, I do not falter
in my conviction that the world is moving toward
greater security throu h collective effort and ever-
extending respect for t 1e essential dignity of man.
I am, however, aware, as I know each one of you
is aware, that hemisphere solidarity is one of the
surest barriers to revent the aggressors’ encroach-
ments on human reedom.
Moves by Enemies of Freedom
While the Americas stand staunch in their int/er-
dependence, the hordes of hatred and violence will
be deterred, and overcome. But let us not forget
that eternal vigilance is still the price of liberty.
Precisely because our mutual strength is great, our
solidarity powerful, we are severally and collec-
tively undergoing the test of our strength. Where
would the enemies of freedom ﬁnd greater advan-
tage in striking—continually, secretly and with
venom—than against the house of freedom? We
know that by inﬁltration, by overt and covert
propaganda, by attempts to sow dissension and
distrust, forces from outside the hemisphere are
continually making it necessary for the American
Republics to afﬁrm their interdependence and their
conﬁdence one in another. It is for this reason
that I am so thoroughly convinced of the impor-
tance of the foreign policy declaration made at
Caracas against the efforts of the international
Communist movement to dominate or control the
political institutions of an American State—
against its intervention in our internal affairs.
It may be that it is too early to try to assess in
realistic terms all of the accomplishments of the
Tenth Inter-American Conference. So far as this
Council is concerned, however, it is quite clear that
the Conference has given it an emphatic vote of
conﬁdence. It has fully recognized the important
work which the Council can carry out through care-
ful and detailed consideration of problems of
major importance, especially in the preparation of
treaties and other instruments in the form in which
they can be resented to the governments for ﬁnal
approval. Resolution 46 of the Final Act of the
Conference entrusts to the Council certain types
of activity which, if this resolution is adequately
implemented, will afford the Council an opportu-
nity to exercise that influence upon the functioning
of the Gas which the representatives of our Gov-
ernments gathered here should at all times be in a
position to exercise.
Furthermore, several resolutions assign to the
Council speciﬁc work in the preparation of drafts
or revisions of such instruments as the Protocol on
Duties and Rights of States in the Event of Civil
Strife, and the Statutes of the Inter-American
Peace Committee. To the Council has also been
assigned the solution of problems related to the
need for revision of the Pact of Bogota and to a
possible statute of an Inter-American Court of
Justice. In its normal executive functions, of
course, the Council must also review and establish
riorities, within the resources which are or may
become available, for the carrying out b the Pan
American Union and other organs of t e OAS of
the numerous projects or programs which were
held to be suitable or desirable in one or another
of the resolutions approved at the Conference.
In the economic ﬁeld, the work of the IA—ECOSOC
in reparation for the important meeting in Rio
de aneiro is perhass even more pressing and ur-
gent. The Tenth onference took s ecial pains
to reem hasize the importance of t e economic
responsi ilities of the system and to suggest meas-
ures for the strengthening of that body. The In-
ter-American Economic and Social Council which
contributed so signally to the success of the Fourth
Meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs in Wash-
ington in 1951, in connection with emergency
measures arising out of the Korean crisis has been
entrusted, as you know, with the diﬁicult and
highly important task of preparing for the Meet-
in of Mlnisters of Finance or Economy, to be
he d in Rio de J aneiro later this year. This, to
my mind, demonstrates the esteem in which the
Council is held. It is truly a forum in which all
of our countries can discuss their economic prob-
lems, and it is m hope that, as a result of its work
in coming mont s, a wide area of agreement will
be worked out even before the Ministers assemble
in Brazil.
My own experience and knowledge of the work-
ings of this regional organization of the American
States has been very brief—if somewhat intensive.
However short, it has been most im ressive. This
process of education has conﬁrmed or me concepts
about the relationshi s among the independent
nations of this hemisphere which I have developed
in a number of years of active work which carried
me at one time or another to many of the countries
on represent. I hope before many months to
ave Vlsited or revisited all of your countries.
The concepts and principles which give mean-
ing to our inter-American relationship are all em-
bodied in the charter of the Organization. What
these things mean in practice, however, is that
the representatives of 21 governments, countries
which are divergent in many signiﬁcant respects,
can and do meet together, whether in an inter-
American conference or here in this Council
Chamber, with mutual respect stemming from
equality before the law; with a willingness to
listen to differing or completely opposing points
of view; with conﬁdence that aggression among
the members of the community is a thing of the
past; and without fear that the more powerful
will interfere in the sovereign affairs of the small-
est. The relationship which has been built among
the nations of this hemisphere is unique in the
history of the world. Let us preserve it and hope
that, by example, it will continue to illustrate to
the rest of the world the validity of Bolivar’s pro-
