Elements of ﬁve Chinese Communist Forces armies con-
tinued to attack along the KUMSONG Salient during
mid-July, raising the intensity and strength of enemy ac-
tion to a new high for the last two years of the war. The
western front remained relatively quiet during the period
while the eastern front ﬂared anew with North Korean
troops attacking United Nations Command positions soulh
of KOSONG and astride the SOYANG Valley, South of
SOHUI. From the armistice on 27 July until the end of
the period, no activity of signiﬁcance was reported across
the front, with the exception of numerous sightings of
enemy work details in the forward areas.
Enemy activity across the western front again was
centered around several United Nations Command outpost
positions near PUNJI and Outpost BETTY, south of
SANGNYONG. Additionally, Just prior to the end of
the previous period, the enemy launched a battalion-size
attack against Outpost BETTY.
In a United Nations Command division sector near
PUNJI little activity was noted early in the period. In
this sector late on 19 July an undetermined-size enemy
force attacked and occupied Outposts BERLIN and E.
BERLIN. These positions were still in the enemy‘s hands
at the armistice signing. East of PUNJI an enemy regi-
ment heavily supported with artillery and mortar attacked
United Nations Command main line of resistance positions
on 24 July. Friendly elements counterattacked early on
25 July and restored lost positions. Later in the morning
an enemy company launched another attack in the same
area. After a brief ﬁreﬁght the enemy was forced to
withdraw. Sporadic ﬁring continued until another enemy
company renewed the assault early on 26 July. The
enemy was forced to withdraw after approximately one
hour of intense ﬁghting. Late in the period the United
Nations Command defenders in this sector experienced a
number of platoon-size probes, all of which withdrew
after brief exchanges of ﬁre. The adjacent United Na-
tions Command division to the east remained exceedingly
quiet with no enemy initiated action occurring that was
larger than several squads in size.
South of SANGNYONG in another United Nations Com-
mand division sector enemy initiated action centered
around Outpost BETTY. The Communists launched six
attacks of platoon size or larger against the outpost in
attempts to occupy the position. The last attack, of
company-size, was the only one in which the enemy had
any success. In this engagement the Chinese assaulted
the United Nations Command position on 25 July and
after nine hours of vicious ﬁghting the enemy force oc-
cupied the center and western portions of the outpost.
Sporadic ﬁghting continued throughout the afternoon of
25 July with the United Nations Command regaining con-
trol of the central portion of the position.
In another United Nations Command division sector
east of SANGNYONG, enemy activity decreased to a
marked degree from the bitter ﬁghting of the previous
period. Only two company and two platoon-size enemy
initiated actions were reported. These actions were con-
centrated against Outposts WESTVIEW and DALE, none
of which were signiﬁcant and the enemy withdrew after
brieﬁy probing United Nations Command positions.
As indicated previously, the Chinese launched their
KUMSONG Bulge attack on 13 July and continued to
expand initial successes during the period. The weight
of the action was against the center and eastern portions
of the central front. Elsewhere across the central front,
enemy activity was of a lesser intensity.
North of CHORWON in a United Nations Command
division sector, enemy activity was insigniﬁcant. How-
ever to the east, the adjacent United Nations Command
division experienced nine company or larger size attacks
between 16—20 July. The remainder of the period in this
sector was relatively quiet. Early on 16 July a Chinese
company unsuccessfully attacked positions of this United
Nations Command division west of KUMHWA. Smaller
enemy probes were initiated concurrently in adjacent
areas. These actions were followed with three attacks of
company to battalion-size across the United Nations Com-
mand division front on the night of 16—17 July. Action
was further intensiﬁed in this area on the subsequent
night when the enemy mounted two battalion and two
company-size attacks. Although hand-to-hand ﬁghting
resulted, the enemy was forced to withdraw after periods
ranging from a few minutes to four hours. Two nights
later the enemy again employed a company against the
positions of this United Nations Command division.
Hand-to-hand combat raged over positions, the depleted
enemy force was compelled to withdraw, however, after
several hours of intense battle. Until the armistice, small
enemy groups intermittently probed these positions.
South of KUMSONG United Nations Command element!
deployed across most of the central front continued to
tight determinedly to contain and repel enemy attacks.
These attacks commenced on the night of 13 July when
the Chinese with ﬁve armies massed between KUMHWA
and the PUKHAN River, launched wave upon wave of
assault infantry against United Nations Command posi-
tions along the KUMSONG Salient. Initially the enemy
employed elements of five divisions in the assault and
by the close of the battle eight divisions from the ﬁve
Chinese Communist Forces armies had been identiﬁed.
This enemy attack resulted in the loss to the United
Nations Command of the KUMSONG Salient and required
a major readjustment of United Nations Command front
line defenses.
In one United Nations Command division sector, east of
KUMHWA, the enemy launched ﬁve attacks of battalion
to regimental-size against United Nations Command de~
fenders. These enemy actions were concentrated on 15
and 16 July and were a continuation of the large limited
objective attack launched by the Chinese against the
KUMSONG Bulge on 13 July. Throughout these heavy
attacks on 15 and 16 July the United Nations Command
defenders fought bitterly to retain every position, how-
ever, under the weight of the Communist onslaught, sev-
eral outpost positions were relinquished and the United
Nations Command was forced to withdraw slightly to
compensate for minor penetrations of the United Nations
Command main line of resistance. By midnight 16 July
all action had ceased and until the armistice only a
scattering of small probes and one minor company attack
were reported.
South of KUMSONG in another United Nations Com-
mand division sector the action continued heavy from the
previous period as a result of the large scale attacks by
the Chinese on 13 July. The action of an enemy division
attack reported in the previous period against this United
Nations Command division continued on through 17 July.
Subsequently, there was a slackening of activity in this
sector until early on 22 July. During the next four days
the Chinese mounted eight company and battalion-size
attacks against elements of this United Nations Command
division. Although the United Nations Command de-
fenders were forced to withdraw from several outposts
there were no large scale withdrawals from critical terrain
and the Chinese were eventually compelled to withdraw
their depleted assault units. Brief enemy probes were
experienced by these friendly elements until 27 July but
no breach in the United Nations Command position was
made.
At the beginning of the period south of KUMSONG a
United Nations Command division fought to contain the
Chinese southward drive of 13 July. On 18 and 19 July
the enemy initiated seven company and battalion-size
actions against elements of this United Nations Command
division, forcing the United Nations Command to give
ground to the numerically superior Chinese. However,
by 20 July the tide of the battle began to change and
friendly elements took the offensive to regain a portion
of the ground lost. Remnants of the enemy assault force
began a withdrawal to the north and the United Nations
Command was able to re-establish a ﬁrm defense. No
further enemy attacks were experienced in this sector
until the enemy launched a two company-size attack
shortly after daybreak on 23 July. The enemy was re-
