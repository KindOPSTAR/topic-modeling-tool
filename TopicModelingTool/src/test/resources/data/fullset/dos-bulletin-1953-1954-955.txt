would obtain a constant and adequate ﬂow of
qualiﬁed young men and women representing the
best cross section of American life. Under this
program, members of Congress would in the fu-
ture have a art in selecting the candidates for
the Foreign Service Corps, much as they now do
for West Point and Annapolis.
I have issued instructions to initiate these for-
wardlooking recommendations. Speciﬁcally, I
have taken the following actions:
1. By signing certain orders, I have accepted as
valid your central recommendation that those of-
ﬁcers of the Departmental home service and the
Foreign Service who perform similar and related
functions should be integrated into one personnel
system. Such a system, as you point out, can
fortunately be built, in large part, on the excel-
lent existing statutory foundatlon of the Foreign
Service Act of 1946.
2. I believe, with the Committee, that the na-
tional interest dictates the creation of a Foreign
Service Ofﬁcer Corps (Fso) that is more ﬂexible
and broadly versatile than at present. We must
take into particular account the need for special-
ized skills in the solution of the vastly complex
problems of today. I have directed that this be
one.
3. I have accepted the Committee’s recommen-
dation that a substantial number of Departmental
positions, probably about 1,450, be (1681 nated for
staﬂin by the F so Corps, and that t e present
incumbents of those positions be encouraged to
enter the new Foreign Service to serve at home or
abroad, as the Department’s needs require.
4. I also agree that all ofﬁcer positions abroad
under the Chiefs of Mission should be similarly
designated, and members of the Foreign Service
Reserve (F SR) Corps and such of the Foreign
Service Staff (lFss) Corps as presently hold those
positions shou d likewise be encouraged to enter
the Fso group.
5. I have endorsed the Committee’s recommen-
dations that a revised and liberalized examination
rocess should be instituted to effect these trans-
ers, which I expect will raise the strength of the
F so Corps from about 1,300 to nearly 4,000.
6. I have issued instructions to consult with
appropriate members of the Congress regarding
t e Committee’s report and its recommendations
with the objective of puttin into eﬁect as quickly
as possible the fundamenta recommendations of
the Committee related to the roposed integra-
tion program. I understand rom your report
that certain minor amendments to existing legis-
lation will be necessary to carry out this program.
7. I have also directed that action be taken to
seek legislative authority for the scholarship pro-
gram roposed by the Committee. This rogram,
provi ing for two-year scholarship awar s to out-
standing young men and women after competitive
examinations, would insure the constant renewal

of the Foreign Service from colleges in all parts
of the country. It seems to me that the scholar-
ship program is a most important and unique
feature of the Committee’s recommendations.
8. I ee with the Committee that Con-
gressiona appointment to the competitions for
the majority of these scholarships is desirable,
vilrlith the Executive Branch having an appropriate
s are.
9. Since the scholarship training program will
require legislative sanction and, in any case, will
take time to initiate, there is need for immediate
and interim action. I am particularly gratiﬁed
that the Committee considered this factor, and I
have adopted the recommendations to modernize
and s eed up the examining and appointment
procedhres for Foreign Service ofﬁcers of the
beginning grade.
10. I have endorsed your recommended steps to
insure that entering ofﬁcers will be truly repre-
sentative young men and women, from all sections
of our country.
11. I agree with the Committee’s anal sis of the
importance of the training function 0 the For-
ei n Service Institute in preparing our diplomatic
ofﬁcers for their tasks, and for inculcating in them
the skills and knowledge so necessary in the prac-
tice of present day foreign affairs. To this end,
I have accepted your recommendations for
strengthening the Institute so that it will have a
status more nearly equivalent to that of our war
colleges, as envis1oned b the Congress when it
enacted the Foreign Servwe Act of 1946.
12. I am completel in agreement with the
Committee’s views on t e importance of establish-
ing a true career development system, especially
as reﬂected in the training and assignment of the
Department’s personnel. Only through the exist-
ence of such a system can the De artment attract
and hold the highly qualiﬁed an dedicated body
of men and women who must make up our pro-
fessional service.
These, it seems to me, are the basic recommenda-
tions of the Committee, and they will be at into
effect as rapid] as ossible. There are,o course,
a few other etai ed recommendations dealing
with personnel administration which require
further study by myself and the other senior oﬁi-
cers of the Department. I have in mind such
suggestions as those concerning the inspection
function, allowances and retirement beneﬁts, and
leave and salary adjustments. I shall see that
this study is vigorously carried forward.
I am lad to have the Committee’s endorsement
of the Iggepartment’s present effort to complete its
security screening program as quickly as possible.
We shall continue that effort, and shall equally,
of course, continue to insure that this program
is administered with the most careful fairne$
and objectivity.
Please allow me to express to you, and to the
other members of the Committee, my appreciation
