(2) a policy of encouragement of diversiﬁca-
tion of the economies of the countries now exces-
sively dependent upon a small number of products,
and of encouragement of the overnments of those
countries to pursue policies ikely to attract for-
eign investors to participate in the works of
diversiﬁcation ;
(3) avoidance of actions incidental to our own
commodity control and stockpile pro ams that
would have avoidably disruptive e ects upon
world prices;
(4) continued consultation and cooperation
with other nations to improve knowledge of world
supply and demand for materials and foodstuffs,
and to e lore possible means of lessening insta-
bility; an
(5) olicies which will tem r the ﬂuctuations
of our omestic economy, whic exert great inﬂu-
ence upon the course of world prices.
United States Dependence on
Imported Materials
RAW MATERIALS
The Commission believes that the most effective
contribution which the United States Government
can make to the development of the foreign sources
of raw materials in which we and the free nations
generally are deﬁcient, is to follow policies favor-
able toward rivate investment abroad (as recom-
mended earlier in this report), and to advocate
among nations adherence to principles and prac-
tices hospitable to foreign investors and conducive
to thrift and investment by their own nationals.
One principle in particular must be stressed: In-
vestors in the development of sources of needed
materials must be assured a ainst frustration _of
their ventures by unpredictab e or capricious levies
on exports or Eroduction by the countries of origin.
Also our tari policy toward the needed materials
should be such as to offer them reasonably easy
access to the United States market.
“CUIITY CONSIDERATIONS
The Commission recommends that tariffs or
other import restrictions on raw materials should
be determined on economic grounds. Upon a
ﬁnding b the Executive that it is necessary on
solely mi itary grounds to assure a strictly do-
mestic source of supply, the Commissmn recom-
mends that the urpose should be accomplished
by other means, t 0 cost of which should be borne
in the defense budget.
Tarltls and Trade Pellcy
The Buy American Act and legislative provi-
sions of other acts containing the Buy American
principle should be amended to ive authority to
the President to exempt from tie proviSions of
such legislation the bidders from other nations
that treat our bidders on an equal basis with their
own nationals. Pending such amendment, the
President by Executive Order should direct pro-
curement agencies in the public interest to con-
sider foreign bids which satisfy all other con-
siderations on substantially the same price basis
as domestic bids.
Congress should direct the President to have the
Tariff Commission undertake a study of the tariﬁ
schedules immediately, with the stated purpose
of framing roposals for the simpliﬁcation of
commodity eﬁnitions and rate structures; this
study should be com leted within a deﬁnite time
period and the Tari Commission should be pro-
vided during this period with an appropriately
enlarged staff. Congress should empower the
President, on the baSis of such recommendations,
to proclaim such changes in commodity deﬁni-
tions and changes in rates as he determines to be
appro riate, provided that such changes do not
materially alter the total of duties collected pur-
suant to any group of rates affected by such
simplifying changes when calculated on imports
in a speciﬁed base period.
The Department of the Treasury should formu-
late roposals designed to simplify the problem
of c assifying articles not enumerated in our
tariff schedules. To that end, consideration
should be given to eliminating the multiple and
conﬂicting standards which now ap ly in the
classiﬁcation of such articles, such as ‘ similitude”
and “component of chief value,” and developing a
single standard of classiﬁcations for the widest
practicable application.
The Senate should prompt] consider H. R.
6584 now before it, which woude amend and im-
rove the customs valuation provisions of our law
y eliminating so-called “foreign value” as a basis
of valuation and by other simplifying changes.
In addition, the Department of the Treasury
should be directed to make a stud and report to
the Congress on the feasibility and effect of mak-
ing greater use of the actual invoice price of im-
ported goods for valuation pur oses in transac-
tions between a buyer and a sel er who are inde-
pendent of each other. In that connection it
should also consider and report upon the feasi-
bility of making more efﬁcient use of the “anti-
dumpin ” law.
The epartment of the Treasury should be di-
rected to make a continuin study of difﬁculties
and delays in customs administration and to report
the results of its studies each ear to the Congress,
together with any proposals or legislative action.
a. The ﬁrst of the regular re orts herein recom-
mended should indicate those etailed administra-
tive provisions of the tariff laws which should be
modiﬁed so that adequate discretion can be granted
to the Secretary of the Treasury to insure the
greatest possible speed and efficiency of adminis-
tration in the operation of customs.
