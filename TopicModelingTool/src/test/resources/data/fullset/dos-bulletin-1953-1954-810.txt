United Nations so that peoples in underdeveloped
countries will at last have a chance to develop a
standard of life in which starvation, undernour-
ishment, and disease are no longer the chief char-
acteristics and thus to develop the strength to
stand up for themselves.
United Nations technical assistance programs
thus strengthen the free world in the long run. In
such countries as Pakistan, Afghanistan, and
Libya, for example, United Nations projects in
land reclamation, irrigation, hydroelectric power,
and other kinds of economic development are
doing big things. Technical assistance carried on
by many nations together under the auspices of
the United Nations results in a greater participa-
tion by other countries and a greater good will for
the United States. The President’s Commission
on Foreign Economic Policy, the Randall Com-
mission, urges, therefore, that the United Nations
program of technical assistance be strengthened
and expanded.
