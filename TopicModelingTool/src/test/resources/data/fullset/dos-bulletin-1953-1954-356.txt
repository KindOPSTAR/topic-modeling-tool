Elleetlveness of Operatlon "Boot Strap”
I look back on my earl days as a volunteer
social worker and I recall t e overty, the misery,
and the i uorance in some of, the areas where I
worked. ut I am equally conscious of the im-
provements that have been made, not on] in
those areas but all through the world. 0th
Columbus and Lincoln today would praise and
marvel at the advances you have made. They
would join, I am sure, with me in paying tribute
to this tremendous economic, social, and educa-
tional advance that you have made in recent years.
We all know this came about in large measure as
a result of the wise use which you have made of
the initial help which we were able to give and
upon which, on your own initiative, you have
developed local education and leadership, all of
which has demonstrated its effectiveness in opera-
tion Boot Strap.
As your Governor has said : “By these operations
we are improving man’s stay on earth—not only
the making of a better living for man but more
im ortant the making of a better life.”
t us for a minute now discuss the last session
of the United Nations General Assembly. Con-
tributing in a distin ished way to this last session
was the Resident ommissioner ‘in Washington,
Dr. Antonio Fernos-Isern. He performed a great
service on the U. S. delegation where he was
s okesman for the United States when the Puerto
ican item was discussed in Committee IV of the
General Assembly."1 My assignments at the last
General Assembly were concerned mostly with the
work in the social and humanitarian field, but I
also was very much interested in the United Na-
tions technical assistance program—which re-
sembles a great deal the point 4 program—pro-
ams which do not make the headlines, as Mr.
shinsky tting off and on a boat usually makes
a headline, ut programs which are really helping
to wipe out the root causes of war and communism.
Hen Ford II, who served on the US. delega-
tion an served in a remarkable way—I wish you
could have heard his remarks one day in Commit-
tee II, when the Russian delegate said that the
United States was doomed to an economic depres-
sion—was talking about the so-called democracy
in the capitalistic country. Henry Ford said he
couldn’t speak for all the businessmen of the
United States, but he could speak for the automo-
bile manufacturers, and he knew they were going
to have a big year; and he said: “The Russian
delegate points out that the United States is in a
very bad way ﬁnancially, but,” said Henry Ford,
“1 have just been in another Committee where the
budget is being discussed, and all countries are
agreeing that the United States share of the budget
should be lowered and Russia’s share should
be lifted; and,” said Henry Ford, “the Russian

delegate has just pointed out in that Committee
that Russia is so badly off and the United States
is so well off they don’t think there should be a
change in the budget.” Henry Ford made this
remark in handling this program in that Commit-
tee: “We all recognize that the continued existence
of Very low living standards in large areas of the
world is unhealthy. We know that the existence
of vast depressed areas is a heavy drag on the
whole world economy. The American people,
who have experienced the beneﬁts of a vigorous
and prosperous economy, have a real stake in the
development of similar situations abroad. \Ve are
not interested in exploiting anyone. \Ve are in-
terested in the mutual advanta es which ﬂow from
an unfettered exchan e of skil s, goods, and ideas
with other peoples. his is neither altruism nor
imperialism—it is simply enlightened self-
interest.”

We cannot speak of technical assistance pro-
grams without referring to Dr. Rafael Pico,
Chairman of the Puerto Rican Planning Board,
who is now in India as an expert adviser attending
the United Nations International Seminar being
held in New Delhi. A great humanitarian, he is
contributing to the welfare of the world. I
thought I would like to ive you an example of one
project that the United ations pro am is carry-
mg forward. Cha-Choen -Sao a ut 60 miles
from Bangkok, is the site 0 an old Buddhist mon-
astery. In Thailand, teaching has been, and is,
the traditional function of the priests. That per-
haps may be why they selected the temple for the
experts from many countries to work on this, to
mix and mingle with the ellow-robed priests,
workin to the tinkle of temple bells on this project
in Thai and.
Their goal is the reformation of the whole edu-
cational system in Thailand, and the team working
in Thailand includes a New Zealand expert in
fundamental education, a primary school special-
ist from Denmark, a specialist in language teach-
ing, a vocational training expert from the United
Kingdom, and a science teacher from the United
States. There are other experts from the Nether-
lands and two from Norway—the United Nations
in miniature.
In addition specialists from the World Health
Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organ-
ization, and the International Labor Organization
are working on the project, coordinating the pro-
gram with the practical life of the people, carry-
ing the ﬁght on ignorance into the ﬁght on hunger
and disease.
‘Vhen we speak of these United Nations pro-
grams helping people to help themselves—these
pilot projects—let’s not forget your programs
here. For example, your program in aided self-
