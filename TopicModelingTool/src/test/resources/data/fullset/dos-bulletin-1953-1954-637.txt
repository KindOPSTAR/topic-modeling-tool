Meeting of MAC Ministers
TEXT OF COMMUNIQUE OF APRIL 23
At a ministerial meeting held in Paris today,
ﬁve years after the treaty was signed, the North
Atlantic Council reviewed the progress made by
the organization, examined the present interna-
tional situation, and exchanged views on problems
of common interest. The meeting was attended by
the Foreign Ministers of the member governments
under the chairmanship of M. Bidault.
The Vice-Chairman and Secretary General,
Lord Ismay, reported on the work of the organi-
zation. His survey emphasized the effective work-
ing relationship developing within the alliance, a
re ationship which goes beyond the formal obli-
gations assumed by its members. The Foreign
Iinisters took this opportunity to reafﬁrm their
association in the Atlantic alliance as fundamental
to the policies of their respective governments.
Recalling the defensive and peaceful aims of the
treat , they ex ressed their resolve to maintain and
deve o the al iance not only as the ﬁrm basis for
the col ective defense of their peoples, but also as
an enduring association for common action and
piopgeration between the member states in every
e .
After discussing international developments
since its last meeting, the council found no evidence
that the ultimate aims of the Soviet Union had
altered, and noted that the military strength of
the Soviet Union and its satellites continues to in-
crease. The council therefore once more agreed
upon the need for continuing efforts, vigilance and
unity.
The council—reafﬁrming its long-established po-
sition that the institution of the European Defense
Community is in the essential interest of the alli-
ance—welcomed the ratiﬁcation of the EDC
treaty by a number of the si natories since the last
Ministerial Meeting, which rings closer the entry
into force of the treaty. The council also expressed
its gratiﬁcation at the far-reaching steps taken by
the Governments of the United Kin dom and
United States towards cooperation wit the Eu-
ropean Defense Community,1 thus ensuring their
lasting and close association with the defense of
the continent of Europe.
With regard to the recent declaration by the
Soviet Government on the status of their zone of
occupation in Germany,” the council noted with
approval that member governments of the organ-
ization had no intention of recognizing the sov-
ereignty of the so-called German Democratic
Republic or of treating the German authorities
there as a government. It decided that the per-
manent representatives should draw up a resolu-
tion on this subject.
The council, with a view to developing further
the habit of political consultation in the council,
adopted a resolution on that subject, the text of
which has been published separately.8
The council paid tribute to .the gallantry of the
French Union forces ﬁghting in Indochina. It
expressed the hope that the Geneva Conference will
have positive results.

tion, see ibid., Apr. 5, 1954, p. 511.
‘The resolution recommends “(A) that all member
governments should bear constantly in mind the desire.-
bility of bringing to the attention of the Council infor-
mation on international political developments whenever
they are of concern to other members of the Council or to
the Organization as a whole; and (B) that the Council.
in permanent session should from time to time consider
what speciﬁc subject might be suitable for political con-
sultation at one of its subsequent meetings when its mem-
bers should be in a position to express the views of their
governments on this subject."
