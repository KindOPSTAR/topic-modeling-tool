was signed in 1951. At that time Earl Warren,
then Governor of California, said:
It has been my privilege during the past few weeks to
visit Japan and I have returned convinced that, given the
opportunity and sympathetic assistance. Japan is in a
position to contribute mightily to the type of leadership
which the cause of peace now needs so desperately.
Your Mayor, the Honorable Elmer E. Robin-
son, remindin the world that San Francisco had
cradled the nited Nations in its beginning,
spoke of the work then “so nobly begun. “You
are,” he told the delegates, “met to advance that
work . . . to expand the area of peace and to re-
store Japan to the community of sovereign nations
dedicated to the common good of all mankind.”
Dash of U. 8. Policy
United States policy in Japan is based on the
conviction that the Japanese “restored to the com-
munity of sovereign nations” can indeed advance
the cause of peace in Asia. Today there is repre-
sentative government in Japan. That overn-
ment is composed of men with faith in idea s dedi-
cated to the welfare of the eople and to securing
for their country a place 0 dignity and honor in
the free world and a voice in the affairs of men.
Japanese skills in the arts of the 20th century
can serve as a model for all Asia. The products of
those skills are needed by her fellow Asians, but
even more she can be of value as an exporter of the
industrial revolution, of its science, its technology
its skills, its know-how—to use a much overworked
term.
The Communists, of course, see Japan in their
usual perverted light. They, too, would use her,
but for their own selﬁsh purposes. To serve those
purposes they are exerting ever effort to turn
her against the United States an the free world.
Communist propaganda in Japan follows the
usual attern. They lay upon revivin national-
ism. ey have launc ed a cam aign o misrepre-
sentation and hate of the nited States of
America. They exploit Japan’s ancient and tra-
ditional distrust of foreigners. They attack and
try to discredit pro-U. S. A. statesmen.
Outside of Japan, the Communists foster anti-
Japanese feeling left over from the war. They are
ver busy in the Philippines, Indonesia, Burma,
Ma aya, and elsewhere where memory of the J ap-
anese occupation is still fresh.
In the United States itself they have not been
idle. \Ve are reminded of Pearl Harbor, of
Bataan, of Japanese abuse of war prisoners.
Wherever there is a bitter memory—and there
are many—the Communists work to keep old
wounds smarting, old hatreds alive.
And trul , to quote again Chief Justice Warren,
“Never be ore in history have victors been so
magnanimous with the vanquished—never before
in history have the conquered been so encouraged
to regain their normal status of dignity and self-
esteem.”
In Europe it is often said that the Americans
could forgive because they had not, personally,
suffered so deeply. \Vhatever may be said about
that in Asia is certainly not true. We do, indeed,
have much to forgive. That we have forgiven
will, I am conﬁdent, stand forever to our credit.
Our ho es for Ja )an are based fundamentally
on our belief and fait in human bein It is part
and parcel of our basic philosophy. t isn’t a ques-
tion of benevolence. It is rather a matter of faith.
In the occupation we worked, to be sure, with the
Japanese leaders. But we reached beyond them to
the people. Our aim was to give the individual
Japanese—men and women, farmer and industrial
worker, artisan and professional man—a stake in
freedom.
We believe we have done that. And our foreign
policy toward Japan is based on that belief.
There is, of course, so much yet to be done. The
Japanese economy should be made independent.
It is today dependent, in lar e part, upon the
United States. We have, in act, since the end
of hostilities invested billions of dollars in Japa-
nese recovery, but our Japanese friends want to
be independent and to see their country stand on
its own feet.
To a country lacking in natural resources the
answer is trade. Japan’s industrial output musti
ﬁll the gap.
Trade with Communist China is not exclusively
the answer. Today Japan’s controls on trade
with China are more stringent than those of some
other ma'or tradin countries The United
States an Canada 0% course have com lete em-
bargoes. But even in 1934-1935 when t are were
no restrictions, trade with China was on] 10
percent of the total exports. Consequent y, a
relaxation of present controls would hardly solve
J a an’s economic roblems.
apan needs do] ars so that she ma buy in the
United States. She wants to earn t ese dollars.
She can do so only by selling her oods to us.
I am not unaware of the prob ems involved in
this question. But the answer does not lie in shut-
ting our doors to Japanese goods. Perhaps no
decision the United States makes in 1954 will be
more crucial than those we make with respect to
im orts. To Ja an, they will be all-important.
apan would 1i e to trade with Southeast Asia,i
the source of many of her raw materials. It is to
the interest of the United States to encourage that
trade although it may put Japanese producers in
competition with those of the United States as
well as with other nations of the free world.
It is my conviction, however, that the area
offers room for all of us. The Far East, as a whole,
contains about a third of the world’s population.
That is nearly a billion people. Their needs are
great. No one country alone could hope to ﬁll
them. By all means let them open their doors to
Japan. It means economic health for that coun-
try and added security to the free world.
