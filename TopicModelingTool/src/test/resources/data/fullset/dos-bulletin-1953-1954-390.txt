U.S. NOTE OF JANUARY 26
REGARDING III—50 INCIDENT
Excuumcr: The Embassy of the United States of
America presents its compliments to the Ministry for For-
eign Affairs of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and,
upon instructions from its Government, has the honor to
state the following:
The Government of the United States of America refers
to the notes of the Government of the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics of July 30 and August 4, 1953,‘ and to
the note of the United States Government to the Soviet
Government dated August 4, 1953,‘ and in particular to the
Soviet Government's note of August 26, 1953,‘ all of which
concern the destruction by the Soviet Government of an
American military RB-50 aircraft over the Sea of Japan
on July 29, 1953.
This matter has continued to receive the careful and
serious attention of the United States Government, both
because of the United States Government's concern with
the fate of the crew members of the destroyed aircraft and
because of the implications which the Soviet Government‘s
conduct in this and similar prior incidents suggests con-
cerning the respect for international law and order which
may be expected from the Soviet Government now and in
the future. In the light of further investigation and study
of the incident of July 29, 1953, which the United States
Government has been making, the Soviet Government‘s
notes in this matter, particularly the relatively detailed
note of August 26, 1953, must be characterized as inade-
quote.
The United States Government desires, before consider-
ing further action, to receive from the Soviet Government
first, explicit and unambiguous details of the Soviet Gov-
ernment's claims as to the facts and the applicable prop-
ositions of law and, secondly, the latest evidence which
the Soviet Government may possess or have available hear-
ing on the question of survivors from the RB-50 crew.
The Soviet Government is requested to communicate to
the United States Government at the Soviet Government‘s
earliest convenience the following detailed information:
A. As to the incident of July 29, 1953, the Soviet Govern-
ment should give, without ambiguous or indeﬁnite quali-
fication, the precise and exact positions, by coordinates of
latitude and longitude, at which the Bil-50 is claimed by
the Soviet Government to have been when the Soviet Gov-
ernment took each of the actions involved in the destruction
of the aircraft.
The statements in the above-cited notes of the Soviet
Government as to these positions are vague and am-
biguous. The United States Government cannot respond
properly to these assertions unless the Soviet Government
makes its points more deﬁnite and more certain.
For example, the Soviet Government states in its note
of August 26, 1953 that “ground observation" showed that
the 118—50 which was shot down “violated the state
boundary of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics first
in the region of Cape Gamov and continued to ﬂy over
territory of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in
the vicinity of Askold Island not far from Vladivostok."
The Soviet Government fails to state, it will be noticed,
(a) precisely where it claims the state boundary of the
Soviet Union runs in this area, (b) precisely where it
claims the alleged violation of that boundary took place,

and (c) the precise positions it claims the BIS—50 was
when it was first intercepted and then when it was shot.
Speciﬁcally, the Soviet Government is requested to
inform the United States Government:
1. The position by latitude and longitude coordinates
where the Soviet Government claims the 38-50 aircraft
crossed into Soviet territory "in the region of Cape
Gamov."
2. The precise course by latitude and longitude coordi-
nates-which the Soviet Government claims the liB-50
flew “in the vicinity of Askold island."
3. Whether ground observation, on the basis of which
the position of the 1113-50 was ﬂXed by Soviet authorities,
was made by radar or by direct visual observation of the
aircraft. In case the claim of the Soviet Government is
based on radar observation, the Soviet Government should
provide, duly authenticated, copies of the logs and re-
ports of the radar observers. In case it is based on re-
ports of direct visual contact, the Soviet Government
should provide in the original version, duly authenticated.
the full statements made by the observers.
4. 1f the Soviet Government claims that the ﬂight of
the 118-50 was continuously observed before and after.
a well as during, the time it was alleged to have crossed
the boundary of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Government
should provide the upporting logs and reports of the
observers, duly authenticated, including both radar and
visual observation.
5. With respect to the intercepting Soviet aircraft. the
Soviet Government is requeetcd to state whether these
aircraft were during and following the time of inter-
ception under the supervision of Soviet authorities or the
direction of ground controllers and whether instructions
were given to the pilots of the intercepting aircraft con-
cerning the action to be taken by them electing the 1113—50;
and to provide the United States with duly authenticated
copies of (a) all communications between the aircraft
and supervisory Soviet authorities respecting the inter-
ception, (b) all radar and radio logs bearing on, or re-
ﬂecting, the interception and on the actions of the Soviet
pilots and the controllers, and (c) all reports submitted
by the pilots, whether in writing or orally.
6. With respect to the alleged warning of Soviet aircraft
to the RB-50, the Soviet note is not clear as to whether
the Soviet Government claims any attempt was made to
warn the Bil-50 to leave Soviet territory prior to its
destruction by Soviet ﬁghters. In this regard the Soviet
Government is requested to describe, with specificity and
detail, the precise actions which were taken by the Soviet
personnel involved (whether in the air or on the ground)
to communicate, prior to the firing at it. any warning at
all to the RB-50, or any suggestion to it that it was ﬂying
over Soviet territory and that it should leave the air
space. Among the precise actions above mentioned which
the Soviet Government is requested to dcscrihe are i a) the
altitudes at which the Soviet aircraft ﬂew with reference
to the Bil-50 aircraft, before, during and after inter-
ception; (b) the attitudes and directions of approach
which the Soviet aircraft made in effecting each com-
munication with and interception of the Bil-50.
7. With respect to the actual shooting, which it is noted
the Soviet Government apparently claims was first begun
by the RB—50, the Soviet Government is requested to
specify the precise position by coordinates of latitude and
longitude, and the precise time sequence at which each
of the various bursts of ﬁre were made. distinguishing
chronologically bursts of fire claimed to have been made
by the Bil—50 aircraft from those by the Soviet ﬁghters.
8. With respect to the 1113-50 aircraft, it is noted that
the Soviet Government has indicated that it claims that
the 313-50, after being shot by Soviet ﬁghters, went off
"in the direction of the sea." The Soviet Government is
requested to inform the United States Government ﬁrst,
whether the Soviet authorities have made any attempt
(a) to ﬁnd the destroyed aircraft or (b) to salvage any
part of the aircraft: and secondly, what the results of
such attempts, if made, were. If salvage was attempted,
