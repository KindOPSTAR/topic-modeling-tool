requirements. I subscribe to the principle that
such support of our merchant ﬂeet as is required
for that purpose should be rovided by direct
means to the greatest possib e extent. Such a
policy, however, requires a careful analysis of
the means available for providing direct support,
its ossible effects on foreign ﬂag vessel carryings,
an its total costs before a speciﬁc program can
be recommended.
The Department of Commerce has alread
studied this problem at length. Its ﬁndin wi 1
be further reviewed within the Executive ranch
in order to develop speciﬁc recommendations to
transmit to the next session of the Congress, in
addition to the proposals submitted by the Execu-
tive Branch that are now before the Congress.
International Travel
International travel has cultural and social im-
portance in the free world. It also has economic
signiﬁcance. Foreign travel by Americans is a
substantial source of dollars for many countries,
enabling them to pay for what we sell them.
While the promotion of tourism is primarily a
responsibility of the countries which welcome vis-
itors, and is a function for private enterprise,
there are some speciﬁc governmental actions which
can be helpful. For example, there is HR. 8352
which increases the duty-free allowance for
tourists from $500 to $1,000, exercisable every 6
months. I recommend its passage. From time
to time I may have other recommendations for
legislative action to stimulate travel.
Meanwhile, in the executive branch I shall
instruct the appropriate agencies and depart-
ments, at home and abroad, to consider how they
can facilitate international travel. They will be
asked to take action to simplify governmental pro-
cedures relating to customs, visas, pass orts, ex-
change or monetary restrictions and ot er regu-
lations that sometimes harass the traveler.
Economic Aid and Technical Assistance
Assistance extended in the past by the United
States to other free nations has layed an effective
part in strengthening the national security, de-
veloping important resources, and opening up sig-
niﬁcant opportunities, for ourselves and for others.
It has a so carried with it, in many instances,
particularly in technical cooperation and famine
relief, a deep humanitarian response by our peo-
le. However, economic aid cannot be continued
indeﬁnitely. We must distinguish between an
emergency and a chronic malady, between a
special case and a eneral rule.
I subscribe, there ore, to the principle that eco-
nomic aid on a rant basis should be terminated
as soon as possi 1e consistent with our national
interest. In cases where support is needed to es-
tablish and equip military forces of other govern-
ments in the interest of our mutual defense, and
where this is beyond the economic capacity of
another country, our aid should be in the form of
grants. As recognized by the Commission, there
may be some cases in which modest amounts of
grant aid to underdeveloped countries will im-
portantly serve the interest of security. I further
a ee that in other situations where the interest
0 the United States requires that dollars not
otherwise available to a country should be pro-
vided, such support to the maximum extent ap-
propriate should be in the form of loans rather
than grants.
In extending such loans, we must be careful not
to interfere with the normal lending activities and
standards of the Ex ort-Import Bank. The In-
ternational Bank is t e primary institution for the
paublic ﬁnancing of economic development. The
xport-Import Bank will consider on their merits
applications for the ﬁnancing of development
projects, which are not being made by the Inter-
national Bank, and which are in the special in-
terest of the United States, are economically
sound, are within the capacity of the prospective
borrower to repay and Within the prudent loaning
capacity of the bank.
I approve the recommendations of the Commis-
sion on Foreign Economic Policy that the United
States participation in technical cooperation pro-
grams shoul be pressed forward vigorously.
uch programs should concentrate on providing
ex erts and know-how rather than large funds or
shipments of goods except for necessary demon-
stration equipment. They should not provide
capital for investment but should be so admin-
istered as to ﬁt into the programs of development
of the assisted countries and they should be re-
lated to any private or public investment likely
to be forthcoming.
Review of the requirements for the Mutual Se-
curity Program has been conducted with these
principles in mind and substantial reductions in
grant aid have been made by this administration.
The legislation which I shall later propose for the
Mutual Security Program will reflect these
principles.
East-West Trade
In viewing the problems of other nations of the
free world, we are forced to recognize that the
economies of some of them have been weakened by
the disruption of the broad historic pattern of
trade between East and West.
Curtailment of our aid rograms will increase
the pressures for resumption of such trade. A
greater exchange of peaceful goods between East.
and West—that is, goods not covered by the Battle
Act nor otherwise considered strategic—so far as
it can be achieved without jeopardizing national
security, and subject to our embargo on Com-
munist China and North Korea, should not cause
