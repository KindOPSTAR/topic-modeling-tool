with that principle. That undertaking applies to
German until she becomes a member.
Mr. olotov has claimed that the North Atlan-
tic Treaty is aimed at the Soviet Union. That
treaty, made pursuant to the United Nations
Charter, contemplates the use of force only if
there is an armed attack against one of the arties.
I hope that Mr. Molotov does not impl t at the
Soviet Union intends to bring that trag y to pass.
If it does not, then it need not fear the treaty.
The Soviet Union, which dominates a milita
bloc of 800 million people, seems to be fearful if
any other nations combine for their defense. The
reasons for such combination are simple, and the
combination conceals nothing sinister.
If any one of the Western Euro ean nations
were alone to be strong enough to Idefend itself
against possible attack from the Soviet bloc, it
would from an internal standpoint endanger its
economy and from an external standpoint, en-
danger its neighbors.
T e Soviet Union proposes that Germany
should be allowed to have defensive strength on
a national basis. But if Germany had national
forces strong enough to defend itself from external
attack, it would be so strong that it would threaten
all of Western Europe.
Need for Strength
Through Communlty El'lorts
The only way in which nations can obtain
necessary defensive strength without themselves
becoming an aggressive menace is by community
efforts. Under those circumstances no si 1e
nation is strong enough to attack alone; butntﬁie
combined strength deters aggression. This s s-
tem, it is true, sometimes involves one mem er
of the community helping to maintain deterrent
forces on the territor of another member of the
community. Mr. M0 otov had particularly com-
plained of this aspect of the security arrangements
participated in by the United States, the United
ingdom, and France in cooperation with their
associates. The fact is that such arrangements
are a mighty safeguard against aggression. They
mean that only the combined will of many nations
can set the defensive system into action.
The greatest danger to world peace lies in the
fact that in some cases a vast military establish-
ment can be made to attack by the decision of a
single nation, sometimes indeed by the decision
of a single man. That is a situation which is
understandably terrifying.
But where a military establishment cannot act
without the combined will of man countries, then
only a clear defensive need can brine about the
necessary concurrence of national wil s.
Furthermore, in this way, it is ossible to get
adequate defense without forcin the people, and
particularly the workers, to en er by requiring
them to toil unproductively. It is understandable
that the Soviet Union should want to force on the
free nations a system which will drag down their
higher standard of living. But, we shall have
none of that, Mr. Molotov. We shall have both
security and human welfare.
When I spoke here a week a 0 today, I ointed
out the United States course 0? conduct f0 lowing
World War II.‘ We promptly withdrew our vast
armies and air and naval forces from Europe. We
largely dismantled our military forces to a mere
fraction of about one-tenth of their World \Var II
strength. We reversed that course only when
Communist aggression in Korea aroused us to the
fact of danger. Then, in concert with the many
others who shared our fear, we undertook to re-
create a reasonable defensive posture. Now that
that position is in sight, we are leveling off our
national expenditure for military purposes and
the NATO countries are doing the same.
This conduct cannot be reconciled with any
aggressive purpose.
The Soviet Minister must know that fact. If he
does not admit it, it can only be because he believes
that to misrepresent the truth will serve some
ulterior urpose.
Mr. olotov has rightly said that we live in a
modern age, and should take into account the
lessons or models of modern histoRyr. That is
precisely what we are tryin to do. e are seek-
ing to appclﬁ' in the international ﬁeld these prin-
ciples w 1 every civilized community applies as
amon its members to get peace and security at
beara le cost. That is the effort in which the
United States wholeheartedly joins with others
who are likeminded.
No single act that the United States has taken
or will take carries any threat to the Soviet Union
so long as the Soviet Union itself abides by the
principles of the United Nations to which it has
solemnly subscribed.
Let this conference now get back to the problem
of Germany and of how to welcome and nurture
the desire of the new Germany to ﬁnd for her
energies an outlet which, better than unbridled
nationalism, will serve the needs of Germany, of
Europe and, indeed, of all the world.
STATEMENT OF FEBRUARY 3
Press release 53 dated February 4
I think that we can take satisfaction in the fact
that Mr. Molotov’s remarks have gone to the heart
of the problem which we are discussing here today.
I would have preferred that this discussion would
have been preceded by a more clear statement of
the Soviet proposals, which I had thought Mr.
Molotov had promised us. But even without
that, I would be glad to give a few improm tu
reagtions to the remarks which Mr. Molotov iias
ma e.
