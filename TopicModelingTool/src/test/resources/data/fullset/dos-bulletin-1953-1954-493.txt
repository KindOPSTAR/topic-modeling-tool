JOINT COMMUNIQUE
Press release 117 dated March 8
Japanese Foreign Minister Katsuo Okazaki and
American Ambassador John M. Allison in a cere-
mony held at the Foreign Ofﬁce today signed a
Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement between
Japan and the United States of America. At the
same time they signed a series of three other re-
lated agreements pertaining to the purchase of
agricultural commodities, economic arrangements,
and guaranty of investments, and arrangements
for the return of equipment under the Mutual De-
fense Assistance Agreement.
The Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement
signed today is modeled after similar agreements
between the United States and many other nations
articipating in the Mutual Security Program.
t provides the basis for the grant of assistance
ursuant to the Mutual Security legislation of the
United States, and is designed to facilitate the
planning of a Defense Assistance Program for
Japan with recognition that economic stabilit
of the country is an essential element for considq
eration in developing its defense capacities. The
agreement also contemplates the establishment of
an American MAAG‘ to operate under the direc-
tion and control of the American Ambassador in
Japan. This group will serve in an advisory ca-
pacity to assist and guide the development of
Japanese defense forces. The Japanese Govern-
ment has agreed to provide the sum of yen 357,-
300,000 or approximately $990,000, in addition to
certain contributions in kind, for the purpose of
meeting the expenses of the MAAG.
The arrangements for the return of equipment
are closely related to the MDA agreement, and pro-
vide generally that any equipment furnished to
‘ Military Assistance Advisory Group.
Japan no longer required for the purposes in-
tended shall be returned in accordance with mu-
tually agreed procedures.
The agreement concerning the purchase of agri-
cultural commodities lays the basis for the sale
to Japan of surplus American agricultural proj-
ects of a value not to exceed $50,000,000. Accord-
ing to this agreement, the United States will pa
do lars to purchase the products and J a an wi l
deposit a yen equivalent in the Bank of apan in
favor of the United States. Under the terms of
the agreement on economic arrangements, 20 per-
cent of this deposit or not more than the yen
equivalent of $10,000,000 will be made available
by the United States in the form of yen grants
to Japan for the purpose of assisting Japanese de-
fense industry and for other purposes serving
to promote Japan’s economic ca acities. The re-
mainin 80 percent of this fun will be used by
the United States to procure goods and services in
Japan in support of the Military Assistance Pro-
gram. The a eement concerning investment
guaranties is esigned to provide certain safe-
guards to American businessmen in an effort to
stimulate investments in Japan.
These agreements will be submitted to the Diet
for its actlon and will enter into force when the
United States is notiﬁed of Japan’s ratiﬁcation
or approval of the agreements.
STATEMENT BY AMBASSADOR ALLISON
Press release 119 dated March 8
We are about to sign today a mutual defense
assistance agreement and three allied agreements.
Those ofﬁcers in both our Governments who have
been arduously engaged for so long in the details
of these negotiations deserve our thanks and
congratulations.
There are two points which at the very begin-
ning I wish to emphasize. One is that these are
mutual agreements and secondly, that they are
the result of 8 months of negotiations. These
two facts are interrelated. If these were not
mutual agreements, freely entered into, there
would have been no necessity for 8 months of
negotiations. The very essence of the documents
