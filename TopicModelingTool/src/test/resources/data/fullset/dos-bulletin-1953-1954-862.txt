Figure 4. Human head on seven well-known map
projections
The man’s head shown in figure .3 is here presented on
the following well-known map projections, as if the nose,
eyes, mouth, ears, chin, and cap were land masses: (a)
Mercator projection (because the North and South Poles
are at inﬁnity they cannot be shown on such a, map) ;
(D) Miller cylindrical projection, a mathematical modi-
ﬁcation of the Mercator, with all parallels of latitude
closer together than on Mercator, and with both geograph-
ical poles represented by straight lines as long as the
equator; (c) polar equidistant, the center of construction
being at the North Pole in this instance; (d) azimuthal
equidistant, the center of the projection being at Wash-
ington, D. 0.; (e) Van der Grinten projection; (f) sinus-
oidal equal-area projection, as sometimes interrupted to
avoid breaking the continents; and (a) two azimuthal
equal-area projection hemispheres.
inﬁnite. For Americans it is particularly illumi-
natin to consider a few of the hemis heres which
inclu e all of the United States. undertook
something of this sort in 1945 in a paper entitled
“This Hemisphere”.4 The map illustrations used
with the present article are, With two exceptions,
different.
As a background for consideration of most of
the maps appearin with this article, consider
the seven major “cu ture worlds” that have been
so well deﬁned by Russell and Kniﬁ'en, here out-
lined on a map of world population distribution
on an equal-area projection (ﬁgure 6). Within
the last year all of these seven “culture worlds”
except the Polar world have been the scenes of
special missions of Secretary Dulles, Vice Presi-
dent Nixon, or Milton Eisenhower. In ﬁve of
these culture re ions international conferences
have been atten ed by ofﬁcial dele ates of the
United States within the last year. r. F. S. C.
Northrup, in his recent book, The Taming of the
Nations: A Study of the Cultural Bases of Inter-
national Policg, develops the signiﬁcance of these
culture regions in the constructive evolution of
international relations.
So-Called Western Hemlsphero
Americans sometimes speak as if the one hemi-
sphere in which the United States is located is the
so-called Western Hemis here.
The line separating t e mapmaker’s conven-
tional Western and Eastern Hemispheres is the
pair of meridians 20° west and 160° east of Green-
wich. This line is wholly lacking in geographical
signiﬁcance (figure 7).
It seems a propriate here to speak of the un-
lanned deve opment of our regional terminology.
or several years I have been suggestin the e-
Europeanization of our terminology re atin to
major geographical regions and its universa iza-
tion instead. It is time to be done with “western”
and “eastern hemispheres” and the rest and to
begin em loying terms that are objective and fully
acceptab e to the peo le living in the areas con-
cerned. Perhaps “t e American hemisphere”
should be acceptable for the American continents
and islands, includin Greenland, although the
Americas su port onﬁy about 13 ercent of the
world’s popu ation on 30 percent 0 its land area.
“Middle West” relating to the middle western
United States is, of course, not objectionable, but
I can think of no orientation of the globe that j usti-
ﬁes the terms “Middle East” and “Far East.”
“Eastern Asia,” “Southern” or “South Asia,”
“south central Paciﬁc,” and similar terms are, in
my opinion, preferable from every stand oint.
Incidentally, the adjective and noun “As1atic”
