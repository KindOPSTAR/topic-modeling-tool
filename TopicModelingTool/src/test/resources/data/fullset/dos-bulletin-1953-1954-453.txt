Our Partnershlp With Spain
by James Clement Dunn
Ambassador to Spain 1
First of all, I wish to thank you for our ve
kind invitation to come to Bilbao, “the ittsburg
of Spain” and the heart of a gpeat mining and
industrial region, to meet with usinessmen who
are interested in the mutual roblems and plans of
the Spanish and American overnments.
The impressive economic and industrial record
of your outstanding port on the Nervion is well
known, as is the importance of your metal and
chemical industries here and in the surroundin
rovinces. Also well known are the stability 0
lilbao’s banking institutions and the seriousness
energy, and enterprise of its businessmen an
industrialists.
Besides being the backbone of the Spanish iron
and steel industry and derivatory products the
Bilbao zone contains a blossoming chemical in-
dustry with vast possibilities for ex ansion; and
it has for many years been the distri ution center
for innumerable imported products. In 1953 a
total of 4,368 ships of many nationalities entered
this busy port, and the press has recently reported
that more than a million tons of iron was sold in
Bilbao last year. Shi s made here such as the
Guadalu e, the 0012 0129a, the Monte Urbasa,
and the ante Udala are familiar sights in many
ports of the Americas.
You are fortunate, indeed, to live in an area of
active and prosperous industry surrounded by the
rolling green hills which characterize this great
northwest area of Spain. This part of Spain has
long been known to my country. Many of your
peo 1e have relatives and connections in the
United States. American ships call re larly at
your port, and the ties between us are c ose.
All of you know, I believe, something of the
broad project in which we are now engaged as a
result of the economic and military agreements
signed between our two Governments last Septem-
ber. There are, actually, three agreements. One
provides for the construction and joint use of cer-

tain military facilities in Spain by the United
States. Another calls for American economic
assistance to strengthen Spain’s economy. The
third rovides for military assistance from the
United) States to strengthen the defense ca abil-
ities of the Spanish Army, Navy, and Air orce.’
Under the terms of our recent agreements,
Spain and the United States are not only friends
but also partners—partners in a mutual under-
taking by two sovereign nations to achieve greater
security for each and to protect and preserve their
independence from outside encroachment.
At the same time, our joint efforts are not
basicall anti anything but are constructive and
forwar -looking. The United States has a deep
interest in the long-term economic development of
Europe and greatly desires to help further the
well-being of its peoples. This can be seen from
our policy of extending economic aid and our
further effort to strengthen the economies of
friendly nations by our program of offshore pro_
curement, for which Spain is now eligible. Under
this plan, Spain could produce certain items
needed in the common defense with ﬁnancial sup-
port from the United States.
Three Groups Admlnlster Agreements
As you probably know, there are three distinct
groups set up in Madrid to help organize and
carry out the provisions of the accord with Spain.
There is the MAAG (or Military Assistance Ad-
vistory Group) headed by General Kissner, which,
as its name implies, is concerned with military aid
to the Spanish armed forces. There is the J USMG
(or Joint United States Military Group), also
headed by General Kissner, which is concerned
with the construction of the bases and naval facili-
ties, as provided in the agreement. And there is
the United States Operations Mission in Spain,
to administer the provisions of the agreement con-
