without further study. But it is not acceptable in
its totality.
Asked whether the French proposal was accept-
able to the United States, M r. Dulles replied:
The French proposal I regard as acce table. Of
course a great deal of detail would ave to be
worked out. But the general concept of an inter-
nationally controlled armistice seems to me to be
one that is acceptable.
Concept of Unltcd Actlon
Secretary Dulles was asked whether there
were not insuperable diﬁiculties in the creation of a
genuinely eﬁ'ective Asiatic-Paciﬁc defense alliance.
e replied:
There are certainl great difﬁculties, as I pointed
out in the speech which I made a few days ago.1
The concept of collective security in the area is
nothin new. It is in the treaties which I ne 0-
tiated in 1950 and in 1951 with Australia, ew
Zealand, and the Philippines, and also with Japan,
wherein we talked of the development of a more
comprehensive system of security in the area. The
difficulties in the way have been very great. I
wrote an article, I remember, in Foreign Affairs, I
think in January of 1952, on the problem of trying
to develop an enlarged Asian or Paciﬁc-South
Asian or Paciﬁc security pact. Now the diﬁicul-
ties are very great because of the differences be-
tween the diﬁ'erent nations, their different degrees
of inde endence or lack of independence, differ-
ences 0 race and religion, and a lack of common
traditions. It is an extremely difﬁcult area in
which to operate, and it is inevitable that progress
should be slow, and in many of these situations
the willingness to cooperate has a certain relation-
ship to the measure of fear which is entertained
by the peoples concerned. I do not say the diﬁi-
culties are 1nsu erable. If I felt that, I wouldn’t
have put my 5 oulder to the task of trying to
create it.
Asked what would be required to constitute an
effective commitment in any such agreement, Sec-
retary Dulles replied:
I believe that the commitments should be of such
a character that if they were openly challenged we
would be prepared to ﬁght, just as our similar
commitments carry that implication in relation to
the other mutual-security arrangements we have
made—the North Atlantic Treaty, the ANZUs
Treaty Philippine Treaty, the Rio Treaties, and
so forth.
Asked what would bring such an agreement into
operation, he said:
‘ BULLETIN of May 17, 1954, p. 739.
If the states of Viet-Nam, Laos, and Cambodia
are comprehended in this collective security pact,
I would feel then it would be appropriate to use
force to put down attacks such as are now going
on there.
Asked if such a pact would include the Associ-
ated States, he replied.-
That depends a good deal upon the views of
other countries and ourselves. It depends upon
the views of the Governments of Viet-Nam, Laos,
and Cambodia, on the views of the French, on the
views of some of the other articipants. I can’t
forecast that at the present time because the situa-
tion is very much in a state of ﬂux.
Asked if such a concept was designed speciﬁcally
to meet the situation in Indochina or the broader
area, he replied:
The purpose of this collective security arrange-
ment which we are trying to create is to save
Southeast Asia, to save all of Southeast Asia if
it can be saved; if not, to save essential parts of it.
Asked if the plan for collective security could
succeed if one or more of its segments were lost to
the Communists, he replied:
The situation in that area, as we found it, was
that it was subject to the so-called “domino
theor .” You mean that if one went, another
woul go? We are trying to change it so that
would not be the case. That is the whole theory
of collective security. You generally have a whole
series of countries which can be picked up one by
one. That is the whole theory of the North At-
lantic Treaty. As the nations come together, then
the “domino theory,” so-called, ceases to apply.
And what we are trying to do is create a situation
in Southeast Asia where the domino situation will
not apply.
And while I see it has been said that I felt that
Southeast Asia could be secured even without per-
haps Viet-Nam, Laos, and Cambodia, I do not want
for a minute to underestimate the importance of
those countries nor do I want for a minute to give
the impression that we believe that they are going
to be lost or that we have given up trying to pre-
vent their being lost. On the contrary, we recog-
nize that they are extremely important and that
the problem of saving Southeast Asia is far more
difﬁcult if they are lost. But I do not want to
give the impression either that if events that we
could not control and which we do not anticipate
should lead to their being lost, that we would con-
sider the whole situation hopeless, and we would
give up in despair. We do not give up in despair.
Also, we do not give up Viet-Nam, Laos, or Cam-
bodia.
