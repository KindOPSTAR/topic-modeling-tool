more and more barriers to commerce with the out-
side. A general European government was needed
to promote the common interest in a wider market
and freer trade.
Likewise, it was a parent that no European state
could defend itself) alone. Despite terrible war
damage, the Soviet Union had great and growing
military and industrial power. No single nation
had the resources in terms of money, materiel,
or men to face the Soviet threat by itself. None
would be able, merely in terms of strategy, to
defend itself against a Soviet attack.
Nor was a coalition an adequate answer. Sepa-
rate national forces, even if combined, would be
grossly inefficient and could hardly roduce a
roperly balanced total force for the efense of
urope. Effective defense, within Europe’s
means, required European institutions which could
combine its resources in the most efﬁcient wa .
Men were not lacking who saw the no for
European unity. Among them were ractical
leaders like Schuman, Pleven, and Jean onnet in
France; Adenauer in the German Federal Repub-
lic; Paul-Henri Speak of Belgium; de Gasperi of
Italy; and man others. Their experience in
gra pling with urope’s problems convinced them
f the urgent necessity for Europe to unify under
supranational institutions if its peoples were to
live and prosper together in security and peace.
The mer 'ng of the basic interests of West Ger-
many an its neighbors offered the only hope for a
constructive and permanent solution of their rela-
tions. The revival of West Germany under
leaders devoted to the European idea provided an
historic opportunity which must not be allowed to
sli away.
The problem was how to proceed. Let us look
brieﬂy at what has been done so far toward eco-
nomic, defense, and political unity.
Measures for Economic Unlty
In dealing with Europe’s postwar economic dif-
ﬁculties, organizations like OEEC [Organization
for European Economic Cooperation], EPU
[European Payments Union], and the Council of
Europe had performed useful functions. But,
while they rovided a basis for coo eration among
the states of) Euro e, they acted on y by unanimity
and could procee only as rapidly as their most
hesitant member. It was becoming clear, how-
ever, that if Europe was ever to solve her basic
economic problems, she must promptly achieve
more organic unity by creating European agen-
cies capable of acting for the common interest.
But the obstacles to such closer economic unity
were and are formidable, and deeply rooted. The
very maturity of the European economies was a
source of special difﬁculties. The long history of
tariffs and other measures to protect national mar-
kets had created entrenched vested interests cer-
tain to oppose their removal.
Moreover, the expanded economic role of the
modern state complicates the task of attempting
to establish a new federation. Today, when the
state accepts responsibility for the health of the
economy, it manages the budget, taxation, cur-
rency and credit, and regulation of imports and
exports as interrelated means for discharging this
function. If a new federal state initially assumed
this broad responsibility, it would probably be
unable to cope with it. Yet to try to disentangle
some of these threads for transfer to a federation,
while leavin the rest in the hands of the member
states, woul hardly provide a permanent work-
able solution.
Faced with this dilemma, M. Schuman, in May
1950, suggested a unique method for etting
started. In proposing the Coal and Stee Com-
munity, he stated that his lan had three major
purposes: ( 1) to promote Franco-German trust
and rap rochement by utting their primary raw
materia 5, coal and steellrunder common Euro ean
institutions; (2 to make a start toward eer
European trade y opening up a single market for
these two basic industries; (3) to establish the
nucleus of federal institutions. Six countries—
France, West German , Italy, and the Benelux
nations—joined in estaglishing the Community.
Separating out the coal and steel industries for
European control was no easy task. In many
ways they are woven into the fabric of their sepa-
rate national economies. In transferring them to
the European agencies, the Coal and Steel Treaty
inevitably left certain threads untied.
The creators of the Coal and Steel Community
were well aware that over time these loose ends
might well cause serious trouble. But they were
not planning for a static future. They did not ex-
pect the Coal and Steel Community to stand alone
indeﬁnitely. It was looked on as a ﬁrst step only.
The essential thin was to make a be 'nnin to-
ward unity before file opportunity was 0st. heir
plan and purpose was to start in motion a proc-
ess—a process of growth—which would ultimately
embody wider functions and authority.
In part this method was directed to accumulat-
ing experience and in part to creating a climate
of opinion. The Coal and Steel Communit was
intended to teach by example the beneﬁts 0 even
limited economic unity. It was also designed to
start the training and creation of a group of Euro-
pean ofﬁcials w ose lo alty was wider than na-
tional loyalty; whose horizons were wider than
national horizons. Finally, it was to provide a
symbol and a center around which new loyalties
could group themselves. It was to be the living
sign of a future Europe which would beckon others
toward European solutions for other problems.
In the span of a little more than 3 years, the
initial idea has already borne fruit to an amazing
extent. The Coal and Steel Community has now
been in operation for a year and a half as a sort
of limited federation. Its institutions are set up
