The United Nations Record of Accomplishment

Public opinion plays such a decisive and funda-
mental part in every large aﬁ'air today and the
prospects are that it will play such an increas-
ingly large part in the future, that it is an ex-
ceptional privilege for me to have this opportunity
to ap ear before you, the members of the Associ-
ated gress, who by any rational standard must be
ranked among the foremost opinion makers in
our country.
Membership in the Associated Press is a great
privilege which is ea erly sought after for the
onor and the power w ich it brings with it. But,
as you all know, it brings with it at least equivalent
responsibilities and these do tend to increase rather
than decrease as time goes on.
The osition of our country in the ﬁeld of for-
eign re ations is squarely based on public opinion
as are all other activities of our Government.
Whenever the conduct of foreign relations gets
separated from public opinion, the results are
uniformly disastrous. To the extent that the
state of public opinion is intelligent and realistic,
our foreign licies will be successful; to the ex-
tent that u lic opinion is in error, our foreign
policies Will be in error. They cannot be discon-
nected—and that, of course, is where our re-
sponsibility as newspapermen directly a ects our
foreign relations.
Today, let us examine what some basic American
attitudes are concerning foreign relations, and
then see whether we think these attitudes meet
the needs of our present situation.
As a people, we Americans like to solve prob-
lems, to overcome obstacles, and to build. It is a
national trait. We have been doing these things
ever since the foundation of our country and they
have become second nature with us. We do not
perhaps reﬂect much on the fact that all problems
cannot be solved and that all obstacles cannot be
overcome.
' Address made before the annual luncheon of the mem-
bers of the Associated Press, New York, N. Y.. on Apr. 19
(U.S./U.N. press release 1905/A dated Apr. 16).
We have developed an attitude which to some
foreigners seems to be like that of the busy execu-
tive who wants to get everything cleaned u in
time to catch the 5: 15 train. To some of tgem
Americans are like people who think of the world
as a potential tennis court in which all the tapes
are stapled down and all the edges neat.
The direct opposite of this attitude exists in
certain other parts of the world where man think
that the great roblems cannot be solve —that
they can never solved and that the best thing
for sensible men to do is to roll with the punch
duck your head when the missiles start ﬂying and
generally follow the idea of “eat, drink and be
merry for tomorrow we die.”
As between these two attitudes there is no doubt
whatever that we are more nearly right and they
are more nearly wron . Of course, roblems can
be solved. They are ing solved a the time in
one way or another. In fact some of them are
being solved in such a way that the solution creates
a lot of new and more difﬁcult problems. But one
thing is certain: the world does not stand still.
Some problems in the past have been brutally
solved by war—witness the overthrow of the cen-
tral European monarchies in World War I, the
destruction of Fascism, Nazism, and Japanese im-
perialism in World War II. To be sure, these
events witnessed the rise of communism, which in
its turn brought immense new problems. These
are chun es which show that the world does not
stand sti 1.
Another great change which all men of my age
have seen is the growth of nationalism all over
the world. It is one great world fact which in
most cases has been accom anied by ﬁghting, some
of it on a small scale and) some of it to a larger
degree.
Many changes have also come about in the world
through peaceful means. In fee the whole face
of the world was changed by t e discovery of
America which was made in rather primitive sail-
boats and has since been followed by steamships
railroads, automobiles and airplanes in the ﬁeld of
