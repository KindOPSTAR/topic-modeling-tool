ued at $1,098,701 have been shipped to three
countries of Eastern Europe, as follows:
Ball and roller bearings to Czechoslovakia
($703,230), Hungary ($172,000) , and Poland
($143,000).
Rolling Mill parts to Poland ($80,471).
Norway
Norway has shipped 3,000 metric tons of alu-
minum ingots, valued at $1,770,000, to the USSR.
under a barter agreement signed early in 1953.
Besides aluminum, the major commodities in the
agreement are Norwegian salted herring and
hardened whale fats and Russian wheat, rye,
manganese ore, and phosphate rock. On July 31,
1953, I wrote to you concerning Norway’s shi -
ments of aluminum to the Soviet bloc under its
1952 trade a reements and recommended that aid
be continue to Norway. On August 1 you so
ordered. The basic considerations involved in
that case are little changed, and need not be re-
peated in this letter.
Unlted Klnldem
The British have shipped an additional quan-
tity of their prior-commitment items. These new
shipments totaled $893,643. The bulk of them
went to Poland with about $50,000 going to
Hungary and about $4,000 to Czechoslovakia.
The principal items were locomotive equipment,
strip mill parts, copper wire, compressors, and
miscellaneous equipment. Besides these prior
commitments, $10,199 worth of embargo-type
items were shi ped from the United Kingdom in
small lots to Fliistern Europe. These small ship-
ments consisted of mineral oil to Poland and bear-
in (mainl splare arts) to Poland, Czechoslo-
vatlxsia, and t e .S.§.)R.
In this letter I have devoted more space to the
Danish tanker than to the shipments from the
other countries because of the strategic importance
and monetary value of the tanker and because it
was the second such vessel to be delivered; also be-
cause Denmark—unlike France, Norway, and the
United Kingdom—was not discussed in my letter
of July 31, 1953, which you sent to the Congress on
August 1. But the main conclusion is equall
valid in each of these cases: that it would be detri-
mental to the security of the United States to
terminate aid.
It is appropriate to include in this letter a brief
report on a strategic cargo that moved from
Turkey to Czechoslovakia, even thou h I do not
consider it a case where a government ‘knowingly
permits” a shipment within the meaning of the
Battle Act. The car 0 was 500 tons of copper,
valued at $450,000. In my judgment the facts
of this case do not make it necessary for you to
determine whether to continue aid to Turkey.
Nevertheless, the strategic value of copper is so
great that its movement to the Soviet bloc must be
a matter of concern to the Congress as well as to
the Executive Branch. Therefore I suggest that
you inform the Con ess that the shipment took
place, that high Tur (ish authorities investigated
1t. and gave us the facts concerning it, and that
Turkey has taken steps to prevent a repetition of
the incident. It will be of interest, too that
Turke has recently become a member of the in-
forma Consultative Group by means of which
ﬁfteen nations coordinate their strategic trade
controls, and the Turks have 'ven impressive
evidence of their cooperation in giis program.
Respectfully yours,

lnternatlonal Sugar Agreement
Statement by Thorsten V. K alijar'vi
Acting Assista/nt Secretary for Economic A fairs 1
As Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Eco-
nomic Aﬁ'airs I am a pearing before this Com-
mittee in support ofp the International Sugar
Agreement.2 This agreement has our support as
a practical eﬂ'ort toward eliminating the recurrin
crises which upset this worldwide industry. 1%
critical surplus situation now exists which threat-
ens the well-bein of a number of friendly coun-
tries. The worl ’s capacit to produce sugar has
far outrun the world’s ability to consume. This
agreement is necessa to remove marketing un-
certainties while facilitatin needed adjustments.
Close at home, the Unite States has important
interests—economic, political, and strategic—in
the world’s greatest sugar producing and ex ort-
ing areas in the Caribbean. The security 0 our
considerable trade and investment, our sources of
necessary raw materials, and our military bases in
that area depend upon the maintenance of a rea-
sonable degree of political stability and closely
related economic well-being. A sharp depression
of prices and mounting world sugar surpluses
would cause extreme economic distress and severe
olitical unrest in this area. In that event U.S.
interests would suffer and both international com-
munism and anti-American nationalism would
stand to gain. The United States, therefore, has
a si iﬁcant stake in any international action
whic would help to prevent this eventualitg.
