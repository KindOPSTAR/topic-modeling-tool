help housing, whereby self-help h0usin , weather-
roof, termite-proof, hurricane-proof ouses can
be built for nominal amounts through the method
of aided self-help—a program which has attracted
wide interest not on y 1n neighboring countries
but throughout the more distant parts of the
world.
It is not enough for all of us to work to improve
economic, health, and welfare conditions. We
must all work toward he] in countries achieve
those human rights we taEe for granted.
The progress made in spreadin the ideas and
ideals of freedom to the United ations has been
considerable, and one of the foremost examples
has been the Universal Declaration of Human
Ri hts which incorporates a good deal of the Bill
of Tights, and which has been incorporated in the
constitutions of many of the newly formed coun-
tries, such as Indonesia, such as in the Preamble of
the new Constitution of Japan.
Splrltuel Atllnlty Between Free Netlene
Spiritually there is a natural afﬁnity between the
free nations. It goes deep. It is the one bond that
cannot be severed. It rises above the frustrations
of surface differences. It rises above personalities
which, in free nations, are important. That is our
bond, our mutual devotion to freedom and our
respect for the individual. \Vorking together in
the United Nations that bond has become in-
creasingly strong.
Now, I think our foreign policy must concern
itself with global militar security, but military
security is not enou h. ur bases would rest on
treacherous sands i our policy were not directly
concerned with the great forces which animate
men. We must be concerned with economic and
social advancement of peo les. We must be con-
cerned with advancing reedom and opposing
tyranny. Our olicy must carry a moral weight
which derives 30m spiritual strength. We must
have peace without bankruptcy. The United Na-
tions is helping to build a foundation of peace at
the price we can pay. You are helping to promote
this foreign policy, especially with our Caribbean
neighbors, through the Central Vocational Train-
ing School which has carried on the scholarship
program, with students from the Caribbean area
and other parts of the world, providing corps of
young people trained in vocational arts so greatly
needed to improve conditions in all 0 these
countries.

May I close by reafﬁrming what your Gov-
ernor—your great leader—has said. You are ap-
proachin your multitudinous problems with
courage orn of the knowledge that you have
traveled far on a rocky road; as he further said:
“We face that future with the faith that man can
and does rise above the pettiness of social position,
racial differences, and local and personal economic
interests to work for the common 00d.”
We believe that not only Columbus would un-
derstand; we believe that all Americans to the
North and to the South of Puerto Rico, represent-
ing the two great cultures that meet and grow
friendly in Puerto Rico—trail blazers both in their
different ways—will also understand.
The necessity for developing a bond of friend-
ship based on freedom was emphasized by Presi-
dent Eisenhower in his message which I carried
to the United Nations Human Rights Commission :
“People ever where are seeking freedom—free-
dom to live, fil‘eedom from arbitrary restraint.
freedom to think and speak as they wish, freedom
to seek and ﬁnd the truth. \Ve must iress ahead
to broaden the areas of freedom. he United
States is convinced that freedom is an indispen-
sable condition to the achievement of a stable
peace.’H
