the latter to the Soviet bloc have fallen to extremely low
levels over the past several years. To a considerable
degree this has reﬂected the lack of interest on the part
of the Soviet bloc in obtaining non-strategic and con-
sumer-type goods.
It has been, and still is, U.S. policy generally to ap-
prove the export of non‘strategic goods to the U.S.S.R.
and its European satellites. except where a particular
transaction is viewed as having adverse net impact upon
the security interests of the tree world.
Secretary Weeks explained that $1,732,590
worth of nonstrategic goods were licensed to
Euro ean Soviet bloc destinations during the 12-
montii period from October 1, 1952, through Sep-
tember 30, 1953. This represented about 85 per-
cent of the total dollar value of export license
ap lications ﬁled for these destinations.
owever, U.S. exports to these countries
dropped to a new low of $220,000 in the second
quarter of 1953, compared with quarterly aver-
age exports in 1952 of $279,000, and representing
three-tenths of one percent of the 1947 quarterly
rate of $85,000,000.
Tobacco and cigarettes comprised 73 percent of
these second uarter 1953 exports. The balance
was made up argely of secondhand clothing and
other nonstrategic commodities.
Secretary Weeks further reported that in the
third quarter of 1953 a general review of the
adequacy of the current strategic export com-
modity covera e was initiated. “This effort,” he
said, “is aime at (1) restricting the commodity
coverage to those speciﬁc grades and types which
can be identiﬁed as of strategic signiﬁcance to the
bloc and which can be effectively controlled; (2)
assuring that the coverage of strategic com-
modities is adequate to meet the security needs of
the United States and other free countries,
through extensive consultations with industry,
United States government technicians, and oﬁi-
cials of other cooperating governments; and (3)
administering the security export control program
in such manner as to obtain the maximum
cooperation of friendly nations and the export
community.”
Secretary Weeks pointed out that the Commerce
Department maintains an embargo on all exports
to the China mainland and North Korea, as well
as a transportation order which bars U.S. ships
and planes from calling at or carrying goods in-
tended for Communist China.
Owing to more eifective controls exercised by
the Hong Kong Government over the ﬂow of
strategic commodities to Communist China, U.S.
export policy to Hong Kong has been liberalized.
Relaxation of consumer goods exports to Hong
Kong, begun in mid-1953, was further developed
in the third quarter by establishing the new “Gen-
eral License Hong Kong” (not requiring prior
application) for such nonstrategic consumer c0m~
modities as dairy products, grains, cotton and
wool manufactures, paper and soap and toilet
preparations.
In addition, the report explained the pro ess
of the Commerce Department in decontro ling
short-supply export controls on a wide ran of
commodities, and the institution of proce ures
designed to simplify the administration of export
controls. These have resulted in economies for
the Government and business.

operations is published under the title, “Ex ort
Control, Twenty-ﬁfth Quarterly Report.” be
