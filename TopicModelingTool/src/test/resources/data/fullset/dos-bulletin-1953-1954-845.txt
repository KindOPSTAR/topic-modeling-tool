Energy Commission, United States Na and
Army, was promptly formed and sent to vkywajar
lein—and the services of the American Red Cross
ofﬁce at Kwa'alein were enlisted—to assure any
necessary me ical attention and care for the per-
sonal well-being of all concerned. They are re-
maining under close observation and any of them
who may need it will continue to receive the best
medical attention.
I am informed that there is no medical reason
to expect any ermanent after-effects on their gen-
eral health, due to the falling of radioactive
materials.
The United States Government considers the
request and the su gestions of the petitioners both
reasonable and he ful. The restraint and mod-
eration with whic they have been presented
evokes admiration and sympathy.
Regarding the etitioners’ requests, that “all
experiments with ethal weapons within this area
be immediately ceased,” attention is called to the
United States Government’s announcement of
May 13 that “the 1954 series of tests . . . have
been completed,” and that “within a few da s sea
and air trafﬁc may be safely resumed within the
‘warning area’ which was set up for safety ur-
poses for the time when the tests were ta in
place. Oﬂicial notice to mariners and airmen wi
published.”
As the etitioners rightly imply, the United
States won (1 not have been conducting such tests
if it had not been determined after very careful
study that they were required in the interests of
general peace and security. The selection of test
sites in this particular area was made only after
very careful examination of the alternative pos-
sibilities, and in an effort to insure that the tests
were carried out with least possible danger. It
will be recalled that, pursuant to the rovisions
of the trusteeship agreement which deSignate the
trust territory as a strategic area, the United States
notiﬁed the United Nations on April 2, 1953, that
the area of the Paciﬁc proving grounds was being
closed for security reasons in order to conduct
necessary atomic experiments.
Let me also assure all the inhabitants of the
Paciﬁc trust territory, and the members of the
United Nations, that the United States authorities
are doing everything possible to prevent any re-
currence of possible danger. The United States
Government is taking and will continue to take
“all possible precautionary measures . . . be-
fore such weapons are exploded,” as suggested by
the Marshallese citizens. We also agree that “all
people in the area be instructed in safety meas-
ures” and that instructions be given to Marshallese
medical practitioners and health aides which will
be useful in detecting danger and avoiding harm.
Further, it is reasonable and right, as the peti-
tioners suggest, that any Marshallese citizens who
are removed as a result of test activities, will be
reestablished in their original habitat in such a
way that no ﬁnancial loss would be involved.
The United States Government, and the oﬂicials
immediately concerned with the administration of
the territory, greatly appreciate the words of com-
mendation of the petitioners with respect to the
wa the territory lS bein administered.
he welfare of the in abitants has been the
constant concern of the United States Govern-
ments, and particularly of the Hi h Commissioner,
who will continue to spare no e ort necessary to
give effect to the Trusteeship Agreement.
TEXT OF MARSHALLESE PETITION
U.N. doc. T/PET.10/28
Dated May 6, 1954
Ann. 20m, 1954
To: The United Nations
From: The Marshallese people
Subject: Complaint regarding the explosion of lethal
weapons within our home islands
The following should not be misconstrued as a repudia-
tion of the United States as our governing agency for the
United Nations under the trusteeship agreement, for aside
from the complaint registered in this petition we have
found the American administration by far the most agree
able one in our memory. But in view of the increasing
danger from the experiments with deadly explosives
thousands of times more powerful than anything pre—
viously known to men, the lethal eifects of which have
already touched the inhabitants of two oi! the atolls in
the Marshalls, namely. Rongelab and Uterik, who are now
suffering in various degrees from “lowering of blood
count,” burns, nausea and the falling oiI of hair from
the head, and whose complete recovery no one can promise
with any certainty, we, the Marshallese people feel that
we must follow the dictates of our consciences to bring
forth this urgent plea to the United Nations, which has
pledged itself to safeguard the life, liberty and the gem
eral well being of the people of the Trust Territory, of
which the Marshallese people are a part.
The Marhallese people are not only fearful of the dan-
ger to their persons from these deadly weapons in case
of another miscalculation, but they are also very concerned
for the increasing number of people who are being re-
moved from their land.
Land means a great deal to the Marshallese. It means
more than just a place where you can plant your food
crops and build your houses; or a place where you can
bury your dead. It is the very life of the people. Take
away their land and their spirits go also.
The Marshall Islands are all low coral atolls with land
area where food plants can be cultivated quite limited,
even for today's population of about eleven-thousand
people. But the population is growing rapidly; the time
when this number will be doubled is not far off.
The Japanese had taken away the best portions of the
following atolls; Jaluit, Kwajalein. Enewetak, Mille,
Maloelap and Wotje to be fortiﬁed as part of their prepa-
ration for the last war, World War II. So far, only Imedj
Island on Jaluit Atoll has been returned to its former
owners.
For security reasons, Kwajalein Island is being kept
for the military use. Bikini and Eniwetak were taken
away for Atomic bomb tests and their inhabitants were
moved to Kili Island and Ujelang Atoll respectively. Be
cause Rongelab and Uterik are now radio-active, their
inhabitants are being kept on Kwajalein for an indeter-
minate length of time. “Where next?" is the big question
which looms large in all of our minds.
Therefore, we the members of the Marshallese Congress
