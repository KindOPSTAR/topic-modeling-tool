Understanding Inter-American Economic Problems
6 Merw-in L. Bolian
.8. Representative on the Inter-American Economic and Social Council1
In two days, on May 22, we will be celebrating
National Maritime Day. This day has been set
aside by our Nation to ay honor to the American
Merchant Marine. s President Eisenhower
stated in his proclamation of Maritime Day:2
The American Merchant Marine has continued to aid
in developing peaceful commercial relations with the na-
tions of the free world; and through the prompt delivery
of supplies and equipment to our armed forces overseas
. . . has effectively helped to strengthen the forces of
freedom throughout the world.
Because of the nearness of Maritime Day and
because shippin is one of our country’s oldest
industries, as we 1 as a vital factor in our national
security, I would like to talk a little about the
maritime policy of the United States and particu-
larl its application to Latin America.
The maritime policy of the United States is
clearly enunciated in the Merchant Marine Act
of 1936. If we eliminate all the legal phraseology
which is an essential—if sometimes confusing—
part of all le islation, our maritime policy con-
sists of the following basic points:
One, we believe it is essential for both the na-
tional defense and the development of our for-
eign and domestic commerce that we have a mer-
chant marine which is capable of carrying our
domestic water-borne commerce.
Two, we believe it is essential, for the same rea-
sons, that we have a merchant marine which is
capable of carrying a substantial ortion of our
wager-borne export and import foreign commerce;
an
Three, we believe it is essential that we have a
merchant marine which is capable of swiftly and
elfectively serving as a naval and military auxil-
iary in time of war or national emergency.

That is our olicy. It is simple strai htfor-
ward and close y linked to the national efense
and economic development needs of our country.
The carrying out of this policy is the res onsi-
bilit of several overnment agencies inc uding
the e artment of State. We in the Department
are ful and constantly aware of this responsibil-
ity. \_ e are also very much aware of the ditii-
' culties which are confronting U.S. shi ping today
and of the need for vigorous and intel igent action
if we are to maintain the competitive position of
United States vessels in foreign trade.
U.S. shipping in Latin America today faces a
multitude of problems which are diverse and
highly complex in nature. However, I do not
think it is an unwarranted oversimpliﬁcation to
state that these problems result, in the main, from
two basic factors. One is the desire of man of
the other American Republics to develop an ex-
pand merchant shipping as an as ct of their
national policy. The other, and this IS particularl
pertinent in Latin America, is the shortage of do -
ars and the desire to conserve those dollars which
are available.
The development of maritime ro rams by
Latin American nations since Worl \ ar II has
been at an accelerated pace. Impetus for such
develo ment resulted from many factors—in some
cases rom ,the fact that durin the war we were
forced to divert vitally necde cargo ships from
the Latin American trade to carry our troops and
supplies to the combat areas and, as a result. some
di culty was experienced in meeting the total
shipping requirements of the other American Re-
publics. In other cases maritime programs were
a logical and predictable out owth of the eco-
nomic progress of the area. n still other cases
the desire to conserve foreign exchange was a
motivating factor.
Whatever the reasons for the develo ment of
shipping programs, the facts are that t ose pro-
grams were pursued vigorously from the time of
their inception, and today several Latin American
countries are ﬁrmly established in international
