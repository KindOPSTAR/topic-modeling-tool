was equal to more than one-fourth of all Ameri-
can exports. The fact that after so large a pro-
gram of assistance, carried out over so long a.
period, the rest of the world still ﬁnds it necessary
to maintain drastic restrictions on trade and pay-
ment, directed particularly against this country,
indicates strikingly the gravity of the world’s
dollar problem.
The average world dollar deﬁcit of $4 billion a
year covers up large and signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations
as well as a declining trend. In 1947, before the
Marshall lan began, the deﬁcit reached a peak
of $ll billion which was reduced Db? almost one-
half in the first 2 years of the arshall plan.
The. ﬁrst impact of the Korean war was eatly
to reduce the deﬁcit, to somewhat more t an $1
billion in 1950, owing largely to our heavy buying
of raw materials and other goods and services
from abroad. But in 1951 the pendulum swung
the other way, as the European countries felt the
impact of the previous great rise of raw material
prices as compared with the pre-Korean level,
while the raw materials exporting countries, once
the buying rush had subsided, felt the effects of
the shrinkage in the volume and value of their
exports. In the past two years there has again
been a marked im rovement. For the ﬁrst time
since the war our oreign trade, exclusive of mil-
itary exports. has come into balance; and foreign
gold and dollar reserves have increased at a rate
that is currently running at well over $2 billion
per year.
Of major importance for this report is the inter-
pretation of this current improvement. There is
a disposition in some quarters to conclude that
the world’s dollar problem has at length been
solved. This conclusion gains plausibility from
the fact that, with some important exceptions,
the lVestern European countries have been making
substantial economic progress. Their industrial
production is now much above prewar; forei
trade both within \Vestern Europe and with t e
outside world, is also much above prewar; the
internal ﬁnancial situation in most of the coun-
tries has much improved and inﬂation has been
checked; direct internal controls have been re-
moved or relaxed and, again with some exceptions,
general monetary and ﬁscal controls have been
more effectivelfy a plied. Finally, through the
Organization or uropean Economic Coopera-
tion, signiﬁcant headway has been made toward
liberalizing trade and widening the area of multi-
lateral trade and payment, both within Western
Europe and with its overseas trading areas.
This is an impressive record, and this Commis-
sion feels conﬁdence in its conclusion that genuine
progress has been made toward establishing the
conditions in which multilateral trade and pay-
ment may be made worldwide, and the dollar def-
icit removed. not primarily through trade and
payment restrictions but in a relatively free mar-
ket. But it is the Commission’s view that much
yet remains to be accomplished before a depend-
able and durable solution of the dollar problem
can be achieved.
In interpreting the current im rovement, ac-
count must be taken of a number oFfacts. It has
been accompanied by a favorable change for
Western Europe in the “terms of trade”—a decline
of import prices relative to export prices—due
largel to the decline of raw materials prices from
the hlgh level created by the outbreak of the
Korean war. Europe’s terms of trade have
worsened since before World War II owing,
basically, to the large growth of world industrial
output smce prewar and to the relatively small
growth of production of raw materials and food,
due in part to the urge of the primary producing
countries to industrialize and diversify their
economies. Looking to the future, there will be
a major problem of developin the raw materials
needed by the continuing industrial expansion;
and though in the end this may prove one of the
main ways of achieving a solution of the problem
of world trade imbalance, it suggests also that for
a long time to come the terms of trade may con-
tinue to be one of the chief problems. Here,
clearly, is an area of international policy which
should command our most serious attention.
Other uncertainties arise from the fact that,
owing to the direct restriction abroad of dollar
imports, the potential demand for dollar goods
and services, in a free market and with convertible
currencies, could substantially exceed the present
restricted demand. There is the further fact that
the recent high level of American imports, rela-
tive to earlier years, has been closely linked with
the high level of our gross national product. Ex-
perience has shown that our imports are very
sensitive to our level of national income, and that
any contraction here has a multiplied eﬂect in
reducing foreign exports to this country.
There is, furthermore, an element of illusion
in the present apparent balanced position of our
trade (apart from military ex orts), in that large
“extraordinary” dollar expen itures are still being
made by the United States in other countries. As
of the end of 1953 these were running at an annual
rate of about $3 billion. These extraordina
expenditures consist of disbursements by our mili-
tary and civilian establishments abroad, oﬂ'shore
procurement, and stockpiling. If economic aid
18 also included, the total of extraordinary ex-
penditures, as of the end of 1953, was running at
about the rate of $5 billion r year. Against this
total should be credited t e current increase of
foreign gold and dollar reserves which is running
at a rate of over $2 billion per year. There is thus
a concealed dollar gap of some $2 billion to $3
billion annually, which would be increased if there
were a change in the economic situation, such as a
recession here or a deterioration in Western
Europe's terms of trade. On the other hand, it
should be recognized that major parts of our “ex-
