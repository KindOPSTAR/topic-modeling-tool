butions to the operational fund. The United
States representative stressed throughout the dis-
cussions that both the volume of movements and
the contributions to the operational expenditure
by other overnments had been disap ointing to
the Unite States Government. He al)so pointed
out that failure on the part of the Committee
to raise the additional $4,652,299 in the early part
of 1954 could easily result in the termination of
the Committee’s activities, because the Committee
has not yet succeeded in building up a workin
capital fund which is needed to maintain a soun
cash position at all times.
There was some evidence in the responses of
other governments that the need for lar er con-
tributions to the operational fund was un erstood
and would be considered by the overnments in
determining their contributions or 1954. Aus-
tralia pledged $134,400 at the session in addition
to the payments in reimbursement of transport
to Australia. The United States representative
advised the Committee that the United States Con-
gyress had appropriated $7,500,000 to cover the
nited States contribution to the Committee for
1954. The discussions on the budget and plan of
expenditure for 1954 which took place in the meet-
ings of the Subcommittee on Finance were re-
peated later in the full Committee.
The rocedures and operations of the revolvin
fund a ministered by the voluntary agencies with
ﬁnancial assistance from the Migration Committee
were reviewed in connection with the adoption of
the plan of ex enditure. Repayments by migrants
for the cost 0 transport originall advanced from
the revolving fund were reported, to average 28.5
percent of the money expended by the agencies in
1952. One agency recorded repayments as high
as 55 percent. The United States representative
expressed concern as to the adequacy of the ac-
counting rocedures with respect to advances made
to the vo untary agencies by the Migration Com-
mittee, and the Director was instructed to secure
appropriate audits from the voluntary agencies,
not only of the funds involved but of the number
of migrants moved with the assistance of the Com-
mittee’s funds.
Australian lmmlgrant Quota Ralaed
The Migration Committee in considering the
plan of operations for 1954 learned that Australia
ad raised her overall quota of immigrants
for the ﬁscal year 1953—1954 and expected that as
many as 20,000 would move to Australia under the
auspices of the Committee during 1954. At the
insistence of the Canadian representative, the esti-
mate for Canada was set down at 15,000 on the
assumption that there will be more commercial
shipping on North Atlantic routes during 1954.
Canada expects to admit the same total of immi-
grants in 1954 as in 1953. It was estimated that
about 30,000 refugees who would receive visas un-
der the Refugee Relief Act would move to the
United States under the Committee’s auspices.’
An estimate of 25,000 migrants to the Ar entine
was based on the number of relatives in Ita y who
have already been called forward by Italian im-
migrants resident in the Argentine. Estimates of
movement to Brazil in 1954 were set down at 15,-
000; Chile, 3,000; Venezuela, 5,200; and all other
countries, 4,400.
The Director reported that the services provided
by the Committee for the purpose of increasing
the volume of movement would be continued in
1954. A number of special projects such as train-
in in Brazilian methods for Italian building
lagorers ranted visas for Brazil, lan uage in-
struction or Greek migrants booked for ustralia,
and a study to im rove preselection procedures in
Italy were alrea y in rogress and had demon-
strated their value. he Committee will also
assist the Italian Government in 1954 to improve
its preembarkation procedures in order to increase
the number of relatives departing to join immi-
rants already in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and
enezuela. Assistance to the Brazilian Govern-
ment in developin placement procedures will also
be continued. Tie 1L0, UNESCO, and W110 are
collaborating in the planning and conduct of these
special services.
Flnal Draft of Conatltutlon Approved
After preliminary discussion in the full Com-
mittee on the proposed Draft Constitution durin
which the observations of the representatives 0
the United Nations and the specialized agencies
were presented, a Subcommittee on the Constitu-
tion composed of representatives of the Argentine
Denmark, France, Canada, German , Ital , an
the United States was a pointed. udge Chaun-
cey W. Reed, alternate nited States representa-
tive, served as chairman. The main concern of
the United Nations and the specialized agencies
was that there be the maximum collaboration be—
tween the Committee and the specialized agencies
and that overlapping of services be avoided. This
was reﬂected in re uests that provision be made in
the Constitution t at the specialized agencies be
invited to attend meetings of the Executive Com-
mittee as observers.
The Subcommittee and later the full Committee
felt that this arrangement would not be necessary
to achieve these objectives in view of the fact that
the Executive Committee under the Constitution
will not be a policymaking body; its chief function
will be to prepare the work of the Council, which
alone has the power to make policy decisions. The
Draft Constitution before the Committee already
provided for the participation of the specialized
agencies in the sessions of the Council as observers.
