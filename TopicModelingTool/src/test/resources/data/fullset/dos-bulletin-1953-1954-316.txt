stressing Arab hostilit toward Israel, emphasiz-
ing the constant ro lem of Arab inﬁltration
across the Jordan- srael armistice line, and detail-
ing the loss of life and property as a result thereof,
from the Israel point of view. While regretting
the loss of life at Qibiya, he was “astonished at
our eople’s general record of atience under un-
ara leled tension,” and deniedp that Israel armed
orces had been involved. Mr. Eban believed that
the Security Council should devote its attention to
what be deemed the basic causes of the problem
and should attempt to bring about peace.“ Am-
bassador Charles Malik, of Lebanon, who fol-
lowed, contested the entire Israel point of view,
declared that it was not at all su ported by the
Bennike report, and urged the Council to take
strong action to prevent a repetition of such inci-
dents.” Dr. Yusuf Haikal, the re resentative of
Jordan, adopted a similar tone on ovember 16.“
On November 18 the United States, the United
Kingdom, and France circulated a draft resolution
with regard to the Qibiya incident,“ which re-
called previous resolutions of the Security Council
of July 15, 1948, August 11, 1949, and May 18,
1951, and found that the “retaliatory action at
Qibi a taken by armed forces of Israel on 14—15
Octo r 1953 and all such actions” constituted a
violation of the cease-ﬁre provisions of the Secu-
rity Council resolution of July 15, 1948, and were
“inconsistent with the Parties’ obligations under
the General Armistice Agreement and the Char-
ter.” The draft resolution also expressed “the
strongest censure” of the Israel action, which
could “only prejudice the chances of that peaceful
settlement which both Parties” were “bound to
seek,” and called upon Israel “to take effective
measures to prevent all such actions in the future.”
Note was also taken of the problem of inﬁltration
into Israel from Jordan, and the latter was re-
quested “to continue and strengthen the measures”
already being taken to prevent “such crossings.”
Moreover, the draft recalled the obligations of
Israel and Jordan, under the resolutions of the
Security Council and the General Armistice
Agreement, to prevent acts of violence. Em-
phasis was placed on their obligation to cooperate
fully with the Chief of Staff of the Truce Super-
vision Organization, who was requested to con-
sider the best ways of strengthening the Organiza-
tion and to report, within 3 months, with appro-
priate recommendations “on compliance with and
enforcement of the General Armistice Agree-
ments with particular reference to the provisions
of this resolution.”
There was considerable criticism of the resolu-
tion after its presentation on November 20 by the
sponsoring powers." The Arabs were critical,
largely because the resolution contained no speciﬁc
provision for compensation or for punishment of
the perpetrators. Sir Zafrulla Khan of Pakistan
had no doubt that Israel had been guilty of rave
violations, and he felt it the duty of both srael
and Jordan to live up to their obligations under
the armistice agreements.
Ambassador Eban on November 24 expressed
grave misgivings concerning the draft resolution,“
charging the authors thereof with unfairness to
Israel, repeating the Israel thesis as to the inac-
curacy of the Bennike report on the Qibiya inci-
dent, and regretting the alleged abandonment of
the “invariable policy" of the Security Council of
calling upon the Governments concerned “to nego-
tiate a ﬁnal settlement of all questions outstanding
between them.” Mr. Eban noted that, on N ovem-
ber 23, he had invoked article XII of the Israel-
Jordan Armistice Agreement and asked Secretary-
General Dag Hammarskjold to call a meeting of
Israel and Jordan representatives at the United
Nations for direct and immediate negotiations to
prevent a further impairment of peace and security
in the Near East. Ambassador Eban‘s remarks
“produced a painful impression” on M. Hoppenot,
of France, because they cast a retlection on the
motives of the sponsors of the resolution.
However, partially to meet the Israel position,
the resolution was modiﬁed by the addition of a
ﬁnal paragraph; in this form it was approved on
November 24 by a vote of 9—0-2 (Lebanon,
U. S. S. R.). The new paragraph requested the
Chief of Staff to report to the Security Council
within 3 months with appropriate recommenda-
tions as to compliance with an enforcement of the
General Armistice Agreements, taking into ac-
count any agreement reached in pursuance of the
Israel request under article XII of the Israel-
Jordan Armistice Agreement.“ Notwithstanding
his views on the resolution as a whole, Ambassa-
dor Eban expressed his pleasure at this addition
when he spoke on November 25.
Ambassador Malik of Lebanon, who spoke in
explanation of his abstention, gave his own analy-
sis of the problem and, among other things, indi-
cated that from the Arab point of view, there
could be peace negotiations if (1) Israel respected
the Armistice Agreements; (2) the resolutions of
the United Nations with respect to Palestine were
implemented; and (3) the Arabs were so strength-
