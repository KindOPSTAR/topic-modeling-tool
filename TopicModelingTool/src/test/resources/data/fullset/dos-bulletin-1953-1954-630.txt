Americans Ahmad
by Francis J. Uolligan
“The heart of American foreign policy is our
national conduct,” Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles has said, “and that is a matter not just for
our diplomats but for every indiV1dual among us.”
These words are articularly apphcable to those
who travel abroa . .
They conﬁrm, among other things, what the
Pres1dent said last fall when speaking at New
Orleans.1 On that occaSion, he remarked,
I think that almost any American traveling abroad these
days experiences occasionally a sense of shock when he
recalls an opinion about Americans in general held abroad
that seems to that American visitor to be so far from
the truth. He ﬁnds Americans considered immature dip-
lomatically; impulsive, too proud of their strength, ready
to tight, wanting war. He is shocked. . These
friendships of which I speak, my friends, are so vital to
us that no American. no matter how exalted or how lowly
may be his station, can afford to ignore them. Each of
us. whether bearing a commission from his Government
or traveling by himself for pleasure or for business. is a
representative of the United States of America and he
must try to portray America as he believes it in his heart
to be: a peace-loving nation living in the fear of God but
in the fear of God only, and trying to be partners with
our friends. And we accept for a friend anyone who
genuinely holds out the hand of friendship to us as we do
to them.
These views are, in effect, documented by two
recent studies made by the International Educa-
tional Exchange Servme of the Department of
State. One study involved asking more than 200
Americans who had studied in Great Britain for
their comments on Anglo-American relations as
they had observed them. In listing the major
causes of misunderstanding of America by the
British, 80 mentioned “the tendency to generalize
from the observation of tourists and cer-
tain other Americans.” To describe such trav-
elers, the students used such phrases as “ncisy and
r a t h e r naive,” “ill-mannered and drunk,”
“thoughtless and ostentatious,” especially in
spending money, and “depressmgly ignorant in
t ieir disregard of local customs and modes of
behavmr.” On the other hand, most were im-
pressed by the spirit of personal friendliness
which prevailed between Americans and British-

ers, and several stated that “the British like
Americans but not America.”
The second study was based upon a question put
last year to more than 1,000 foreign students in
the United States. They were asked where they
0t their advance information about this country.
‘ighteen percent mentioned American visitors as
a major source of information. Many others cer-
tainly pick up various notions about America
from the attitude or behavior of our travelers as
they see them.
These studies and others like them indicate that
international travel is, potentially at least, the
most effective mode of contact between peo les
It not only provides badly needed dollars to do lar-
short countries (in some, tourism is the best dollar-
earner) ; it can also contribute substantially to a
truthful, factual balanced picture of the United
States in the minds of the co les of other coun-
tries. This is especially Signiﬁcant today when
public opinion can be such a vital force in inter-
national relations and when Americans are seen
abroad largely as travelers and especially as
tourists.
American travelers to foreign lands have been
few in number, at least in comparison with Euro-
peans. The distance of the outsize island which is
the United States from most other countries and
the consequent amount of time and money re-
quired for travel have limited the number and
types of travelers, the duration and extent of their
trips, and the nature and scope of their activities.
Most trips take place durin the summer months
and most are relatively brie . The lar e propor-
tion of those in educational pursuits w 0 under-
take international travel—more than 50,000 in
1952—is due, partly at least, to the fact that such
people have free time during the summer.
The worker, the merchant, or the businessman,
despite the fact that his resources may be at least
equal to those of his foreign counterpart, still has
little time for travel even when it is directly con-
nected with his business. It is probable that very
man American travelers ay only one visit to a
foreign country not immediately adjacent to the
United States. American travelers have been a
