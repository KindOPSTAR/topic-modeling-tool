Developments in Trust Territories
in Africa
Statements by Mason Sears
U.S. Representative in the Trusteeship Ommcil‘
PROGRESS IN THE OAMEROONS
U.S./U.N. press release dated February 10
In discussing the territory of the French Cam-
eroons, the main int we would like to em-
hasize——and we think it is the overriding issue—
is the rapid political and economic progress which
is taking place throughout the highly populated
areas of West Africa.
It has become a classic example of what can be
done where there is a will to cooperate between
peoples of greatl diﬂ'ering languages and back-
unds, and wil contribute enormously to the
al settlement of the colonial issue.
But the nature of this progress is such that
we cannot blind ourselves to the complications
which could arise if self- overnment was being
achieved b some peoples 0 West Africa while not
yet bein lly attained by others.
We be ieve that, if such a situation is allowed to
drift and becomes unduly prolonged, it will create
many difﬁculties and will ultimately rovide fer-
tile territory for alien-controlled agitators, dis-
guised as local patriots, to introduce Communist
activity which oﬂicially aims to take over every
nationalist movement it can reach.
To put it another way, it is our judgment that
the expected early emergence of nationhood for
the Gold Coast and Nigeria, including ﬁnal self-
determination for the British Trust areas of Togo-
land and the Cameroons, will have a very far-
reaching effect upon adjoining territories.
This means that, as time goes on, French judg-
ment with respect to the rate of progress best
suited to the welfare of their part of the Cam-
eroons is destined to become of greater and greater

importance, not only in the trust territory but
throughout Africa.
It is our 0 inion that it will have a profound
effect 11 on t e ability of colonial administrators
everyw ere to harness orderly evolution to the
constantly accelerating forces of African na-
tionalism.
However, after listening to the discussion of the
last few days, we are satisﬁed that the efﬁcient,
well-informed administrators in the French
Cameroons are fully aware of the implications of
forthcoming developments in neighboring terri-
tories. We are conﬁdent that they are prepared
to make sound decisions which will recognize the
political realities of the times and that they will
not permit the rogress of the people in their trust
territories to iﬁ'er importantly from adjoining
areas.
In conclusion, we must congratulate the French
administration for the many ﬁne contributions
which they are making to progress in the
Cameroons.
We are happy to believe that the Cameroons,
in their turn, will become self- overning at an
early date and that they, too, W1 1 use their self-
governing powers to advance the cause of freedom
in this important part of the world.
