never been a time when the future security and
welfare of our country were more dependent upon
the exercise of wise leadership in the realm of
world affairs. My recommendation for funds for
the Department of State will enable it to meet
this challenge.
Some countries are still facing such economic
conditions that they are not able solely by their
own efforts to su port the desired military eﬂ'ort
or to provide for t e economic growth and rogress
essential to our mutual obj ectives. It is t us still
necessary that supplementar goods, services, and
technical skills be provided y the United States.
It is for these purposes that funds for economic
and technical development are requested for ﬁscal
year 1955.
Through our information and exehange pro-
gram we are attempting to achieve a clear under-
standin by others of our aims, objectives, and
way of 11fe and a better understanding b us of the
aspirations and cultures of other countries. Such
mutual understanding increases our ability to exer-
cise strong, sympathetic, and cooperative leader-
ship in the mutual efforts of free peoples to achieve
their common goals.

Durin the past ear progress has been made
toward t e accomplishment of the objectives of
our international programs. Not only have our
allies and friends rown in military strength, but
also a continued igh level of production and
increased gold and dollar reserves have permitted
European countries to become more nearly self-
supporting. This improvement makes it possible
for estimates of expenditures for economic and
technical pro ams 1ncluded in this budget to be
si iﬁcantly ower than the already reduced level
0 the ﬁscal year 1954. Signiﬁcant contributory
factors in this progress have been our assistance
in past years and the positive and constructive
ﬁscal and other economic measures which have
been taken b the other countries themselves. As
a result the seal year 1955 represents, in a sense,
a eriod of transition from heavy dependence by
a arge number of countries upon masswe bilateral
economic assistance from the United States to the
use of such assistance in more limited circum-
stances. Progress in such a transition will gen-
erally depend upon the extent to which our own
policies, and those of our friends, contribute to
\increased private investment, increased exports
