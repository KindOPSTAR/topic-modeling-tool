not be in Europe separate armies of France and
Germany, but that in Europe the military forces
of both countries would be merged with that of
other forces into a European force, not subject to
national direction and not usable to serve national
ambitions.
After extended negotiation, a treaty to create
the European Defense Community was signed a
little over 2 years ago. lVithin the last ear, the
process of ratiﬁcation has been com lete by four
of the six signato nations. The nited King-
dom and the Unite States have ratiﬁed the inter-
dependent treaties with lVest Germany and have
formally pledged close political and military as-
sociation with the Eve. However, ratiﬁcation by
France and Italy is still in suspense. In both of
these countries the opponents of EM), fearing the
results of a vote, have pursued delaying tactics.
Meanwhile, tension is reappearing between coun~
tries of continental Europe, and there is danger
that the old forces of divisive hatred will again
gain control and recreate the conditions which
have, in the past, bred war. The time for unity
is fast running out.
The United States has in recent years made a
tremendous investment in Western Euro e.
In 1917, when it seemed that Europe might fall
under the militaristic rule of the German Kaiser,
we joined the battle and, through a great outpour-
ing of manpower and economic resources, helped
to turn back the despotic threat.
Again in 1940, when much of Europe had been
overrun by the armies of Nazi Germany, the
United States threw its weight into the scales and
went on to play a major part in rolling back that
new threat of despotism.
During the postwar period we underwrote a
gigantic economic and military pro am in aid of
Europe, re resented by the Marsha plan and the
buildup o the North Atlantic Treaty Organi-
zation.
These three efforts, within a single generation,
have cost us much. There is scarcely a village in
the United States that does not display a roll
of honor listing the names of their young men who
died ﬁghtin in defense of Western civilization.
Our nationa debt has grown from about $3 bil-
lion in 1917 to about $260 billion at the resent
time. The greater part of that represents t e eco-
nomic cost of the three efforts I have described.
United States policy with respect to Europe is
based on a strong and viable Europe which in-
creases the security of the United States and the
fremainder of the free world. However, it is
fundamental that Europe itself must furnish the
preponderant strength to insure its own security.
This, we believe, is only possible if the resources
of the individual nations of Western Europe are
joined together. In other words, Europe must
make the best collective use of its individual capa-
bilities if it is to attain real strength. The addi-
tional resources which the United States can devote
938
to building this strength will be meaningless if
they are not combined with the resources of a
Western Europe which is or anized on the prin-
ciple of unity. If Western urope is to remain
divided and hence perpetually weak, then there
may have to be a basic shift in United States policy.
I hope and believe that this necessity will be spared
us. But it would be foolish not to recognize the
gravity of the issues which new test the North
Atlantic Organization.
THE AMERICAS
In the Americas also, a testing is in process.
This hemisphere has been relatively free from
strife because there has been respect for the princi-
ples which, 130 years ago, were laid down by
President Monroe and the great leaders in other
American States. There were two basic princi-
ples, the ﬁrst being that the American States
would not tolerate an expansion in this hemisphere
of the colonial domains of the European powers.
The second was that they would not tolerate the
extension to this hemisphere of the political sys-
tem of any despotic European power.
These principles have been embodied in various
multilateral treaties and declarations of the Amer-
ican States.
At the Tenth Inter-American Conference, held
at Caracas, Venezuela, last March, it became the
unpleasant dut of the American States to declare
that if international communism gained control of
the political institutions of any American State,
that would threaten all the American States and
endanger the eace.
Only one of) the American States voted against
that resolution. That was Guatemala. Subse-
quently, the Communists shipped to Guatemala,
from behind the Iron Curtain, a large amount of
munitions of war. This was done surreptitiously
through the use of false manifests and false clear-
ances.
It is obvious that the alien intervention which
led to the Declaration of Caracas, has become
more pronounced and the subserviency of one of
the American States to alien despotism has been
increased.
Efforts are being made to obscure this very seri-
ous problem. It is alleged that the real concern
of the United States in Guatemala is not interna-
tional communism but the protection of United
States investments. Several months ago this Gov-
ernment suggested that the dispute between the
Guatemalan Government and the United Fruit
Company be submitted to an international court
of arbitration. We hope that that suggestion will
be accepted by the Guatemalan Government.
However, let me emphasize this. If the problem
of United States investors in Guatemala were to
be solved tomorrow to the entire satisfaction of
all parties, the attitude of the United States Gov-
Department of State Bulletin
