ably safeguard our \Vestern civilization and all
that it means in terms of human dignity and
human welfare.
Of course, if Enc fails, we shall do something.
But what we then do may be quite different from
what we had hoped would be possible. It may
involve our tactically picking our way through a
maze of manifold perils, as of old.
I have conﬁdence that the United States is
strong enough, resourceful enough, and wise
enough to reserve its vital interests even in the
face of a ailure of the E00 and the European
unity it symbolizes.
We need not, however, end upon any somber
note. I do not believe that there will be failure
to achieve European unity. My belief derives
from the fact that the oples of Europe do in
fact ossess ualities Wiich make it imperative
that urope s iould be saved.
Europe is important for many reasons. It is
strateggcally located and it has industrial power.
But a ve all, Europe is important because of its
people. They possess to a unique degree the quali-
ties which ennoble a civilization which bears the
deep imprint of Christianity. That is a fact
which it IS. I think, a propriate to mention as we
ap roach Christmas ay.
Vhat are those qualities? In individuals they
are minds trained to reason clearly and serenely,
vision to see far and truly, hearts which compre-
hend the Fathership of God and the fellowship of
man, and, ﬁnally. capacity to act rather than to be
merely contemplative.
In government, the quality we res ect is willing-
nes to trust, in great matters, to the response of
individuals possessed of the qualities I mention.
I have hopes in the response to be made regard-
ing European unity, because I have faith in our
civilization and in its human products. Delays
and difﬁculties so far encountered are above all due
to the fact that the issues have been obscured, so
that the eople do not see and think and compre-
hend an act.
That murky period is coming to an end. As the
day of decismn irrevocably a proaches, so does
comprehension grow. There ore we can have
hi h hopes.
have dealt in my talk with NATO because a
report on that organization is due the American
people. But also we can ﬁnd elsewhere good
ground for hope.
Our society of freedom has gained a clear moral
initiative over the forces of reaction.
After years of futile and evasive debate on the
part of the Soviet Union about atomic weapons,
it has at least indicated a willingness to talk
conﬁdentially, and we hope seriously, about this
problem.
After months of attempted evasion, the Soviet
Union ﬁnally, it seems, will meet and talk, again
we hope seriously, about the uniﬁcation of Ger-
many and the liberation of Austria. We have
not yet had an formal reply to our invitation
to meet at Ber in on January 4, but the Soviet
statement received yesterday speaks of “the forth-
coming conference in Berlin.’
The comin year will be a year for great deci-
sion. There lie ahead European unity, a possible
recession of the horror of atomic warfare, and a
beginning of an ending of the unnatural division
of Europe.
In Korea we look forward to the ﬁrst year of
peace since 1949.
The problems are many and grievous, but our
hopes are high. We can, therefore, in all hon-
esty look forward to the happier New Year, which
I wish you all.
Presldent’s Views
on NATO Report
White House press release dated December 28
At today’s meeting of the National Security
Council, the President received with satisfaction
the report on NATO made by Mr. Dulles, Mr. Hum-
phrey, Mr. Wilson and Mr. Stassen, who attended
the Ministerial Council Meeting at Paris. They
reported that N no is functioning eﬂicientl , and
is continuing to develop the strength and co esion
needed to provide security on a long-term collec-
tive basis.
The President was informed concerning the
ﬁospects of bringing into being the Euro an
fense Community, a matter which has long 11
of deep concern to him. He considers this the
only practical proposal for ending permanently
the recurrent strife between France and Germany,
provoked twice in our own generation by German
militarism and of creating a solid core at the cen-
ter of the haro structure. The President shares
the view which had been expressed to the Council
by Secretary Dulles, that failure soon to consum-
mate the Eoc would confront the United States
with the necessity of reappraising its basic policies
as regards Europe.
The President also was informed of the opera-
tions of the Euro an Coal and Steel Community
which has alrea y brought together, in limited
unity, the six nations which are prospective mem-
bers of the European Defense and Political Com-
munities. He was encouraged that the Coal and
Steel Community is now in etfective operation and
reafﬁrms his hope that ways might be found to
enable the United States to assist, on a loan basis,
in modernizing and developing the natural re-
sources within the jurisdiction of this Commu-
nity, in accordance with his letter of June 15 to
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the
House Foreign Affairs Committee.1
