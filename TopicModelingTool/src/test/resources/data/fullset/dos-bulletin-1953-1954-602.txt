sures upon us were similar to a number of peo le
tugging at one person, the United States, wit a
vast number of ropes. When one ulled, there
was a corresponding tightening of t e rope held
by another. A wise Arab statesman to whom the
analogy was presented suggested that the only
recourse for the United States was, therefore, “to
divide justice.” Without arguing the conce t of
whether justice is in fact diVisible, we do an will
continue to make an honest effort to respond to the
needs of our friends within the limits of our own
national interests, our commitments, and our re-
sources, but we will also recognize as did the
Arab statesman, that we cannot lease all the
nations and special interests which are calling
upon us.
We have reluctantly inherited a position where
every action or lack of action, every word spoken
or left unsaid, is of signiﬁcance to one or all of
these nations, and it has become necessary to
wei h carefully the effect in one part of the
wordd of an attempted action in another. We
must see to it that we weigh these matters care-
fully if we are to live up to the position of leader-
shi in which we have been placed. Those who
feel)and speak with emotion on some of these prob-
lems must bear this in mind even if they are not
in positions of responsibility within the govern-
ment. The temper of our people is closely judged
from abroad as well as our daily acts in govern-
ment.
In all this range of problems it would be fool-
hardy to be 0 timistic. Yet it would be equally
dangerous an quite unwarranted to be totally
discouraged. Some progress is being made and
there are several grounds for encouragement. One
hope that I see is a steady growth of American
awareness of Middle Eastern roblems and a de-
termination to see the Unite States fulﬁll its
part in resolving those problems. Another ho e
is the general evolution now taking place in the
Middle East, whereby leaders are becoming more
reslponsive to the demands of public welfare. In
fu lling these demands there will inevitably be
change amounting to virtual revolution. We are
sympathetic with the motives behind this revolu-
tion and we would like to assist it as much as
possible to run in an orderly roductive channel.
I cannot close without as 'n all to weigh
gravel the world in which we we toda . De-
spite t e recent events at Eniwetok, it is still hard
for us to realize the unprecedented nature of the
danger recent scientiﬁc achievement has brought
upon us and equally hard to realize the prospects
0 future well-being that such discoveries, under
better world conditions, could also bring.
When one considers that man is at this very
time in the process of mastering weapons that
could destroy our civilization, one might think
that local political issues around the world should
become less signiﬁcant. But, when we consider
how these issues could expand step by step, until
April 26, 1954
the world could be led to war, we can only dedi-
cate ourselves humbl , with the guidance of our
Creator, to strive with renewed energy to see that
they are settled.
