The Process of Federatlng Europe
by Robert R. Bowie
Director, Policy Planning Staff ‘
Historically, federalism has been a process for
creating wider political communities for promot-
ing speciﬁc interests common to several existing
states. For the formation of a federation, the
component states must recognize that their prob-
lems and interests are common and that they can
not be effectively handled by the separate states or
b mere cooperation. Diagnosis has often been
3 ow and aiiiful. The federal remedy is not likely
to be a p ied until the ills have become acute and
less ra ical cures have clearly failed.
In the past, the problems which have most often
led to the formation of new federal states have
been defense and economic needs. In the United
States, in Australia, Canada, Switzerland, and
Germany, the federation had its origin in the
inability of the individual states to provide either
Security or viable economies in isolation. In each
case, some hi her political authority was needed to
mobilize their resources for common defense and
to facilitate trade and commerce among them.
The rapidity with which the need for a new
federal state is recognized and acted on depends
on many factors. Temperament, training, and in-
terest will make many people slow to accept the
necessity of federation. State ofﬁcials are likely
to be reluctant to acknowledge their own inca-
pacity to deal with the pressing problems. Those
who roﬁt by protected markets will resist the
need Ifor change. Existing loyalties and patriot-
isms will all counsel delay. Against such inertia
or opposition, the requisite support for federation
has generally been produced only by the threat of
military or economic disaster.
In many ways, the current efforts to achieve
European unity reveal a similar pattern. But
there is novelty and invention in the methods
adopted to make progress. The urgency of the
pro lems made it essential to begin at once and
roceed under forced draft. Hence in seeking to
build a supranational European government, the

proponents have relied heavily on the d namic
conception of federalism as an evolving an grow-
ing process. They have started with incomplete
measures, banking heavily on the continuance of
the process for their ultimate success.
The Postwar Sltuatlon In Europe
In terms of need, conditions in Europe after the
war were ripe for the creation of some form of
federal state.
By 1945, Europe had suffered a radical decline
in its power, economic well-bein , and morale.
For several centuries the states 0 Europe, with
their developed industries and military power, had
governed much of the world and sha ed its his-
tory. Their rivalries and nationalism ad broken
out into repeated conflicts which ultimately cul-
minated in two world wars. In their aftermath,
the situation was profoundly changed. Europe lay
almost impotent between two emergent giants—
the US. and the USSR.
Contemplating their plight, many Europeans
were bitterly disillusioned with nationalism. If
Europe was to survive, they concluded, it was es-
sential to ﬁnd some way to bury past hatreds and
to live and work together in peace. For the future,
France and Germany must somehow reconcile and
merge their vital interests. European unity,
which had been advocated as an ideal for cen-
turies, took on a new appeal as a practical pro-
gram. To a weakened and divided Europe, unity
offered a new faith and a vision of a peaceful and
stable future.
The economic reasons for European integration
went deeper than the war. For purposes of mod-
ern industry and commerce, the separate states of
Europe were too small. Tariﬂ's, uotas, currency
restrictions, transport barriers, an private cartels
all served to diVide Europe into a series of air-
tight markets, each too restricted for eﬁicient out-
ut and distribution. Any single state was power-
ess to correct the situation. It was forced to
consider only its separate interests and to impose
