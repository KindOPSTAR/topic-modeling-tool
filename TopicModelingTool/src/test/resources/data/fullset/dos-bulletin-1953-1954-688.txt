transportation, and by telegra hy, radio, motion
pictures, and television in the eld of communica-
tions, by medical science, by mass production and
by a whole range of other scientiﬁc developments.
These peaceful forces of science, commerce and
individual effort really do cause far-reaching in-
novations. Unhappily it is not often that a far-
reaching innovation is brought about in the world
exclusively by political and diplomatic means and
without ﬁghting. The inde endence of India is
one of those unusual cases. In the last few weeks
an event of far-reaching proportions was brought
about exclusively by litical and diplomatic
means. This was the dggision of Pakistan to be
counted with the free anti-Communist forces of
the world, and the decision of President Eisen-
hower to extend military aid to Pakistan. This
event and the recently signed agreement with Tur-
key, of which it is a part, can have a tremendously
stabilizing effect in one of the most crucial arts
of the world. It is a very real setback for om-
munist imperialism and should 've courage to
lovers of freedom in the Near an Middle East—
and all over the world. These are examples of
statesmanship with a capital S.
But it is not always possible to bring about such
basic changes in international relationships b
peaceful political and diplomatic means. VVb
Americans make a mistake if we expect too much
of the olitical and diplomatic tools which are
availablg to us. We should not have a sense of
failure because there is no peace treaty to conclude
World War II in an orderly manner; or because
there is no peace treaty establishing permanent
relationships in Palestine; or because there is as
yet no peace treaty for Korea. We should not be
contemptuous of more modest solutions because
we overestimate the possibility of curing all the
world’s ills in one fell swoop.
“Talk'or Fight"
And we should not get impatient with proceed-
ings of the United Nations or other international
gatherings because they talk and do not reach
basic solutions of some international questions.
To man of these questions there is no basic solu-
tion un er present conditions. In many of them,
the choice is: “talk or ﬁght.” The fact that the
talk may be boring or turgid or uninspiring should
not cause us to forget the fact that it is preferable
to war.
Now, the wars that don’t happen are not dra-
matic. But there is real satisfaction in working in
a place where you feel that sometimes you have
helped prevent ﬁghting and bloodshed even if it
requires some verbal toe dancing and walking on
eggs and what, to most of us, appears to be petti-
fogging. There are some circumstances in inter-
national aﬂ'airs when the best thing to do is to stall
for time and give people a chance to cool off. This
often clears the way for diplomacy to exert a
moderating and conciliatory inﬂuence. _
The United Nations has become an accepted in-
strument of last resort. A state need not feel it
has lost prestige by the reference of its problem to
the United Nations. Indeed, a state would lose
great prestige if it resisted the United Nations
playing its conciliatory role.
This process works even when ﬁ hting has al-
ready broken out—as in Indonesia, alestine, and
Kashmir. The United Nations succeeded in stop-
ping these conﬂicts—any of which might have
engulfed larger areas, or have so disrupted the
countries involved as to open the door to commu-
nism.
In this respect the United Nations is not—and
should not be—a good news source. When one of
the world’s insoluble problems gets on page one it
is practically always because the news is bad. The
di lomat who temporizes may be boring and jour-
nalistically undesirable, but he is useful in prevent-
ing bloodshed.
We Americans are right in our belief that the
world changes and that human effort can make it
chan nd can do it without ﬁghting. The
fatahsts are wron when they thi mankind is
doomed to being b own hither and yon like a cork
on the surface of the ocean. But we are wrong if
we expect international politics and diplomac to
do much more than fend off the destructive e ects
of science and invention—and human devilishness.
If a diplomat avoids a crisis, he is entitled to the
highest commendation. If, by his actions, he
avoids a war, he has really done all that a diplomat
is capable of doing and is entitled to the gratitude
of the nation. Let us not expect of diplomacy that
which it cannot accomplish. Without giving up
our Optimism and idealism, which are precious
assets to the world, let us learn to live with those
things which obviously cannot be altered by peace-
ful diplomatic methods.
Let us be thankful that we have a place like the
United Nations where di lomatic activities can
take place which can avoi crises and can prevent
war. Let us not hold the United Nations respon-
sible for the fact that it has not been able to remake
the world and bring about the millennium by a
stroke of the pen. After all, if a owerful govern-
ment like the United States could not conceivably
remake the world, how can we expect an instru-
ment like the United Nations, which has no powers
of government, which cannot draft a single soldier
or impose a single tax, to do that which a powerful
government cannot do?

which they do. I have been working With United
