former grantees deﬁnitely hold more favorable
views of the United States than persons who have
not visited this country. Furthermore, such
grantees are convinced, on the whole, of the sound-
ness of America’s foreign policy.
The exchange experience has also often en-
hanced the grantee’s position as an opinion leader.
A measure of this inﬂuence, in the country con-
cerned, was seen in recent elections, in which 70
of those reelected and 25 of those newly elected
to the national legislature were former grantees.
Many European government and private agen-
cies are reciprocating U.S. exchange efforts by
inviting Americans to visit their countries. Re-
cently, for example, the German Government in-
vited 48 American experts in the ﬁelds of religion,
welfare, and local government to tour Germany
at that Government s expense. German and Aus-
trian families have opened their homes during
summer months to American teen-agers in ac-
knowledgment of the German and Austrian teen-
age program conducted by the Department, under
which 2,000 youths have lived with American
families and attended local high schools since
1949. Other countries offering scholarshi op-
ortunities to Americans include the nited
ingdom, France, the Netherlands, all the Scandi-
navian countries, and Italy.
In the Near East and Africa
More than 900 exchanges were carried out with
26 countries in this area durin the last 6 months.
Embracing critical African, ear Eastern, and
South Asian countries, this area is characterized
by extreme nationalism and stron antiforeign
attitudes. The exchange program has helped to
develop local leadership and to inspire that lead-
ership with conﬁdence in the United States. For
example, Aref ben Musa, now in the Libyan Min-
istry of Foreign Affairs, interviewed by Tripoli’s
only Arab newspaper upon his return, talked of
impressions gained while in the United States as
an exchange student. Among other things, he
said, “I was able during my stay in the United
States to study and know the American people
and their various aspects of life, their democratic
spirit which they display at all times.” He spoke
of the “generosity of American families,” the
“brotherly atmosphere of cooperation in the
United States,” and the way “the individual relies
upon his personal ability for his position in so-
clety.”
An important art of the exchange program in
this area is the Bringing over of young persons
between the ages of 25 and 35 to study in American
colleges and universities. Most of these students
were active professional leaders in their home
countries at the time they received their invita-
tions—doctors, lawyers, government ofﬁcials.
What the American experience can mean to them
is demonstrated by an evaluation study conducted
in a representative Near Eastern country. This
study, which included student interviews before,
during, and after their trips, showed that largely
derogatory attitudes toward the United States
were transformed into favorable conce ts of this
country as a friendly, democratic, har working
Nation interested in the life and problems of
other countries.
The Department also brought over many out-
standing 0 inion leaders. In cooperation with
Princeton niversity and the Library of Congress,
the Department invited 35 eminent Muslim
scholars to a “Colloquium on Islamic Culture in
Its Relation to the Contemporary World.” Dele-
gates from Egypt, Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Jor-
dan, Yemen, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India,
Malaya, and Indonesia met with American
scholars who have specialized in the history and
culture of the Islamic world. Maximum public
information was given overseas on this event by
the U.S. Information Agency.
Plans have been made to bring over a group of
Southeast Asian journalists under a project which
has as its primary objective a demonstration of
the way in which responsible newspapers can
contribute to the economic, cultural, social, and
political development of a democratic society. In
addition to attendin a seminar arranged by the
American Press Institute of Columbia University,
these newsmen will tour the country to get an
objective view of American life and institutions
and an understanding of some of our problems.
Grants have been given also to individual educa-
tors from India, Thailand, Greece, Iraq, and
Pakistan to enable them to participate in a 6-
week seminar on higher education at the Univer-
sity of Chicago.
Among the American lecturers visiting this
area was Dr. Roy G. Blakey, an economist, who,
in addition to develo ing courses in public ﬁnance
and taxation for col ege students, served as con-
sultant to the Turkish Ministry of Finance. An-
other was Mrs. Dolores M. Carter, a lecturer in
dietetics who organized and put into operation
in Afghanistan a program of instruction in nutri-
tion, sanitation and health, home nursing, and
infant care.
The Department also encouraged and supported
the exchange of 101 persons with this area spon-
sored by private American and foreign groups.
A recent trend among these exchanges was the
interest of American students in visitin India
and other Southeast Asian countries. his in-
creased interest is attributable to a group of Amer-
ican students from the University of Southern
California, who carried out a plan that they en-
titled “Project India.” They lived and worked
with Indian students for 3 months in attempting
to correct misunderstandings about American life.
The Department also cooperated with the U.S.
National Student Association in arranging the
visits to this country of ﬁve outstanding Arab
