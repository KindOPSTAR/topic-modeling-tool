When the misery and devastation which re-
vailed in 1946 is considered and when we thin of
the hardships suffered during World War II, as
well as after, and when we recognize that the
Greek people fought and defeated large armed
guerrilla bands, only then is it possible to put into
true pers ective the nation’s tremendous achieve-
ments. Certainly the aid provided by the United
States was a vital factor. But the indis ensable
elements were the drive, the coura e, and t e vital-
ity of the Greek people and their etermination to
be free.
I pa them a full measure of tribute.
At t e resent time the Soviets and their Euro-
pean sate lites have adopted a calculated strate
of attempting to confuse the Greek people y
assuming a mask of loving-kindness.
But Greece knows full well that Soviet impe-
rialism respects only those who have the will and
the means to resist aggression. Accordingly, she
has allocated to her defense the maximum resources
consistent with the maintenance of a balance be-
tween security requirements and the requirements
of a stable economy.
The balance between security requirements and
the requirements for a continuously rising stand-
ard of living is always delicate, never static. We
recognize, as does the Greek Government, that an
effective solution of the problem of security must
be one which can endure for a long period of time.
We recownize and sym athize with the Greek
people’s desire to expan their economy as well as
to provide for their security. The United States
has assisted and will continue to assist in this
effort.
In other words, as between ourselves and the
Greeks, there is a true and effective cooperation
in matters of defense. The Greeks, for their part,
have made a brilliant effort to achieve a satis-
factory defense against aggression. The United
States, for its art, has provided materiel and
equipment for t e Greek military establishment.
It has also continued ﬁnancial assistance to the
Greek economy both in terms of dollars and in
terms of drachmae support to the Greek defense
budwet.
The Greek effort has added signiﬁcantl not
only to her own national security—but a so to
the security of the NATO area as a whole.
I had the pleasure at the airport in Washington
this morning of welcoming Mr. Kannellopoulos,
the Greek Minister of Defense, to the United
States. His visit provides another opportunity
to exchange views on these vital issues which are
continuously under review by our Governments.
We welcome his visit.
Sovlet Pollcy and the Free World
In addition to ties of cooperation between
Greece and the United States, our two nations are
bound together by the fact that we both face a
roblem, a menace, which confronts the entire
ree world, and one u on which our survival may
turn. I refer to the t ireat of Soviet imperialism.
Now, as in the past, Soviet free world rela-
tions turn, in the main, on the aggressive nature
of Soviet policy.
Since the last meeting of Forei Ministers 5
years ago, much has ha ened which could have
had an impact on the t inking and the lans of
the Kremlin leaders. The strength of t e West
has increased sharply. NATO is a oing concern
and has been broadened to inclu e Greece and
Turkey. European uniﬁcation is moving ahead.
Stalin has died. Meanwhile, the United Nations
resisted Communist aggression in Korea—and
drove the aggressors back of their line of depar-
ture. A truce has been made, in the course of
which the Chinese Communists have been put on
notice that if they violated the truce or renewed
their aggression, the 16 ﬁ hting members of the
United Nations Comman would be prompt to
resist and “in all probability, it would not be pos-
sible to conﬁne hostilities within the frontiers of
Korea.” In addition, the free nations have in-
sisted on nonforcible repatriation of prisoners of
war and have carried their point.
At the same time, it was difﬁcult to tell what or
how much inﬂuence these developments exerted on
the policy of the Soviet leaders. Obviously, un-
less we could obtain a satisfactory icture of the
intentions of the Kremlin, we woultfbe hampered
in putting our own policy into effect. Were such
small concessions as the remlin seemed to make
straws in the wind or bait for the unwary? A test
of Soviet intentions was in order. We therefore
agreed to a meeting at Berlin of the Foreign Min-
isters of Britain, France, the United States, and
the Soviet Union to negotiate a settlement of two
speciﬁc problems—the uniﬁcation of Germany and
a treaty for Austria.
I would like to emphasize what I know that
you know, that we went to the Berlin conference
in (food faith. We were not using the German
an Austrian matters as pawns in a lobal game
of chess with the Soviet Union. e were pre-
pared to a ree to any ractical and genuine pro-
posal whic would end) the division of German
and restore to the German people their inde en -
ence. And we were willin to consider any egit-
imate arrangements for t e completion of the
liberation of Austria.
I will grant that we were not optimistic on either
score. But we were determined to try.
You are all too familiar with the results of the
Berlin conference. The discussions achieved
neither the reuniﬁcation of Germany nor a treaty
for Austria. But what they did do was to force
Mr. Molotov to show Russia’s hand and to draw
the three Western Powers even more closely to-
gether. Russia’s hand, as Secretary Dulles put
it, was seen “as a hand that held fast to everything
it had, including East Germany and East Austria,
