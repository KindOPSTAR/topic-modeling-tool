The 10 major commodities in Brazilian coastal
trade in terms of volume are, in descending order:
salt, coal, sugar, lumber, wheat, ﬂour, rice, manioc
ﬂour, wood manufactures, beverages and iron and
steel manufactures.
Brazil’s coastal shipping is largely concentrated
upon the transportation of bulk raw materials
from the North and the South to the consuming
and manufacturing centers of Rio and $5.0 Paulo
and conversely transporting a smaller volume 0
manufactured items from these centers to both
the North and the South. The second major func-
tion is the transportation of foodstuffs such as
wheat, rice, manioc, beans, and charque (jerked
beef) from the southern producing regions to the
central and northern consumin areas.
The present Brazilian coastaf ﬂeet is composed
of 307 vessels of 609,000 dead weight tons. Over
25 percent of the total tonnage is above 40 years
of age, and ap roximatel 40 percent is more
than 30 years. he Brazilian coastal ﬂeet is pri-
marily composed of obsolete vessels, and newer,
small, converted landin vessels. Less than 30
ships may be considere as lar e, modern, eili-
ciepit vessels speciﬁcally designe for the coastal
tra e.
The ﬂeet described above must serve a coastline
over 5,500 miles long with 33 major, and many
smaller, ports. There is no competitive trans-
portation between the northern and southern ex-
tremities of the coastline and only fair road and
rail communication between the central southern
and northeastern regions.
The bill under discussion provides that every
vessel sold and transferred shall be subject to an
agreement by the Government of Brazil that the
vessels whether under mortgage to the United
States or not shall not engage in international
trade or in other than the coastwise trade of
Brazil. Moreover, United States ships cannot
operate in the Brazilian coastal trade since Brazil
has coastal laws similar to ours in that regard.
Consequently, such vessels will not be in competi-
tion With vessels operated by United States ship-
ping lines operating to Brazil.
As I have indicated, the sale of these vessels
as authorized by this legislation would contribute
to the economic development of Brazil, serve the
foreign policy of the United States by strengthen-
ing and helping to unify a friendly country in
this hemis here, and cannot adversely affect the
American erchant Marine.
