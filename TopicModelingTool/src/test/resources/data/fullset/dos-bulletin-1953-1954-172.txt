retary Dul’Zs during the rst week 0 the Foreign
Ministers’ Conference 10 ' h opene at Berlin on

dwm on the ramiﬁcation of Germany submitted by

Kingdom on January 29.
STATEMENT OF JANUARY 26
Preea release 38 dated January 27
This conference affords us the chance to re-
capture the lofty spirit of those who, with sacriﬁ-
cial dedication, won for us the chance to make the
peace. The United States has come here, and will
.rsevere, in that spirit. During the 9 years that
ave elapsed since t e end of World War II, man
hopes have turned to despair and many frien -
ships have dissolved in bitternem. It is, indeed, 5
years since our four Foreign Ministers have even
met together.‘ Those 5 years have been marked
by a major war in Korea, the intensiﬁcation of war
in Indochina, and owing fear that we are merely
in another interlu e between world wars.
This Conference rovides the occasion for mak-
ing a fresh start. Ve meet here in a city whose
rum and division symbolize the tragic conse-
quences of aggression. Here it should be possible,
in a mood of equalizing humility, to work together
for peace.
W hen we came here we knew that there were
many matters where we disagreed. But we hoped
to ﬁnd an area of agreement which, if it were
jointly cultivated, would invigorate peaceful prin-
ci les which would ﬁnally encompass us all, every-
w ere. “'e thought that Germany and Austria
provided such an initial ﬁeld for successful effort.
That was the mood which was made manifest
by the opening speeches of M. Bidault and Mr.
‘ The sixth session of the Council of Foreign Ministers
took place at Paris in May—June 1949.
Eden. Neither of them uttered a single word
of recrimination. Both dealt constructively with
the future and sought the coo eration which would
enable the four of us to buil here in the heart of
Europe a society which, turning its back upon the
tragic past, would be a monument of enduring
peace.
It was thus a matter of profound disap int-
ment to hear the o ning address of the ggviet
Foreign Minister. T: was not that he said any-
thing that was new. I have heard the same speech
many times before. \Vhat was saddening was the
fact that he seized upon this Occasion, the o iening
of this new conference, this beginning of what
could be a new chapter of history, to accumulate
and re mat the old false charges and recrimina-
tions w iich have been heard so often from Soviet
rulers.
If any one thing is certain, it is that the future
will never be a future of peace unless it reﬂects
new ideas and new vision. Peace is not had
merely by wanting it. “'e all, I suppose, want
peace, on our own terms. Men have always
wanted peace on their own terms. Instead of get-
ting peace, they have gotten an endless cycle of
recurrent war. War has constantly bred war be-
cause, with rare exceptions, the victors in war have
been so animated by the spirit of vengeance and
hatred that they have been blinded and have
themselves unwittingly become the causes of new
war.
If, from this standpoint, we review the three
speeches which were made yesterday, we cannot
but be struck by the difference. M. Bidault and
Mr. Eden both made constructive proposals for
Germany, which, because they were just, would
be lasting. They groposed a Germany which
would be united nii er a government of its own
choosing and which would bury its antiquated na-
tionalistic and militaristic ambitions in a durable
unity with those who in the past have been the
victims of its aggression.
