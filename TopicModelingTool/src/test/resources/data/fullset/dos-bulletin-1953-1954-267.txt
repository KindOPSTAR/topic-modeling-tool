in the text of the Soviet note, the Turkish reply
ac nowledged
with satisfaction the statement in which the Use: Gov-
ernment states that the User; has no territorial claims
on Turkey. The Turkish Government states that the
interest in preserving good neighborly relations and
strengthening peace and security to which the above
statement refers, fully corresponds with interests which
always have been shown and will continue to be shown
by Turkey. The Turkish Government considers it
necessary to underline, in connection with the above,
that the question of the Black Sea Straits, as is known
to the Soviet Government, is regulated by the provisions
of the Montreux Convention.
Two days later on July 20, the Soviet Govern-
ment resented another note on the Straits to Am-
bassa or Hozar in order, evidently, to kee the
subject alive. The new note had a special ear-
ing on Turkish-American and Anglo-Turkish
relations: 1’
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has informed
the Soviet Embassy in Ankara that between July 22—27,
United States naval units, consisting of ten ships, includ-
ing two cruisers, three destroyers, four minesweepers, and
one landing craft, will visit the port of Istanbul.
Following this the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Aii'airs
informed the Soviet Embassy that between July 27 and
August 3, British naval vessels, consisting of 22 units,
including three cruisers, four destroyers, six minesweep-
ers and four landing vessels will visit the port of Istanbul.
In connection with this report of the Turkish Ministry
of Foreign Affairs one cannot but draw attention to the
fact that recently entry into ports in the Black Sea
Straits by units of foreign navies, including large naval
vessels, has become more frequent, and that the above
mentioned visits to the port of Istanbul by 10 American
naval vessels and 22 British naval vessels can be con-
sidered as a kind of military demonstration.
The Soviet Government, therefore, hoped “to re-
ceive additional information” from Turkey with
regard to the visit of these warshi s to Istanbul.
The Turkish Government replie to the Soviet
note on July 24, merely stating that, under articles
14 and 17 of the Montreux Convention, there was
full freedom for courtesy visits of warships, both
as to tonnage and composition, and that it was
“impossible to inter ret the frequency of these
visits as anything 0t er than an auspicious mani-
festation of the bonds of friendship that exist be-
tween Turkey and the states whose naval units are
invited to make the visits in question.” This being
the situation, and in view of the fact that, in ac-
cordance with the Montreux Convention, the So-
viet Union had been notiﬁed of the visits, the
Turkish Government was “astonished” that the
Soviet Government had “found it necessary to re-
quest supplementary information of a nature that
could be construed to be a sort of interference in
a matter which international custom leaves to the
discretion of the states concerned.”
" Under article 17 of the Montreux Convention a naval
force of any tonnage or composition may pay a courtesy
visit of limited duration to a port in the Straits at the in-
vitation of the Turkish Government, but must leave by
the same route by which it entered. unless it fulﬁlls the
conditions for passage laid down in articles 10, 14, and 18.
On July 31 the Soviet Government presented
another note to Turkey, reiterating its communi-
cation of July 20 and reviewing the Turkish reply.
In addition, the Soviet Government summarized
the data as to the visits of foreign warships in
the Straits since 1945, as follows: ‘8
1950 _______ __33 warships, 197,000 tons displacement
1951 _______ __49 warships, 378,800 tons displacement
1052 _______ “69 warships, 587,727 tons displacement
During the ﬁrst seven months of 1953, it was
stated, sixty warships, of more than 300,000 tons,
had Visited in the region of the Straits. Thus,
the Soviet Government indicated that in recent
years the visits of “large formations of foreign
warships to the Black Sea Straits” had considera-
bly increased. These visits had reached such a
high level that the Soviet Government felt its re-
quest for additional information from the Turk-
ish Government could not be regarded as “unusual
or unexpected.” But the Turkish Government,
in view of its July 24 note, did not consider a
reply necessary.
Premier Malenkov’s address before the Su-
preme Soviet of the Soviet Union on August 8
which touched, amon other things, on problems
of the Near and Mi dle East generally and on
Soviet-Turkish relations in particular, is of in-
terest in the light of the Soviet-Turkish exchange
with respect to the Straits and of the Soviet “peace
offensive.” Premier Malenkov said:
In everybody’s memory is the statement made by the
Soviet Government to the Government of Turkey. This
statement establishes essential prerequisites for the de-
velopment of good-neighborly relations if, of course, the
Turkish side is to show in its turn due efforts in this
direction. The improvement of relations between Tur-
key and the Soviet Union would undoubtedly serve the
interests of both sides and make an important contribu-
tion to the strengthening of security in the Black Sea
area.
Premier Malenkov also noted the Soviet initia-
tive in proposing the exchange of envo s, “after
a long interval,’ with Yugoslavia an Greece,
and expressed the hope that this would “lead to
appropriate normalization of relations with both
countries” and “ roduce useful results.”
The Turkish dbvernment, however, sensed that
behind the Soviet moves was a desire to weaken
the North Atlantic Treat Organization and, in
effect, to isolate the Unite States from its allies."

"It is worthy of note that, in his address of Septem-
ber 21 in the U. N. General Assembly. Mr. Vyshinsky re-
peated all the familiar charges against “the aggressive
North Atlantic bloc,” and then stated: “The whole course
of its policy from its earliest days proves that the Soviet
Union seeks to strengthen good-neighbourly relations with
other countries and that it has no territorial claims on
any State. including its neighbors" (U. N. doc. A/PVA38,
pp. 51—61, especially paragraph 25).
Turkey was elected to the Security Council on October
5, to succeed Greece.
