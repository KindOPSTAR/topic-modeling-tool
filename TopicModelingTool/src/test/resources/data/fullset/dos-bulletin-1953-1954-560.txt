The Importance of Indochina
by Under Secretary Smith 1
Q. Why is Indochina important to Americans?
Mk. SMITH: For one vital basic and two special
additional reasons. In the ﬁrst place, the vital
basic uestion is: Shall we or can the free world
allow its position anywhere and particularly in
Asia to be eroded piece by piece? Can we allow,
dare we ermit, expansion of Communist Chinese
control urther into Asia? l’ropagandists of the
Soviet Union and of Communist China have made
it clear that their purpose is to dominate all of
Southeast Asia. Remember that this region helps
to feed an immense population. It stretches all
the way from India to Ja an. It’s a region that is
rich in raw materials, fu l of tin, oil, rubber, iron
ore.
Now, from the strategic oint of view, it lies
across the most direct sea an air route between the
Paciﬁc and South Asia. There are major naval
and air bases located in the area. Communist
control of Southeast Asia would threaten the
Phili pines, Australia, and New Zealand directly,
woul threaten Malaya; it would have a very pro-
found eﬁ'ect upon the economy of other countries
in the area, even as far as Japan.
Q. The President, at his news conference on
April 7, described the process of Communist con-
quest as the “fallin domino” principle. Is that a
good description 0 the threat in Southeast Asia?
MR. SMITH: Yes, it is. If Indochina is lost to
the Communists, Burma is threatened, Thailand is
threatened, the Malay Peninsula is exposed, Indo-
nesia is subject to the gravest danger, and, in addi-
tion to these countries and their possible loss, there
is the possible loss of food source. I have already
mentioned the strategic raw materials, the bases in
the area; and, while they are of enormous impor-
tance, the most important thing of all is the pos-
sible loss of millions and millions of people who
would disappear behind the Iron Curtain. There
are enough millions behind the Iron Curtain now.
So what’s at stake in Indochina? It is the human

freedom of the masses of people for all that enor-
mous area of the world.
h Q? General Smith, can Indochina be saved, and
0w
MR. SMITH: The position of the United States
is that, if there is a united will among the free
nations East and West, a will that is made clear to
the Communists so there can be no misunderstand-
ing on their art, that this of itself would give
pause for furt 1er adventures and aggression.
Secretary Dulles said in an address on April 7: '
“The potential danger in the situation is very
great, and it needs to be soberly appraised with a
view to seeing whether a united Wlll can be cre-
ated. \Vith a united will created the need for
united action might diminish.” Mr. Dulles is in
London now, and from there he will go to Paris
to exchange views and to determine the possibili-
ties of strengthening the situation. Other coun-
tries in the area are vitally concerned, and they
recognize the existing peril. Thailand has al-
ready indicated that they are willing to stand
with us in an association of nations to limit the
possibility of further Communist penetration in
the area.
Q. We already a more than 70 percent of the
cost of this war. {Thy is not that enough?
MR. Smrn : I don’t minimize the importance of
American aid. “"e’ve done a very great deal. But
I think it is misleading to depict the war in Indo-
china in terms of percenta es. There is no ques-
tion about the extent and t 1e nature of the sacri-
ﬁces of the French in supportin and ﬁghting this
war. They have been at it now or almost 8 years.
A mere statement of percenta of cost would
leave out the human factor of rench and Indo-
chinese casualties. American assistance isn’t only
in the form of ns, ammunition, and materiel,
but it is also in t 1e form of support for the whole
budgetary position of France due to the grave
commitments that France has both in the Far
East and in Europe. The only additional request
we have had recently has been to meet the special
military situation at the moment, and that’s the
