vening b the Chairman. The Chairman was
instructs to take account of further discussions
in the International Tin Study Group ’ and decide
at a later date whether conditions existed for re
sumption of the Conference, following consulta-
tion with the governments which are members of
its Steerin Committee.
The Stu y Group met at London in March 1953.
Member govermnents reviewed the position and
pros ts of the world tin situation and empha-
siz the continuing large excess of production
over consumpgion. Strategic stockpiles were not
expected to able to absorb very much longer
this excess supply, which is approximate] 30
rcent of consumption. The Chairman 0 the
UN. Conference requested advice regarding fur-
ther negotiations toward an intergovernmental
control arrangement. The Study Group believed
additional preparato work would be advisable
and appointed a Wor in Party to consider pro-
posals regarding international action and provide
advice to the Chairman regarding a second session
of the U.N. Conference.
The Working Party considered ossible forms
of an agreement which might be e ective and ac-
ceptable. A subcommittee prepared a draft agree-
ment to serve as a basis for discussion in a second
session if the U.N. Conference should be recon-
vened. The Working Party requested member
governments of the Study Group to consider the
problems and the roposals. Each of these gov-
ernments was asked) to communicate directly to the
Chairman its views regarding a reconvening of
the U.N. Conference.
The views expressed by governments showed
that another ne otiation was desired by a number
of countries ans was not opposed by any govern-
ment. The United States explained that it would
attend if another session was desired by a sufﬁcient
number of overnments to justify the reconvening
of the Con erence. However, the letter submitted
by the United States noted that a. negotiation in
November 1953 would come at a time when this
Government was making a basic review of its
economic foreign policy. The United States
would, therefor not be in a position to commit
itself to a speci 0 course of action at that time.
The other interested overnments were placed on
notice that the Ullle States would regard a 1953
conference as useful for examining possible lines
of action but would expect any suggested programs
to be open for consideration over a period of time
following the Conference.
On the basis of these expressions by the member
governments of the International Tin Study
Group and the Steering Committee of the Con-
ference, the Chairman requested a Second Session
and the Secretary-General of the United Nations
made the necessary arrangements. Invitations

Special Difﬁculties in Tin
Tin has many and varied uses which are im-
portant and even essential to the economy and
security of industrialized countries. The volume
of consumption is weaker, however, on a long-term
basis than that of most raw materials because of
the increase in conservationa] practices in the use
of tin and a persistent trend toward displacement
by the substitution of other materials.
Countries which consume tin are almost entirely
dependent upon imports for adequate supplies.
The areas in which tin is produced have not under
gone extensive economic development or diversi-
cation. Practically all of their roduction of tin
is exported, and earnings from t ese exports are
very signiﬁcant elements in their economies.
Tin mining is the principal source of employ-
ment, foreign exchange, and overnmenta] reve-
nues in Bolivia. Although Bolivia is more heavily
dependent on this industry than are other produc-
ing countries, the production of tin also has con-
siderable importance in Malaya, Indonesia,
Belgian Congo, Thailand, and Nigeria. Those
areas also have the problem of limited opportuni-
ties for a prom t reemployment of resources.
The demand or tin is not appreciably affected in
the short run by the level of its price smce the cost
comprises such a small proportion of the value of
ﬁnis ied products. Substantial] increasing or de-
creasin the volume of tin pro uction takes con-
siderab e time regardless of the immediate
attractiveness or unattractiveness of market prices.
These characteristics make for periodical surpluses
and shortages and extreme peaks and troughs of
prices. Importing and ex orting countries have
been adversely affected by tlie extreme ﬂuctuations
of price to which tin has been subject in the past.
Several efforts were made on an international scale
during the twenties and thirties to curb the vio-
lence of these price swings and achieve a greater
degree of stability in the industry.
The interested governments have recognized for
several years a possibility that the termination of
