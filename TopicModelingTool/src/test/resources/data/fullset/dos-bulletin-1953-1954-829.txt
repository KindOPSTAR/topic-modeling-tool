News Conference Statement by Secretary Dulles
Press release 280 dated May 25
The Emperor of Ethiopia, Haile Selassie I, has
arrived in this country and is expected here in
Washington tomorrow. We welcome his arrival
here very much.
Ethiopia is the oldest independent country in
Africa and it has been a Christian nation since the
fourth century. The United States has had dip-
lomatic relations with Ethiopia for over 50 years.
The Emperor of Ethiopia has demonstrated since
the earliest da s of his reign the highest devotion
to the princip es of collective security. Ethiopia
has been a steadfast supporter of the United Na-
tions and the Emperor’s countrymen have been
among the most courageous of our comrades-in-
arms in Korea. I am conﬁdent that the American
people will extend their heartiest welcome to the
Emperor, whom we have long respected and
admired and whose people we count on as friends
and allies.

Technical Cooperation and the American Heritage
by Harold E. Stassen
Director, Foreign Operations Admim'stration1
Before I begin this brief discussion of our tech-
nical cooperation programs, I should like to ex-
press my genuine admiration for the outstanding
support that you have given these programs from
the pulpits of your churches.
There has been submitted for the consideration
of the Congress a technical cooperation program
for the coming year of $131.6 million. This is
an increase of more than $24 million over the sum
that was appropriated for the present year’s
activities.
As the ancient and time-tested enemy of op res-
sion and the undaunted champion of brother 00d
amon all men, the religious leadership of America
has p ayed a decisive role in gathering the en-
thuSiastic support of the American people for
expanded programs of technical cooperation.
‘ Address made before the Ministerial Union of Wash-
ington, Washington, D.C., on May 24.
These programs are more than a reﬂection of
the highest American humanitarianism; their
concept springs from the moral and ethical ob-
ligations of man to his fellow men, which are the
strength and foundation of Christian tradition.
In this respect it is highly ﬁtting that technical
cooperation should be part of a ositive American
foreign policy; for foreign olicy has identical
origins with our everyday ives—the religious
principles and the democratic recepts which are
the wellsprings of the practical) idealism that has
made America great.
There are as many paths to progress as there
are nations and peo les. Technical cooperation
rograms seek to exp ore these paths, to exchange
ideas and methods, theories and practices, and,
by this fusion of mankind’s accumulated knowl-
edge and ex erience, to ﬁnd the best ways to
lay the bail ing blocks for a better world of
tomorrow.
