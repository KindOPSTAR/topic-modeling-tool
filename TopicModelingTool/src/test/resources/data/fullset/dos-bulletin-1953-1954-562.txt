Strengthening of Anglo-American Ties
by le'nthrop W. Aldrich
Ambassador to Great Britain ‘
Recently, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles
said:
There is need, as never before, of cooperation between
the free nations. Others recognize that. So do we. To
maintain a cooperation of the free is a difﬁcult and delicate
process. Without mutual respect and friendship it would
be impossible.
It is my ﬁrm belief, which I am sure you must
share, that nothing accelerates “mutual respect and
friendship” like personal association and under-
standing. A theoretical knowledge of other people
and countries can never take the place of knowl-
edge gained by actual experience.
The times in which we live have made it impos-
sible for us not to concern ourselves about the
safety and well-being of our friends.
This concern cannot be a “Father knows best”
attitude, which by its nature is self-defeating. As
Mr. Dulles said in Caracas a few weeks ago:
We do not believe in a world of conformity. We believe
that there is a richness in diversity. Just as this universe
in which we live was created as a universe of diversity, so
the human institutions which man builds are properly
diverse, to take account of human and geographical
differences.
To break down barriers of prejudice and to
create conditions in which our mutual knowledge
and skills can be freely exchanged are surel two
of our primary objectives today. Persona ly, I
am com letely convinced that these aims are best
achiev through the exchanges of persons, and
it is one of the most heartening developments of
the postwar ears that these exchanges, on both
governmenta? and private levels, have increased
so enormously.
The old, established programs like the Rhodes
Scholarships, which I feel have ielded incalcu-
lable good to my country and to t e Empire, have
been augmente by many other similar schemes.
Most of you are familiar with the Fulbright and
teacher-exchange programs. as well as with the
Leverhulme and Nuﬂield Fellowshi s. We are
particularly proud that last year the ritish Gov-
‘Arldress made before the Phamhcrs of Commerce of
East Anglia at Norwich, Eng. on Mar. 26.
ernment established the Marshall Scholarships, in
honor of Gen. George Catlett Marshall, under
which 12 American students each year will be in-
vited to study at British universities.
In mv country, American members and friends
of the English Speaking Union have recently set
up a fund to honor King George VI under which
it is hoped that at least 50 students a year from
the Commonwealth will be invited to study at
American universities.
Elsenhower Fellowships
A more recent fund of this kind, about which
you ma not have heard, has been set up in the
form 0 the Eisenhower Exchange Fellowships.
The President’s deep convictions about the impor-
tance of the exchange principle inspired a group
of his fellow citizens to create these fellowships
as a birthday gift to him. With an ultimate aim
of 100 students a year from all parts of the free
world, fellowships will be given to applicants
from such ﬁelds as communications, engineering,
agriculture, and business.
All of us realize, however, that vitally impor-
tant as these programs are, they are only a start in
the right direction. Travel and exchange on a
mass scale are to my mind the ultimate oal, but
until we can work out the complicated difﬁculties
of international ﬁnance we must try to perfect the
means we have at hand.
In a way, I feel it is almost an impertinence to
talk to the people of Norwich about the impor-
tance of understanding between our two countries.
After all, you opened your hearts and your homes
to the Americans here during the war. ﬂying from
such bases as Snetterton, Horsham, Saint Faith,
Thorpe-Abbott, and Watton. Our ﬂiers wore
olive-drab uniforms in those days, and ﬂew Thun-
derbolts, Liberators, and Flying Fortresses. The
kinship born of so many similarities of tongue and
belief was cemented in the mutual effort against
a common foe.
When peace came—and sometimes listening in
the cold. dark nights to the drone of the planes
overhead it must have seemed that it would never
