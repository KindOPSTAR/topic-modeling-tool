Korea resently has effective control over only
part of orea. If either contracting state should
initiate an armed attack against any territory
not under its administrative control when the
treaty was si ed or thereafter recognized by the
other as law ully brou ht under the adminlstra-
tive control of the ﬁrst, t ie treaty would not apply.
Under its terms the treaty could continue to be
applicable in event that a political settlement
unifying Korea is reached. In the Australian
and New Zealand and Philippine treaties the
area within which they are to operate is deﬁned
in a separate article.
Article IV grants to the United States the
right to dispose land, air, and sea forces in and
about the territory of Korea as determined by
mutual agreement. It does not make such disposn-
tion automatic or mandatory.
According to article VI, the treaty has indeﬁ-
nite duration, but either party may terminate
it 1 year after notice is given.
In view of the importance of this treaty as a
deterrent to aggression and thus to the mainte-
nance of peace and security in the Paciﬁc area, it
is hoped that it will be given early and favorable
consideration by the Senate.
Respectfully submitted.

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY DULLES 1
Press release 11 dated January 18
The Mutual Defense Treaty between the Re-
public of Korea and the United States has been
submitted by the President to the Senate for its
advice and consent to ratiﬁcation. The treaty is
an outgrowth of our experience with aggressive
communism and represents a careful] considered
attempt to prevent, insofar as possi le, a recur-
rence of that aggression in orea.
Before turning to the speciﬁc rovisions of the
treaty, I want to tell you why think it is im-
portant and necessary.
It is doubtful that the Korean war would have
broken out if the Communist a gressors had
known in advance what the United IStates and the
United Nations would do. They miscalculated.
They thought that they would meet no 0 position
exce t from the Re ublic of Korea itsel , and the
RO ’s at that time ad only a small military force
designed primarily to preserve the internal
security.
The Communists did not expect that only a few
hours after they struck, June 25, 1950, the United
Nations Security Council would move rapidly to
set in motion an international military action to
repel the aggrewion. Nor did they expect that
’ Made before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
on Jan. 13.
the United States would take a vi orous role as
leader and chief contributor to the nited Nations
eﬂ'ort to help the Republic of Korea to drive back
the invaders. Nor could the aggressors know that
the United Nations effort would be maintained
through more than 3 years of bloody strife which
ended in an armistice on July 27, 1953.
It is against this background of Communist mis-
calculation that the ﬁrst major purpose of the
treaty becomes clear. It is to prevent any renewal
of the Communist ag ression in Korea by joining
with the Republic 0% Korea in a clear and un-
equivocal statement of our common determination
to defend ourselves against external armed attack,
so that no potential a gressor can be under the
illusion that either 0% us stands alone in the
Paciﬁc area.
The second major purpose of the treaty is to
give to the Government and the people of the Re-
public of Korea formal assurance of our continued
concern for their security as a art of the fabric
of peace in the Paciﬁc area. t is an assurance
to which they are fully entitled by their valiant
and unwavermg struggle against the Communist
invaders. It was an assurance which they sought
as the armistice ne otiations were drawmg to a
close. They knew t at the Communist threat re-
mained poised in the north, ready to strike again.
They wanted, from us, a deterrent to that threat.
Last May and June, while the armistice was
being negotiated, there was an exchange of letters
between President Rhee and President Eisen-
hower,8 in the course of which President
Eisenhower stated that he was “prepared promptly
after the conclusion and acce tance of an armi-
stice to negotiate” with Presi ent Rhee a mutual
defense treaty along the lines of the treaties here-
tofore concluded between this country and other
Paciﬁc nations. The President’s proposal was, at
the time, discussed with congressional leaders.
In subsequent efforts to work out an understand-
ing between the United States and the Republic of
Korea on an armistice with the Communists, I ave
Walter S. Robertson, Assistant Secreta of tate
for Far Eastern Aﬂ'airs, the mission 0 goin to
Korea in late June to consult with Presi ent
Syngman Rhee. A considerable area of agree-
ment was reached by Mr. Robertson and President
Rhee.“ The armistice with the Communists was
signed on July 27, 1953; and shortly thereafter I
ﬂew to Korea to exchange further views with
President Rhee on what should be done to secure
Korea against the Communist threat and to ad-
vance the cause of independence and unity for the
Korean people. In the course of those discussions,
I negotiated with President Rhee the text of the
