Persecution of Jews in Rumania
Press release 294 dated June 8
Deputy Under Secretary Murphy on June 8 re-
ceived a delegation from the American Jewish
Committee for an exchange of views concerning
the recent persecution of Jews in Rumania. In-
cluded in the delegation were Jacob Blaustein,
Herman Gray, and Seymour Rubin. At the con-
clusion of the discussion Mr. Murphy made the
following statement:
In recent months the Rumanian Communist
regime has brought to trial and sentenced to lon
prison terms scores of Rumanian Jews. Many 0
these recentl sentenced have been held in prison
without tria for several years, their only crime
being that the regime considers them undesirable.
The fate of the victims of this widespread perse-
cution is cause for deep concern on the part of the
Department of State as well as the American
J ewish Committee.
The conduct of the Rumanian Government in
this instance is but one more example of its callous
disregard for human rights and fundamental
freedoms. In order to instill fear in the hearts
of the 250,000 Jews in Rumania that Government
has found it necessary to sentence leaders of the
Jewish community so that they might be held as
hostages. Such conduct is not only in violation
of the provisions of the Treaty of Peace with
Rumania but also ignores the dictates of justice
and humanity.
I am deepl moved by the tra 'c plight of these
unfortunate Jewish leaders an sympathize with
the feelings expressed by members of the dele-
gation from the American Jewish Committee.

statement on the occasion of the inauguration of
Sir Donald McGillioray as High Commissioner
for the Federation of Malaya to succeed General
Sir Gerald Templer,-
In the past 2 years, under the leadership of
General Sir Gerald Templer, marked progress
has been made in Malaya to halt Communist ter-
rorism there and to build up a self-governing na-
tion. It is with a sense of gratiﬁcation that the
peoples of the free world have watched the ad-
vance toward these goals.
In Malaya, as elsewhere, people have increas-
ingly recognized communism for what it is—an
attempt by force and subtlety to exploit their
