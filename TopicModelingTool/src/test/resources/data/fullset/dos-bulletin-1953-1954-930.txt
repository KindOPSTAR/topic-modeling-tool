with the Soviets. It is a pit that thus far the
negative attitude of the U.S.S. . has prevented us
from moving ahead on this vital matter.
I would also mention on the credit side the Gen-
eral Assembly’s formal recognition that Puerto
Rico has attained “a full measure of self-govern-
ment,” the report to the Trusteeship Councid com-
mending the United States for its administration
of the Trust Territory of the Paciﬁc Islands, and
the Assembly’s resolution encouraging underde-
veloped countries to create economic and political
conditions favorable to private capital investment.
These positive accomplishments or proposals
may take little time to recount, but the reﬂect
months of painstaking preparation, skillful di-
plomacy, and patient negotiation. They also
demonstrate how the United Nations can advance
our own and the free world’s interests.
The problems I have been talking about were
not created by the United Nations. They exist in
spite of it. They reﬂect the tense, contracting, and
interdependent world in which we live. The
United Nations oﬂ’ers the best hope for solving
these problems.
One of the remarkable things about the United
Nations is its ﬂexibility. It provides not only a
way to repel aggression, as in Korea, but also the
means to detect situations which might eventually
embroil many nations in ﬁghting. The United
Nations has an effective ﬁre-alarm system which
can be used before problems reach a critical, ex-
plosive stage.
The function of this system is dramatized at this
time by the appeal for United Nations observers
which the Government of Thailand made to the
Security Council last week. As you know, Thai-
land, or Siam, borders on two of the Indochinese
states, Laos and Cambodia.
In making his appeal before the Security Coun-
cil, which voted 10—1 to put it on the agenda, the
Ambassador of Thailand said:
. . the situation in territories bordering on Thai-
land has become so exp10sive and tension is so high that
a very real danger exists that ﬁghting may spread to
Thailand and the other countries of the area and that
foreign troops may effect direct incursions into Thai
territory.
The observer mechanism of the United Nations
has been little publicized, but it has had a com-
paratively long and successful record.
Development 0! Watchdog System
Let me review how this United Nations watch-
dog system has developed.
GREECE
Actually, the ﬁrst use and development of the
United Nations observer system in areas of inter-
D—
national tension took place in connection with the
threat of aggression against Greece during the
period of the guerrilla war there from 1947 to 1949.
You may remember that a Commission of Investi-
gation of the Security Council, after several
months of travel and study of the situation on the
s ot, had reported that the countries bordering
Ciieece on the North were illegally giving aid to
the Communist guerrillas in an ﬁ'ort to overthrow
the legitimate Greek Government. When the re-
peated use of the veto by the Soviets in the Secu-
rity Council prevented action by that body, the
problem of the threat to Greece was taken to the
General Assembly in the fall of 1947. The As-
sembly then created the S ecial Committee on the
Balkans and empowered it to observe and re ort.
to the United Nations on the disturbed relations
between Greece and its northern neighbors. The
United States was chosen as one of the nine coun-
tries which served on this United Nations Special
Committee. It proceeded immediately in late 1947
to Northern Greece, where its headquarters were
established at Salonika. Adm. Alan G. Kirk, at
that time American Ambassador to Belgium and
subsequently Ambassador to the U.S.S.R., was the
ﬁrst United States representative on this Special
Committee for the Balkans. This is the same Ad-
miral Kirk who, 10 years ago this month, com-
manded our Navy in the Normandy invasion.
Admiral Kirk and his colleagues soon recog-
nized that, in order to carry out its duty of obser-
vation and reporting on the situation along the
northern frontiers, the Committee would need the
assistance of trained military personnel in suf-
ﬁcient numbers to permit speedy investigation at
the scene of frontier incidents or attacks by the
guerrillas. During the most active period of the
guerrilla war, that is in 1948 and 1949, there were
about 35 such military observers, furnished by the
United States, the United Kingdom, France, the
Republic of China, the Netherlands, Brazil, and
Mexico.
Under the direction of this United Nations Com-
mittee, the observers operated in teams of three,
each with its own interpreters and radio communi-
cations equipment, at advance stations at key spots
along Greece’s northern frontiers from Albania
on the West to Bulgaria on the East, a distance of
nearly 500 miles through mountainous terrain.
From these advance posts the observers made regu-
lar inspection tours along their particular sector
of the frontier. They moved rapidly to investigate
speciﬁc incidents or situations as they arose in
order to obtain fresh and timely evidence. In
carrying out their duties several of these observers
were seriously wounded either by escaping Greek
guerrillas or by guards on the other side of the
international frontier. These observers had the
cooperation of Greek Army authorities and gained
the conﬁdence and respect of the people of
Northern Greece, who, seeing the observers in their
