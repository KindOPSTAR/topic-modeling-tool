The Foundations of American Attitudes
by H. Freeman Matthews
Ambassador to the Netherlands 2
It is a great privilege for me to be with you
tonight and to have the opportunity of telling you
some of my thoughts about American foreign
policy. There is one Iparticular aspect of that
olicy upon which I s ould like to concentrate.
t is a very important aspect and one which I be-
lieve deserves more attention than is usually iven
to it. That is the attitude of the United gtates
toward its friends and allies.
Last December, our Secretary of State, John
Foster Dulles, replying to some American critics
of American foreign policy, made the following
statement:
It is the clear and ﬁrm purpose of this Administration
to treat other free nations as sovereign equals, whether
they be large or small, strong or weak. . . .
Today it is to our interest to assist certain countries.
But that does not give us the right to try to take them
over, to dictate their trade policies, and to make them our
satellites.
Indeed, we do not want weak or subservient allies. Our
friends and allies are dependable just because they are
unwilling to be anyone’s satellites. They will freely sacri-
ﬁce much in a common effort. But they will be no more
subservient to the United States than they will be sub-
servient to Soviet Russia.
Let us be thankful that they are that way and that there
still urvives so much rugged determination to be free.
If that were not so, we would be isolated in the world and
in mortal peril.‘
Mr. Dulles clearly and vigorously expressed in
these sentences a cardinal tenet of American for-
eign policy The United States seeks no other
course, wi I pursue no other course, than that of

The Netherlands Government can he justiﬁably
proud of the initiative and leadership that they

And I am proud that your Government has

friendly and understanding cooperation in its
relations with other free nations.
It is true that only recently in our history has
the necessity for international coo eration a -
peared to us to be really essential. (gnly recent y
have the American people become so aware of
what I shall call the “global” responsibilities of the
United States.
In the early history of my country during our
stru gle for freedom there was a watchword:
“United we stand, divided we fall.” The Ameri-
can people, having witnessed the turbulent and
tra 'c history of our century, recognize that this
18t century cry has equal validity in the present
troubled state of the world. As a consequence,
wholehearted cooperation with other free nations
has become a cornerstone of American foreign
policy, a princi le su ported by both political
arties in the nite States, Republican and
emocratic. As President Eisenhower has said:
. unity among free nations is our only
hope for survival in the face of the worldwide
Soviet conspiracy backed by the weight of Soviet
military ower. This struggle dominates all
other conSIderations of our times. The issue, free-
dom versus communism, is a life and death matter.
To my mind it is the struggle of the ages.” 3 So
spoke our President.
You will say, and rightly, that Americans have
not always shown their belief in the interrelation-
shi and interdependence of nations. Our critics
ma e much of historical isolationism in the United
States. But this isolationism accorded with the
needs of the time and our capacities in the ﬁrst
centur of our inde endent existence. The Thir-
teen &)loni% whic joined to form the United
States were weak and, in those days, far removed
from the centers of world power. They were
