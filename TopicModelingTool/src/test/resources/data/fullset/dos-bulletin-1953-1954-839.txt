tus of the German authorities in the Soviet Zone
and you have once a ain re eated the Soviet pro-
osal, which has aﬁeady n rejected b my
vernment, for the establishment of “a1 -Ger-
man Committees”.
I must make it clear to you that my Govern-
ment still regards the Soviet Union as the power
responsible for the Soviet Zone of Germany. My
Government does not recognize the sovereignty
of the East German regime. In this connection,
I take the opportunity of drawin your attention
to the declaration made on AprifS by the High
Commissioners of the United Kingdom and
France and m self,” a co y of which I enclose.
You have a so repeate your charges about al-
leged criminal organizations which are said to
be located in West Berlin. These charges are,
as you have already been informed, without
foundation. Your letter of April 17 therefore,
since it introduces clearly unacceptable conditions
and unfounded accusations, does not make a pos-
itive contribution to the problem of removing the
restrictions on freedom of movement for the Ger-
man people, and serves only to accentuate the
present division of Germany.
So lon as this division exists it remains the
duty of t e four occupying powers to do every-
thing in their power to lessen the hardships re-
sulting from it. I do not intend to be diverted
from the constructive proposals I have already
made to you and remain ready to take all the
measures indicated in my letter of March 17. I
hope therefore that, in order that we may make
enuine progress in matters which are of real
1mportance to the German eople, you will accept
my proposals without furt er objections.
Czechoslovak Protest Concerning
Crusade for Freedom Rejected
Press release 277 dated May 24
Following is the text of a note to the Czecho-
slovak Government delivered on May 24 by the
American Embassy at Prague to the Mi'nist of
F oreign Affairs in reply to the latter’s note 0 ay
5, 195.4,6 concernin the release of balloom y the
Urusade for Free om:
The American Embassy presents its compli-
ments to the Czechoslovak Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and has the honor, upon instructions of
the U. S. Government, to refer to the Ministry’s
note of May 5, 1954, concerning the arrival of
balloons in Czechoslovakia.
The U. S. Government is informed that the
Crusade for Freedom Committee has sent mes-

sages to the people of Czechoslovakia by the ve-
hicle of balloons. The Crusade for Freedom, an
organization of private citizens, is supported by
millions of Americans and ex resses the aspira-
tions of the American people or the freedom of
all peoples. The messages, it has been learned,
transmitted news items and discussed concrete
goals in which the Czechoslovak people would be
interested.
The operation was undertaken by this private
organization and neither the U. S. Government
nor the U. S. authorities in Germany were in-
volved. The U. S. Government rejects the protest
of the Czechoslovak Government which is with-
out foundation.
As has been previously suggested, the United
States holds ﬁrmly to the view that there must
exist unobstructed communication between peo-
ples if nations are to live in peace and freedom
with one another. When a government violates
this principle by tryin to insulate its people from
the world of ideas wit out, it is only natural that
efforts will be made, both inside and outside that
country, to break through the insulation. The
choice of balloons as a means of communication in
the present instance indicates that the Czechoslo-
vak Government continues to deprive the Czecho-
slovak eople of the ossibilities of free contact
with ot er peoples, t e free exchange of ideas
and the free reception of uncensored news.
It is understandable that the American people
would seek by such means as are available to main-
tain contact with the ople of Czechoslovakia
with whom they had ormerly enjoyed free as-
sociation and with whom they share many com-
mon traditions and beliefs. The American people
take a profound interest in the welfare and future
of the people of Czechoslovakia. The leaﬂet-s
home to Czechoslovakia express the interest of
the American public in seeing the welfare of the
people there improved through the attainment of
a series of goals. Notwithstanding, the Czecho-
slovak Government claims that these leaﬂets were
subversive and inciting. It consequently appears
that in the eyes of the present regime in Czecho-
slovakia discussion of concrete steps to better the
lot of the common man in that country is sub-
versive in nature.
If the Czechoslovak Government desires that
this form of communication between peoples not
be utilized, it lies within its power to remove the
need for such media by opening the barrier to
free access to the people of Czechoslovakia. The
United States is convinced that free contact be-
tween peoples everywhere will contribute greatly
to support world peace in which the Government
of Czechoslovakia professes continuing interest.
The U. S. Government would have no basis for
interfering with attem ts by private American
organizations to establis communication with the
people of Czechoslovakia and to convey to them
the interest of the American people in their fate.
