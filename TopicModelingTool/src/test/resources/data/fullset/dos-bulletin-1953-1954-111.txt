12. It is also noted that in your reply of the
6th January 1954 you have further set out the
views of the UNO
(a) That the political conference has “no de-
termining relationship to the questions of POle
in NNRC custody”;
(b) That aragraph 11 of the terms of refer-
ence 2 preclu e your entering into any discussion
to consider further the disposition of the PO‘Vs;
(c) That the position as set out in (b) above
“was clearly indicated in the armistice negotia-
tions which resulted in the terms of reference for
the NNRC”; and
((1) That it is “the express responsibility of the
commission to release prisoners to civilian status”
on the 23rd January 1954 at 0001 hours.
13. The NNRC has received from the KPA
[Korean People’s Army] and Crv [Chinese
People’s Volunteers] command their answer.
They insist:
(a) That the explanation period should be ex-
tended and ex lanations resumed;
(b) That t e problem of the unrepatriated
prisoners should be referred to the political con-
erence; and
(c) That the Nxac and Cr: should continue
to exercise “their legitimate functions”.
14. The NNRC considers it necessa to state
its own position, based on the terms 0 reference
and its purposes, and its appreciation of the same
in regard to aforesaid afﬁrmations set out in para-
graph 12 herein:
(1) The anc is unable to agree that the polit-
ical conference has no determining relationship to
the question of the PO\Vs as stated in your reply.
The view of the commission is that the political
conference is an integral part of the pattern and
procedures laid down in paragra 1h 11. The elim-
ination or the non-emergence of an integral part
of the pattern cannot be regarded as inconsequen-
tial or having little or no effect on the rest of the
procedures or on the decisions in regard to the
status and disposition of the POWs that it is
the duty of the N NRC to make.
(2) The NNRC is unable to agree that the terms
of paragraph 11 preclude further discussion on
matters relevant to the pur oses of the agreement
between the two comman s. The Nuns has on
various occasions sou ht agreements with either
or both commands am? has not regarded such dis-
cussion with or between the commands for the
implementation of the terms of reference and its
purposes as being precluded. It will also be re-
called that the temporary agreement Annexure 2
of the armistice a cement is dated the 27th of
July 1953 after t e signature of the terms of
reference Annexure 1 on the 8th day of June 1953.
(3) The N NRC was not party to the armistice

’ BULLI-rrm of June 22, 1953, p. 867.
negotiations and has no knowled e of the indi-
cations made by the arties to eac other during
the negotiations to which you refer in your reply.
(4) The NNRC is unable to agree that it has the
express responsibility to release prisoners to civil-
ian status. The terms of reference do not provide
for such release. It is, however, rovided that
the commission shall “declare relief rom the POW
status to civilian status” subsequent to the imple-
mentation of certain procedures prescribed in the
terms of reference. These procedures however
have not been implemented, and in consequence,
the Nch is rendered lacking in capacity even to
“declare” such “relief”.
15. The N NRC has given deep and anxious con-
sideration to the problem of the status and dispo-
sition of the POWs in its custody in the situation
confronting it and come to the following decisions :
( 1) The NNRC has no competence to release
POWs; such an eventuality is not provided for, or
contemplated by the terms of reference;
(2) The ﬁnal disposition of POWs which alone
would include release is not assigned to the NNRC
by the terms of reference;
(3) The Nxac has no com etence at present to
“declare” “relief” from P0 status to civilian
status of the prisoners in its custody as the proce-
dures prescribed, preceding such declaration, have
not been im lemented.
(4) The 1 NRC has not been enabled to continue
custody beyond the 23rd of January 1954 or to
perform any functions to further the implementa-
tion of the terms of reference owing to lack of
agreement between the commands concerned.
16. In the li ht of the above decisions, I, as
Chairman and ,xecutive Agent of the commission
and having the custody of the POWs have come to
the conclusion that the only correct and lawful and
peaceful course open is to restore the prisoners to
the custody of the former and respective detaining
sides immediately prior to the 23rd of January
1954.
17. I therefore propose to request you to accept
the restoration of custody as on 20th of January
1954 at 0900 hours and ho e that this will be com-
pleted as speedily as possi le.
18. Restoration of custody will take lace on the
border of the southern sector of the Z and the
CFI perimeter and the POWs be accepted on your
side of the border according to established proce-
dures in regard to the transfer of POWs.
19. I as Chairman and Executive Agent of the
commission desire to state in the clearest manner
that in restoring the POWs to the custody of
former detaining sides, I am doing so because I
can neither retain custody of POWs nor further
implement the terms of reference nor release them.
I am not doing so to establish any alteration in
their status or to effect the ﬁnal disposition of
POWs.
