A Report on Educational Exchange Under the Fulbright Act in 1953 1
During 1953, about 7,000 persons were ex-
changed with 70 countries through exchange pro-
grams administered by the De artment 0 State
under the Fulbright Act, the mith-Mundt Act
and other acts of Congress. Participants in-
cluded students, educators, newsmen, industrial-
ists, specialists and leaders in other ﬁelds who are
inﬂuential in molding ublic opinion overseas.
Their visits have a sin I}; purpose—t0 contribute
to mutual understan ing between the United
States and other countries. More speciﬁcally, in
the light of the present world crisis, this purpose
is to bring about a greater world-wide under-
standing of, confidence in, and cooperation with
the Unlted States; to further the realization
among other peo les that the objectives and poli-
cies of the Unite States are in harmony with and
will advance their own legitimate aspirations for
peace, progress and freedom; and to create a
greater spirit of unity, hopefulness, and determi-
nation among free peoples.
The enactment of the Fulbright Act in 1946
made it ossible to extend the exchange program,
original y authorized for Latin America in 1938
as part of our Good Neighbor Policy, to certain
countries beyond the Western Hemis here. Con-
gress later provided, in the Smith- undt Act of
1948, the general framework for exchange activi-
ties on a world-wide basis. \Vithin this frame-
work, the Department conducts special programs
in Germany and Austria under an appropriation
for Government in Occupied Areas, and in Fin-
land and India under payments of those countries
that have been set aside by legislation for this
purpose.
The followin report is limited to the exchange
activities carrietgl out under the Fulbright Act, and
is submitted in accordance with Section 32 of the
Surplus Property Act of 1944, as amended August
1, 1946, by the Fulbright Act. Speciﬁcally, it
covers those activities authorized by paragraph
32 (b) (2) of the Fulbright Act which were car-

partment of State under Public Law 584 (House Doc. no.

ried out during the period January 1 through De-
cember 31, 1953.
Status of Executlve Agreement:
No executive agreements were signed in 1953.
Altogether, 28 executive agreements have been
signed since the act was assed in 1946. How-
ever, programs have since 11 suspended in three
countries—China (Formosa), Korea and Iran.
The exchange activities described in this report
were carried out under executive agreements with
the following 25 countries: Australia, Austria,
Belgium-Luxembourg, Burma, Ceylon, Denmark,
Egypt, Finland, France, German , Greece, India,
Iraq, Ital , Japan, the Netherlan s, New Zealand,
Norway, akistan, the Philippines, Sweden, Thai-
land, Turkey Union of South Africa and the
United King om.
The carrying out of executive agreements was
affected by the provisions of Section 1415 of Pub-
lic Law 547, 82nd Congress, the Rabaut Amend-
ment. The effect of this amendment is to require
the purchase in dollars, from the Treasury De-
partment, of all forei currencies used in the
program, thereby ma ing commitments under
executive a eements de endent on annual dollar
appro riations by the ongress. A request was
made or exempition of the program from the ro-
visions of the abaut Amendment. While n-
gress did not approve the exemption, it did pro-
vide for the carrying out of existing agreements,
as well as for the making of new agreements for
periods in excess of one year, subject to the avail-
ability of appropriations for this purpose (Section
1313 of the General Provisions of the Supple-
mental Ap ropriations Act of 1953, Public Law
207, 83rd (gongress).
The dwindling su ply of foreign currencies
available under the Fulbright Act threatens the
continuation of the program in a number of coun-
tries. For exam le, such currencies are no longer
available in Turkey and a similar situation is in
rospect in the immediate future in Egypt and
ndia. Altogether, exchange programs will ex-
pire in the following 8 countries by 1956 unless
additional foreign currencies become available:
Ceylon, Egypt, India, Iraq, Pakistan, Sweden,
Thailand and the Union of South Africa.
