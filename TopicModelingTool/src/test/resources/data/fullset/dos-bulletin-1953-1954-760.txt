and 2,000 Dutch relatives are in this group, which
includes parents, brothers, and sisters of American
citizens as well as sons and daughters of American
citizens who are not entitled to nonquota status,
being married or over 21 ears of age; and ﬁnally,
husbands, wives, and children of permanent resi-
dent aliens in the United States. The signiﬁcance
of the Refugee Relief Act in relation to this group
of aliens is that many of them, due to the note.
limitations of our regular immigration aws,
would have to anticipate a waiting period of many
years before they could come to this country while
under the Refugee Relief Act, within the numeri-
cal limits provided therein, they may come as soon
as they fulﬁll the requirements of the law.

Visas Issued in the Netherlands
Under Refugee Relief Act
Press release 256 dated May 14
The following information was received on May 14
from the American Embassy at The Hague:
Scott McLeod, Administrator of the Refugee
Relief Act, today presented to a family of eight the
ﬁrst Public Law 203 (the Refugee Relief Act) visas
issued in the Netherlands in a ceremony at the
Rotterdam U.S. Consulate. The immigrants, whose
departure date has not yet been set, are: Jan
Koetsier, 56, cattle breeder of Mijdrecht, Utrecht
Province; his wife, Christina, 55; their sons Jan,
Jr., 24, Tennis, 22; Gerard, 21; Jakob, 13; and
daughters Marrigje, 20, and Christina, 17.
The sponsor is Koetsier’s son Henry, 25, a dairy
owner who resides at Buena Park, Calif., who im-
migrated to the United States on October 31, 1947,
and was naturalized October 14, 1953.
The Koetsiers, who were on the regular quota
waiting list, applied for admission to the United
States under Public Law 203 on March 31, 1954.



The procedure to be followed in the case of these
Italian, Greek, and Dutch relatives differs mate-
rially from that followed in the case of refu ees
and escapees. Petition forms required for t ese
relatives under the regular immigration laws are
ﬁled and in man cases have been approved for
some time b the mmigration and Naturalization
Service of t e Department of Justice. The Serv-
ice veriﬁes the evidence of the relationship be-
tween the relative petitioner in this country and
the alien abroad and notiﬁes the Department of
State of its ﬁndings. The Department then an-
thorizes the American consular oﬂicer abroad to
grant preference quota status to the alien. In
addition, the relative in this country submits to
the consular ofﬁcer the usual evidence of support,
such as an affidavit of support or a contract for
employment. The assurances of em loyment,
housin ,, and against becoming a pub 10 charge
prescri ed for refugees and escapees are not re-
quired in connection with the immigration of these
relatives.
Italian and Greek relatives are expected to bene-
fit primarily from this rovision. It is worth
noting that s ouses and c ildren of brothers, sis-
ters, sons, an daughters of American citizens who
are not entitled to quota preferences under the
regular immigration laws are entitled to consid-
eration under the Refugee Relief Act, a signiﬁcant
effort to prevent the separation of families in
mi ation.
he third oup of immigrants who may beneﬁt
from the Reggee Relief Act are or hans. Four
thousand orphans in any part 0 the world,
adopted abroad or to be adopted in the United
States, by an American citizen and spouse may be
issued immigrant visas under the Refu ee Relief
Act. Proper caution is being exercise by those
administering the law to Ian for the immigration
of orphans in such way t at the needs of the child
are protected as much as the interests of the com-
munity and the State to which these children are
destined. I am glad to give reco ition at this
point to the ﬁne cooperation we in t e Department
of State have had in this connection not only from
the Children’s Bureau of the Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare but also the vari-
ous State and voluntary social agencies expert in
and concerned with the welfare of children.
In the case of o hans, assurances of proper
care have to be submitted by the American citizen
who has already adopted the child abroad or who
is planning to adopt the child in the United States.
Dltferent requirements are established depending
on whether the adoption has already taken lace
abroad or will be initiated in this country. n the
latter case, some of the requirements are an investi-
gation of the pros ective adoptive home and ar-
ents by a recognized child care agency an an
investigation in the country of the orphan’s resi-
dence by a qualiﬁed welfare agency concerning the
orphan’s mental and hysical health and family
background. It is a so required that arrange-
ments have been made with a child care agency
for the supervision of the orphan pending his legal
adoption and, in the event the adoption petition
is denied by the court, for the care and resettle-
ment of the orphan.
The fourth and last group of aliens beneﬁting
from the Refu ee Relief Act are 5,000 nonimmi-
grants in the nited States who entered this coun-
try before July 1, 1953, and who may be granted
ermanent residence status if they can show that
because of events which have occurred subsequent
to their entry to the United States they are unable
to return to the country of their birth, nationality,
or last residence because of persecution or fear of
persecution on account of race, religion, or politi-
cal opinion.
When Congress passed the Refugee Relief Act
it decided that it should be administered by the
established operating agencies of the government
under the supervisory jurisdiction of the Adminis-
trator of the Bureau of Security and Consular
