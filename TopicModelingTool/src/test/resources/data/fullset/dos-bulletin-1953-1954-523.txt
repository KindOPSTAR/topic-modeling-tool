Economic Cooperation Between the U.S. Government
and the Countries of the Near East
by Stephen P. Dorsey
There is a lon history of economic cooperation
with the Near ast on the part of American pri-
vate enterprise. Yankee traders went to the
Levant in the early days of the new republic. The
ﬁrst American technical expert might be said to
be Eli Smith, a missionary from Northford,
C0nn., who took the printing press to Syria in
1834. Ex-Confederate technicians contributed
their skills to the development of the area after
the end of the Civil War. These were all private
ventures—forerunners of the business ﬁrms and
the philanthropic, religious, welfare, educational,
and cultural organizations whose interests today
ﬁgure rominently in Middle East affairs.
The KU.S. Government, on the other hand, al-
though it has lent diplomatic support to such
ventures since before the signing of the U.S.
Treaty of Amity and Commerce with Muscat in
1833, did not become directly involved from a
ﬁnancial point of view in economic or technical
rojects in the area until the Second World \Var.
t was then that limited lend-lease aid was ex-
tended to several Near Eastern countries on a
cash-reimbursable basis and it was just after the
war that Export-Import Bank loans and surplus
war property credits were extended to certain
others. In 1947 the Greek-Turkish aid policy
was announced; in the case of Turkey the aid
was largely militar at ﬁrst, but later it became
part of the Marsha 1 plan with greater emphasis
on economic develo ment. In January 1949 tech-
nical assistance, un er Government as well as pri-
vate auspices, was announced as the fourth point
of the President’s inaugural address, although it
was another year and a half before the ﬁrst of
the hundreds of technical experts ﬁnanced by the
U.S. Government reached the Near East.
Durin this post-war period Congress also
appropriated funds to various U.N. agencies
which are active in the area today, the United
Nations Relief and Works A ency for Palestine
Refu ees ($153 million to ate) ' the Interna-
tionaI Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(which has made loans to two Near Eastern coun-
tries, Turkey and Iraq, and which will shortly
send an advisory mission to Syria) ; and a number
of other U.N. agencies—Wor (1 Health Organiza-
tion, Food and Agriculture Organization, U.N.
Children’s Fund, International Civil Aviation Or-
ganization, U.N. Technical Assistance Adminis-
tration, and International Labor Organization.
Finally, last summer Congress amended the Mu-
tual Security Act to provide for “special economic
assistance” over and above technical assistance in
the exact sense of the term.
Thus in the space of 10 years the U.S. Govern-
ment has undertaken substantial, although not
massive, economic cooperation in the Near East.
As Secretary Dulles remarked when he returned
from the area last June: 1
The peoples of the Near East and Asia demand better
standards of living, and the day is past when their aspira-
tions can be ignored. The task is one primarily for the
governments and the peoples themselves. In some cases
they can use their available resources, such as oil revenues,
to better advantage. There are, however, ways in which
the United States can usefully help, not with masses of
money but by contributing advanced technical knowledge
about transport, communication, fertilization, and use
of water for irrigation. Mr. Stassen and I feel that
money wisely spent for this area under the mutual se-
curity program will give the American people a good re-
turn in terms of better understanding and cooperation.
Turkey
Any discussion of American economic coo era-
tion with the Near East might well be intro uced
by a summary of our relationship with Turkey
for here economic cooperation has embraced all
of the types to be discussed later, with the signiﬁ-
cant exception of refugee aid. And in Turkey we
see an outstandin example of economic and social
progress in a trou led area—a stalwart member of
the free world community.
