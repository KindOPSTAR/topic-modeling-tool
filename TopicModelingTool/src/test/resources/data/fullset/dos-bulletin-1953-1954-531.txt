nomic recovery to military defense, European in-
dustrial production had increased by more than
50 percent and was above the prewar level. Agri-
cultural production had increased by 12 percent
and inter-European trade b approximately 75
percent. Even with a eat y increased popula-
tion and with many orei investments lost,
European living standards ad returned almost
to the prewar level.
On the military side, there has also been sub-
stantial progress. Since NATO be an in 1949, more
than a million men have been ad ed to the armed
forces of the European NATO forces. What is
more important, these forces have been or anized,
trained, and given large quantities of e m ment.
In 1949, there were fewer than 15 organize divi-
sions available in Western Europe, and one NATO
military ex ert said that “all the Russians need to
march to t e Atlantic are shoes.” Today they
need a lot more than that. NATO ground forces
in Europe and the Mediterranean area number
more than 80 divisions. Air forces and naval
forces have also increased substantiall . The
NATo countries have also joined together in build-
ing common bases and other facilities for common
use by the NATO forces. More than 120 new air
bases for exam 1e, are now ready for use, as com-
ared with 15 bases which were capable of han-
lin jet aircraft in 1951.
T e progress in the buildup of NATO defenses
has been made possible largely through American
military assistance. As of December 1953, the
United States had delivered worldwide more than
30,000 tanks and combat vehicles, more than 30,000
artillery pieces, more than 5,000 aircraft, more
than 600 naval vessels, more than 175,000 trans-
port vehicles, and over 1% million small arms and
machineguns, as well as many other items. Ap-
proximately 75 percent of this equipment has one
to its NATO allies. At the same time, it is we 1 to
remember that the European governments have
by no means depended solely on United States
assistance. Their own defense expenditures have
increased 2% times and their military production
has quadrupled. For every dollar’s worth of mili-
tary assmtance which we have granted since 1949,
the European governments have spent approxi-
mately $3 for defense from their own budgets.
While many European governments continue to
be relatively unstable, at least by American stand-
ards, democratic institutions are considerably
stronger than they were at the end of World War
II. In most European countries, Communist
voting strength and other Communist inﬂuences
have steadily declined. Communist paramilitary
forces have been disbanded, and it is now believed
that no Communist Party is in a position to over-
throw any free European government by force.
Meanwhile, the rise of democratic institutions and
a democratic spirit in Austria and Germany con-
stitutes one of the most striking achievements of
the postwar period.
Progress Toward Unlty
Europe’s progress toward internal unit has not
been as rapid as we Americans would li {e to see.
At the same time, it must be recognized that more
progress toward unit has been made since the
end of World War I than in the preceding 500
years. I have already mentioned the formation
of the OEEC. The 0220 members also created a
European Payments Union ’ to reduce payments
difﬁculties among the OEEC countries arising from
their separate currencies. Most of the OEEC coun-
tries are also members of the Council of Europe,’
where legislative leaders come together to discuss
common problems.
More striking, however, has been a development
toward unity among six nations which have ac-
tuall undertaken to transfer a part of their na-
tiona sovereignty to supranational institutions.
France, German , Italy, and the three Benelux
countries have ormed the European Coal and
Steel Community,a under which the former 'uris-
diction of national governments over coal an steel
production and distribution has been transferred
to an overall Euro ean body. These same six
countries have signed a treaty to establish a Euro-
pean Defense Communit , within which their na-
tional defense systems will be merged in a common
army with common uniforms, a common rocure-
ment system, and a common budget. ending
ratiﬁcation of this treaty, these nations have also
begun work on a draft treaty designed to establish
a uropean political community.
As I said earlier, the old-fashioned balance of
ower in Euro e cannot be restored, but the grow-
ing strength 0 Western Europe is makin possible
a new power relationship which, with merican
power added on the scales, may be able to prevent
war for the indeﬁnite future.
N o summary of the progress of postwar Europe
would be complete wit out reference to two things
which have not happened. First, there has been
no new war in that area, despite dire predictions
a few years ago that war was inevitable. Second,
the Communists have not gained any new territory
in the European area since the Marshall plan ot
under way in 1948. The march of communism as
been halted, and it has been halted without setting
off World War III.
Future Problems
Despite the pro ss which has been made, I do
not want to leave t e impression that all our prob-
lems have been solved. In fact, as we look to the
future, we can foresee problems which will tax our
ingenuity to the utmost. Let me brieﬂy describe
some of these.
First, everyone agrees that we still need to attain
far greater defensive power than now exists.
