and has established pockets out ahead of the
front in many areas. It has also had signal re-
verses. It overreached itself in Korea and was
thrust back at heavy costs to the Koreans and
to us but at even heavier costs to itself. Its bids
for control in Formosa and most of Southeast
Asia. have so far been frustrated—in some cases,
(,dramatically.
Far Eastern policy has been a subject of par-
ticular partisan conﬂict in the Umted States.
However, I believe it is so no lon er. I believe
our country is now retty general y of one mind
in its appraisal of t e situation in the Far East
and its meaning for us. We recognize that the
Communists are convinced that in the long run
it must be we or they, the free world or their
world. It matters very little whether we believe
mutual toleration and coexistence to be possible
if they are dedicated to the proposition that they
are not. We recognize that, havin been frus-
trated in Euro b the success of t e Marshall
plan and the girth Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion, the Communists have been giving major
attention to the Asian world, where the situation
has offered them distinct advantages. Broadly
speaking, these advantages are twofold.
0n the phfysical side there is the Communists’
ssession o the great base of operations oﬂ'ered
y mainland China, to which the rest of Asia is
geographically peripheral. Just as the osition
ussia achieved in Manchuria at the end 0 \Vorld
War II gave the Communists an invaluable base
for operations against China proper, so the pos-
session of mainland China gives them an invalu-
able base for operations against the rest of Asia.
In addition, it has given them an army of per-
haps 2% million men and exposed the Chinese
minorities in Southeast Asia to Communist pene-
tration and intimidation. These minorities num-
ber between 10 and 12 million and play an
important role in the economic life of the coun-
tries in which they live.
On the psychological side, Asia has oﬁered the
Communists the opportunities that an absolutist,
ruthless. highly disciplined, self-sure movement
always ﬁnds in a situation of widespread disorder,
insecurity. doubt, confusion, discontent, and suf-
fering. But the greatest psychological advantage
the Communists have reaped arises from the fact
that the Asians had traditionally looked upon
Western Europe as the outstanding obstacle in
the way of their revolution. It was European
domination and European privilege that in the
eyes of the Asians blocked the avenues of advance
to a more rewarding and self-respecting future.
By contrast, the Communists were in their eyes
fellow-revolutionaries and allies in the struggle
with Western imperialism. It has been asking
a great deal of the Asians to expect that they
would be able, in the short period since \Vorld
\Var II, to see the lVest as an ally of their revolu-
tion and Communist imperialism as the outstand-
\

ing threat to their new independence. Perhaps
the remarkable thing is not that many Asians
have been unable to readjust almost overnight
to the radically altered circumstances of the
present but that so many have done so.
Communlst Alma In Asia
The Communists, although absolutely ﬁxed in
their thinking with respect to ultimate objectives,
are notorious improvisers in strategy and tactics.
A discumion of Communist blue r' ts of action
is therefore generally fruitless. e are prob-
ably justiﬁed in surmising, however, that what
the Communists are now aiming at is to utilize
their assets in China to gain control of Southeast
Asia with its strate '0 resources and its rice sur-
pluses on which a an depends. They would
then dominate Japan 5 natural trading area, com-
prising the former “Greater East Asian Co-l’ros-
perity Sphere,” and be able to dictate the terms
on which the Japanese could make a livelihood./
Completing the consolidation of their control over
the whole Asian world, with its manpower, re-
sources, and industry, they would be able to turn
upon the Middle East and Europe with t
strength and formidable prestige. This latter
element—the factor of psychological momen-
tum—is one that we should never underestimate.
Success, as Hamlet said of appetite, grows with
what it feeds on, and resistance which could stand
off 10 or 20 or 100 divisions may crumble before
a name.
Faced with these ugly facts. we have become
increasingly aware that Asia must be held against
the pressures of all kinds the Communists are
bringing to bear against it. At the same time it
has also become increasingly apparent that “hold-
ing” Asia is nothing that the Western Powers
can hope to do—not the British not the French,
not we ourselves, alone or all together. The
quickest way to turn Asia over to the Communists
would be for the Western Powers to act as if
they were moving in on Asia once more or trying
to cut themselves a slice of Asia. These, I believe,
are both gangster terms, and it is in such terms
that Asia would regard any attempt on our part
to “hold” them.
It is only the Asians who can hold Asia. It
does not, however, detract from the force of that
statement if we go on to recognize, as we have
recognized, that the Asians need our help. This
help we have been giving and are continuing to
ve.
glFirst we have been helping with the military
defense of Asia. Our major assistance has gone
to those countries under the most pressing threat.
We have contributed ve substantially to build-
ing up effective militaryrfbrces in the Republic of
Korea. Formosa, and in Indochina. In our view,
those forces serve to defend not only those three
areas but the whole of free Asia. The presence
