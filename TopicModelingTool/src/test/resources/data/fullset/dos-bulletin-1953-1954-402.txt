spoke of ending future colonization by any Euro-
pean power, but he spoke with greater emphasis
and at eater length of the danger which would
come ifgf‘the Allied Powers should extend their
political system to any portion of either continent”
of this hemisphere.
What he said was being said in similar terms by
other great American patriots and defenders of
human liberty. Those sentiments have lon sinm
ceased to be merely unilateral. The have come
an accepted principle of this hemisp ere. That is
why, it. seems to us, we would be false to our past
unless we a ain proclaimed that the extension to
this hemisp ere of alien despotism would be a
danger to us all, which we unitedly oppose.
The Price of Freedom
My Government is well aware of the fact that
there are few problems more difﬁcult, few tasks
more odious, than that of effectively exposing and
thwarting the danger of international communism.
As we have pointed out, that danger cloaks itself
behind ﬁne-sounding words; it uses the cover of
many well-intentioned persons, and it so weaves
itself into the fabric of community life that great
courage and skill are required to sever the on]
from the d. The $10 an of “nonintervention”
can plau31 1 be invok and twisted to give im-
munity to w at. is, in fact, ﬂagrant intervention.
The fact, however, that the defense of freedom
is difﬁcult, and calls for courage, is no adequate
excuse for shutting our eyes to the fact that free-
dom is in fact endangered.
Freedom is never reserved for long except by
vigilance and with edicated effort. Those who
do not have the will to defend liberty, soon lose it.
Danger to liberty constantly recurs in ever-
changing form. To meet that danger requires
ﬂexibilit and imagination. Each of our nations
has in tie ast had to take some difﬁcult and
dangerous ecisions, of one kind or another, on
behalf of the independence and integrity of this
hemisphere. During the 19th century, morethan
one American nation, including in own, risked
the hazard of war against great mi its powers,
rather than permit the intrusion into t is 1161111-
sphere of the a gressive forces of Euro an mi-
rialism. During this 20th century, w en evil
orces of militarism and fascism twice sought
world domination, the United States paid a great
rice in blood and treasure which served us all.
Each of our American Republics has contributed
to what has now become a glorious tradition.
Today we face a new peril that is in many re-
spects greater than any of,the perils of the past.
It. takes an unaccustomed form. It is backed by
resources greater than have ever been accumulated
under a single despotic will. However, we need
not fear, because we too have greater assets. We
have greater solidarity and greater trust born out
of our past fraternal association. But just as the
danger assumes an unconventional form, so our
response may also need to be different in its form.
We need not, however, solve all these matters
here. What we do need to do is to iden‘t‘igy the
peril; to develop the will to meet it uni y, if
ever united action should be required; and mean-
while to give strong moral support to those gov-
ernments which have the responsibility of expos-
ing and eradicating within their borders the
danger which is represented by alien intrigue and
treachery.
Of course, words alone will not sufﬁce. But
words can be meaningful. They can help to forge
a ter determination to assure our collective
in ependence, so that each of our nations will, in
whatever way that is truly its own, be the master
of its destiny. Thus, we will have served our
common cause against its enemies.
It is in that spirit and in that hope that the
United States presents its resolution.
STATEMENT OF MARCH 11
Press release 180 dated March 12
The U.S. delegation has listened with close at-
tention to the important observations which other
dele tions have made with reference to inter-
vention of international communism in the Amer-
ican Republics.
I have been impressed by the spirit of solidarity
and unity. One’s faith in our inter-American
association cannot but be strengthened by this
experience. It is a new chapter in practical co-
operation for a common purpose.
There has been, it seems to me, an extraordinary
degree of unanimit as to basic objective and
means. I am conﬁ ent that this unity of view
will be incorporated in the document we approve.
There appears to be general acceptance of two
basic propositions, i. e., (1) that international
communism, which our American Republics have
twice denounced with unanimity, is still a dan r
to hemispheric integrity, and, (2) that it is im-
portant for us at this time solemnl to warn
the authors of this threat to keep t eir hands
off this hemisphere.
The U.S. proposal for giving eﬁect to these two
principles has been generally accepted. How-
ever, certain amendments have been proposed or
suggested.
The United States has given ve careful con-
sideration to these amendments an I should like
to express, at this time, my views concerning them.
The concern most often expressed is that our
declaration might be interpreted as intervention,
or justifyin intervention, in the genuinely domes~
tic affairs 0? an American State. This concern is,
we believe, due to natural historical fears rather
than to any language in the U.S. proposal.
As several of m colleagues have pointed out, in
view of the speci c purpose and scope of the pro-
