dignity and personal respect between the Arab
and Jewish eoples which did exist prior to the
outbreak of ostilities. It is recognized that this
cannot be done by legislation or force. The United
States, as an interested party, should do all within
its power to accomplish this end. One certain
way in which this can be accomplished is to state
our objectives clearly and to show our intention to
be impartial and consistent.
(5) To give positive moral assurance to the
arties that we will accept our share of responsi-
bility, together with the other members of the
United Nations, only on the condition that any
and all agreements made will be kept in good
faith.
It is felt that the opportunity exists now for a
more substantial beginning to solve the refugee
problem. However, it must not be half-hearted
and indecisive, and it must be geared to obj ectivit
and good will for all of the governments involve
and with ﬁrm assurance that we are not motivated
by selﬁsh considerations.
It is clear that economic assistance alone is not
capable of winning the respect and affection of
these eoples and that, therefore, we and the
United) Nations must move with decision and de-
termination in all our relationships with these
governments in dealing with this problem.
