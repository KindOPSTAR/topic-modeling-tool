States Government has said before and will repeat
again that it will not use any kind of a weapon
except to repel aggression; that the United States
will not threaten to employ these weapons or use
them in any other manner inconsistent with our
obligations under the U.N. Charter. These are
pledges far greater than those which the U.S.S.R.
seeks to obtain from us for both propaganda and
strategic pur oses.
I have emp asized articularly in my statement
two of what I conceive to be the four principal
approaches used by the U.S. in trying to obtain
this objective of peace with freedom and security.
They are all part of the whole, and the use of the
processes of peaceful settlement and the attempts
to alleviate international social and economic ills
are also of eat importance.
I would ike to close with one reference which
would indicate to you why I have placed such em-
ighasis upon collective security and disarmament.
r. Lloyd V. Berkner, a distinguished physicist,
recently wrote: “I have heard it said that the only
be e of avoiding destruction to our civilized
va ues now lies in negotiation. This is probably
true. But negotiation can be effective only when
we negotiate from strength.” One of the major
objectives of this Government is to negotiate from
strength. It is for this among other reasons that
we pursue the four courses of action which I have
described. lVe have sometimes been accused of
seeking strength rather than negotiation. In fact,
the United States is seeking both strength—our
own and that of the free nations—and negotiation.
This dual eﬂ’ort has received the ﬁrm support of
most members of the United Nations. I believe
our record will demonstrate clearly that we have
sought to negotiate settlements of the major in-
ternational issues, and I am sure that my recital
of the initiative taken by the United States in the
disarmament ﬁeld is good testimony to the
patience and persistence of these efforts. We shall
continue these efforts. I only hope that some day
we may be successful.
Building Strength In Today’s
World Power Sltuation
by Deputy Under Secretary Murphy‘
Perhaps today more than ever in American his-
tory the impact of our foreign relations is felt
more directly by those like yourselves whose good
fortune it is to he graduated from American uni-
versities. But of course you know that the power
of a great nation is inextricably bound up with its

responsibilities. The world into which this grad-
uating class enters is profoundly different from
that which received your elders and receding
generations of Americans. Just as t 9 power
situation of our country has undergone change, so
the world of today is different in the tempo of
events, in the development of scientiﬁc techniques,
in its social characteristics and its conﬂictin
ideologies. In the healthy environment of For -
ham you are blessed by acceptance of a code of
mora ity which has become alien to large masses
of the world opulation for whom the state and
not the indiv1dual is of capital importance.
I suppose a pessimist would bemoan the fortune
which has been our lot in emerging from the ti-
tanic battles of World War II, victorious over the
totalitarian ideolo ies of nazism and fascism,
only to collide hea long, after barel a month of
respite, with the worldwide crusa e of yet an-
other agan philosophy, Soviet communism. But
it rea 1y is a challenge out of which will come a
better understanding of human values and a ﬁrm
belief in our religious principles. Communism
long since rejected that code of morals which on
have learned to revere here at Fordham and e se-
where. At times, in dealing with the exponents
of the other system, it has seemed to some of us
that we are at a disadvantage. For them the
conception of political action in good faith, of
truth, of conﬁdence, and of trust are the out~
moded concepts of a despised bourgeoisie. But
I believe that the disadvanta e is more apparent
than real, and now the prob cm is more clearly
understood by an ever growing number in the free
world. At least the da has passed when we heard
so often that the troub e was that the Soviets did
not understand us well enough and that we had to
make substantial concessions at every turn to er-
suade them of our good faith. It seems bar to
believe today that such a theory was widespread
on the part of many Americans 10 years ago. In-
credible as it now seems, those were the days
when it was considered a diplomatic victory to
induce a Soviet representative merel to attend an
international meeting. But that is t e way it was.
Cf course, as our Secretary of State recently
sald, if one does not believe in a spiritual order, if
one does not accept the fact of moral law and
what the Virginia Bill of Rights referred to as
“the duty which we owe to our Creator,” then it is
indeed difﬁcult to combat the thesis that men
should be the servants of the state. And that one
state should be the master over all other states.
As Secretary Dulles has wisely said, if it be ac-
cepted as a premise that man is merely matter,
then it 18 easy to conclude, as the Communists do,
that the greatest harmony and greatest productiv-
1ty come from organizing a soclety of conformity,
where diversity is treated as grit in the gears of
a delicate machine. If all people act only as di-
rected and think only as directed and believe only
as directed, then, it is argued, there will be none
