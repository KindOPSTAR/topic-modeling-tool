U.S. Not To Slgn Tln Agreement
Preao reIcaoe 115 dated March 5
The State Department on March 5 informed
the other overnments particularly interested in
tin of the ecision of the U.S. Government to hold
off the market excess tin stocks it holds and ex-
pects to acquire and also announced the decision
of the United States not to sign the International
Tin Agreement drawn up at Geneva in December
1953.‘ It made clear that the United States did
not obiect if other countries decided to bring the
agreement into force. The United States is not
a tin-producing country.
In announcing its decision not to sign the agree-
ment, the United States made clear that it was
aware of the importance attached to the agree-
ment by other governments. Since the agreement
can come into force and can be operated without
U. S. participation, the State Department said it
did not anticipate that the United States decision
would prevent the agreement from becoming effec-
tive and made clear that the United States would
not object if other governments decided that this
was in their interest.
The Department explained that under the de-
cision not to dispose of the excess tin stocks held
or to be tlﬂ uired b the U.S. Government these
stocks woul be he] in insulation. Withdrawals
could be made only at the direction of the Presi-
dent, as in the case of regular stockpile materials.

Polloy on Wool Imports
Statement by the Prcxillcnt
White House press re1eau dated March 4
On July 9, 1953, on the advice of the Secretary
of A riculture, I requested the United States
Tari Commission to make an investigation, under
Section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, to
determine the effect of imports of certain varieties
of sheep’s wool on the operation of the domestic
price-su )port program for wool.‘
I now rave t ie report ' of the Tariﬁ Commission,
in which a majority of its members recommend the
im ition of certain fees on imports of wool in
ad ition to the prevailing duties.
At the same time as the Tariff Commission in-
luiry was initiated, I requested the Secretary of
grlculture to make a comprehensive study 0 the
domestic factors which have contributed to the
decline in sheep numbers and wool roduction in
the United States, with a view towar the develop-
ment of a sound and tprosperous domestic wool in-
dustry consistent wi an expanding internutiomrl
trade.J
On the basis of this study, which was carefully
analyzed and discussed b ' the interested agencies
of the executive branch, determined that domes-
tic wool growers required continued price or in-
come assistance in a more effective form than is
now provided. I accepted the principal recom-
mendations of the Secretary of Agriculture, which
provide for government assistance to growers
under an incentive payment plan durin periods
lwheln wool prices are below the desire support
eve .
These recommendations have been submitted to
the Congress. Hearings have been held before
the Senate Committee on Agriculture and For-
estry and a bill embodying these recommendations
has been approved by that Committee. The en-
actment of this program by the Congress would
eliminate the necessity for an increase in import
fees or other limitations on wool imports, a course
of action which I do not believe would best serve
either the wool-growing industry or the national
