because of its ossible bearing on the Suez ques-
tion; Chile will) resent it if we send synthetic ni-
trates under our aid program in Greece; and we
have to be constantly thinking of the effects of
our aid programs on the normal commerce of
friendly nations who may feel that we are musclin
in to their markets—not to mention the efforts 0
other nations to muscle in on ours. And if we
seek any measure which helps production in
friendly foreign countries but may adversely af-
fect domestic interests—if we make any conces-
sion to Venezuelan oil Chilean copper, Mexican
lead, Peruvian zinc, Cu an su ar, Argentine wool,
Urugua an meat—we know t at we are likely to
face a omestic storm, even though it is demon-
strably a fact that prosperity in our sister re-
publics promotes our own prosperity. Time and
a ain a problem has many interloc ing features

overlook even one may be disastrous.
Diplomatic roblems might also be simpler if
they were of t e here today and gone tomorrow
type, like the ordinary headache. Unhappily
t ey seldom are. Nations may quickly forget the
wrong they have done others, but they never
for et the wrongs others have done them. Every
diplomatic recommendation must be made in the
light of those which receded it; it must also take
into account those w ich may ﬂow from it. De-
cisions made, an imprudent act committed, rece-
dents established, an indiscretion publishe even
decades ago may arise today to plague the di 10-
mat. Impatient citizens may inquire: “Why
didn’t you do that? Why be so namby-pambyt
Why don’t you tell some of these foreign slickers
off?” They forget that every decision tends to
point inexorably the path to the next; once
started on a given path there is often no turning.
A diplomat must not be bemused by the osies
which adorn the path as he starts down 1t; he
must foresee what ma confront him after a few
windings. You would, probably say that the J a -
anese decision to attack Pearl Harbor was ma e
in the fall of 1941, but I would answer, “No, it was
made in the fall of 1931.” From the moment of
the wanton attack on Mukden there was no turn-
ing back. Diplomatic decisions, and equally diplo-
matic indecisions, may plague a nation’s foreign
olicf7 for generations. hey should not be
ight y made.
Diplomats often do not have a choice between
good and bad decisions. Many diplomatic de-
cisions must be between what is bad and what is
worse—indeed, in many cases between what is
bad and what is unthinkable. If a diplomat has
to make a bad decision rather than a worse one,
and those who are hurt by it criticize its undeni-
able faults, the diplomat is obviously a sitting
duck, even if he has tried to choose the least had
course and to make it as palatable as possible to
everyone. If in blasting the diplomat the critics
completely contradict each other, it only makes
their criticisms the more effective, because every-
one agrees the diplomat was wron .
Since to get a vital agreement from a friendly
nation a d1plomat must generally make conces-
sions, it gives all who care to criticize a chance
to say that he has sacriﬁced the national interest
to the foreign. No matter how hard he may
try, no matter how much ood will he ma bring
to his task, he will inevitaﬁly run into di culties.
A policy, a line of action in international affairs,
however much it may suit the national interest,
cannot be exclusively followed. Sooner or later
vital domestic interests or the well-founded claims
of another friendly nation will cut across a course
with the highest priority. We cannot satisfy
even those we most want to satisfy and a great
power has manyl it wishes to satisfy. It is the
unhappy fact t at problems arise 1n geometric
proportion to power and interests, and we today
ave more of each than any nation on earth.
leltatlons on Our Power To Act
\Ve must, moreover, appreciate the limitations
on our power to act 1n 1nternat10nal affairs. In
our own country we are sovereign, and if we see
,a situation which needs to be remedied we have
the power to remedy it. We do not have that power
in other countries. We may realize that in a given
country the government is weak, inept, or venal;
that social conditions are bad; that the ﬁnances
are hopelessly mismanaged; that the authorities
are arbitrary or brutal; that justice is maladmin-
istered or minorities are oppressed, and yet there
may be little we can do a at it. We must not,
we should not, we cannot run their affairs. Only
rarely can a overnment appeal to a foreign nation
over the head of its government, despite no lack of
trying. The usual effect of foreign interference
is to make a bad situation worse, to strengthen in
its vices and its hold on the people the very govern-
ment one wishes to reform. Logic and self-interest
weigh little in a situation like this; within the
past few cars we have seen several instances of
nations ca mly repared to commit national suicide
rather than ieIld to the reasonable views of other
countries. ur policies at best can remedy con-
ditions in foreign countries but little, even if these
conditions strongly affect our interests.
In many diplomatic questions one is dealing
primarily in imponderables—in rivalries, sus-
picions, 'ealousies, sensitivities, piques. And in
most pro lems many of the facts are undetermin-
able. There is often no wa of knowing recisely
what the eople you are dea ing with are t inking,
or what t eir real objectives are. One can guess,
but one cannot know, what their reaction will be
to a given course of action. A diplomat must not
only e skilled in his estimates of the true posi-
tion of other governments with which he is deal-
ing; he must also foresee the probable course of
events and other possible ones. He must seek to
