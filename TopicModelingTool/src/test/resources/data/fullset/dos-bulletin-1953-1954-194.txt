fare, even, if practicable, as a member of their
own forces, and of course a bargainpég asset in
seciirin the return of their own ca tu soldiers.
LegaI conﬂicts inevitably arise rom such con-
ﬂictiii attitudes. They have been brought
sharpli' into focus by the Geneva conference in
1949, by efforts of the General Assembly of the
United Nations to assist in effecting the repatria-
tion from the Soviet Union of \Vorld War II
prisoners of war, and by the Korean conflict.
At Geneva in 1949, some 60 odd States includ-
ing Soviet Russia negotiated and signed a new
convention for the Protection of Prisoners of War.
This convention represented a number of advances
over The Hague conventions of 1899 and 1907 and
the Geneva convention of 1929. For example, ar-
ticle 10 provides that “When prisoners of war do
not beneﬁt or cease to beneﬁt, no matter for what
reason, by the activities of a Protecting Power,”
or of an im )artial international organization, “the
Detaining ower shall request a neutral state,
or such an organization, to undertake the func-
tions performed under the present convention by
a Protecting Power designated by the Parties to
a conflict.” The Soviet bloc fought against this
principle of neutral observation and protection of
the prisoner of war’s rights and made formal reser-
vations to this article.
A second advance in the Geneva convention is
contained in article 85. It provides simply that
“Prisoners of war prosecuted under the laws of
the Detaining Power for acts committed prior to
capture shall retain, even if convicted, the bene-
ﬁts of the present Convention.” The Soviet bloc
reservations to article 85 appear to be premised on
the assumption that a prisoner convicted of a war
crime is removed from the protection of the con-
vention. Combined with trial by farce and ab-
sence of neutral observation, the reservation is
calculated to permit the Communist state to deny
the beneﬁts of the convention at will.
Article 118 of the Geneva convention restates
the obligation of release and repatriation deriv-
ing from The Hague conventions of 1899 and
1907. It reads, in part:
“Prisoners of war shall be released and re-
patriated without delay after the cessation of
active hostilities.”
The great advance in 1949 was to provide that
prisoners were to be released at the end of active
hostilities instead of at the conclusion of peace.
Recent experiences have demonstrated that the end
of active hostilities may precede the conclusion of
peace by a long time, sometimes years.
It was not until 1950 that the Soviet Union was
challenged in the General Assembly for failure to
repatriate or account for prisoners of war of
World War II. Its defense was not to deny the
obligation, but to deny the facts and to assert that
all living prisoners of war had been returned. Ir,
also sought to ex lain the disappearance of an in-
determinate num r on the ground that they had
been convicted of war crimes. Eﬁ'orts of the
General Assembl to induce the Soviet Union to
live u to its obli tions have been unsuccessful,~
thoug i small num rs of prisoners have been re-
leased from time to time.
The evidence of mistreatment of prisoners b
the Communists in Korea is appalling. But this
created no legal issue. The question of repatria-
tion did.
Both sides in the Korean conﬂict early stated
their intention of adhering to the principles of the
1949 Geneva convention, although the United
States, Communist China, and Russia have not
ratiﬁed it. But when the armistice negotiations,
were undertaken, the Communists inSisted that
captured Communist prisoners must be repatri-
ated, by force if necessary, while the United Na-.
tions Command insisted that a prisoner who did
not want to return would not be forced to do so,_
but had the right to seek as lum. The provision
of the Geneva convention that prisoners were to.
be released and re atriated was cited by the Soviet
delegation to the nited Nations as authority for
the roposition that prisoners must be re striated;-
by fldrce if necessary. The obligation, yshinsky
asserted, was unconditional.
In the course of the debate before the United
Nations, the United States contended that the.
legislative history of the Geneva convention estab-
lished that the option of a detaining ower to.
extend asylum to a prisoner of war, whic existed'
in general international law, was not intended to
be cut off by article 118. By an overwhelming-
majority the General Assembly adopted a resolu-
tion recommending that the issue be resolved by
an agreement not to force prisoners to return.
This principle was incorporated into the Korean
Armistice Agreement. This provides for impartial
international supervision of prisoners and recog-
nizes the right of a prisoner of war to refuse repa-
triation. Forcible repatriation, as demanded by
the Communists, was ﬂatly rejected.
It is, of course, too early to appraise the ﬁnal.
outcome. Much hangs in the balance in Korea~
today. But one thing is clear. The State asset,
theory of human values applied to prisoners of
war, so vigorously presented by Vyshinsky in the
General Assembly in 1952, has been overwhelm-.
ingly rejected by the non-Communist world, and
the humanitarian principles of the Geneva con-.
vention have been upheld.
These are a few of the recent developments in
international law which affect the United States.
Progress in this ﬁeld of the law, as in most, is
slow—sometimes discouragineg slow. However,
progress is being made, and will continue, in our
constant search for a body of law which will serve
the ends of peace and security in the world.
