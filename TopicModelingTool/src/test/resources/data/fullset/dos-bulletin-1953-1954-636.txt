lished on a stable and durable basis, this particu-
lar ministerial meeting will be conﬁned to an ex-
change of views between the foreign ministers with
reference to the worldwide political situation as
affecting the NATO members.
In reparation for this meetin" I reviewed with
Presi ent Eisenhower the United States estimate
of the world situation and the ersistence in vary-
ing forms of the menace of oviet communism
which makes it imperative that there be collective
measures to meet that menace.
The President expressed his cat personal sat-
isfaction that NATO, as it comp etes its ﬁfth year,
has already made a large contribution to peace and
faces the future with a prospect of growing
strength and unity.
I leave for Geneva conﬁdent that the Western
Allies are closer than ever before to a unity of pur-
pose with respect to world problems, not only of
the West, but of the East.
Secretary Dulles Leaves
for Paris and Geneva
Statement by the Secretary
Press release 207 dated April 20
I am leavin for Paris where there is a meeting
of the NATO ouncil on Friday [April 23]. On
Saturday I shall go on to Geneva for the confer-
ence on Korea and Indochina. This conference
has been called pursuant to the Berlin a cement
of the Foreign Ministers of the Unite States,
France, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet
Union.‘
It is important to bear in mind what this Geneva
Conference is and what it is not.
The ﬁrst stated subject of the conference is “the
establishmen by peaceful means, of a united and
independent orea.” Twent nations have been
invited to meet at Geneva to eal with this topic.2
The other subject to be discussed is the “problem
of restoring peace in Indochina.” So far there
has been no determination of the interested states
which will be invited for this phase of the confer-
ence.
That is what the Geneva Conference is. There
are some thin s it is not. It is not a “Big Five”
Conference. he Soviet Union tried to make it
that, but gave way before the combined opposition
of France, Great Britain, and the United States.
The conference is not to discuss international
problems generally. This was sought by the So-
viet Union. But that concept was rejected in the
‘ BULLETIN of Mar. 1. 1954, p. 317.
'Ibid., Mar. 8, 1954, p. 347.
face of the opposition of the three lVestern
Powers.
The conference does not imply our diplomatic
recognition of Communist China. On the con-
trary, the Berlin agreement expressly sti ulated
that neither the invitation to nor the ho] ing of
the conference should imply di lomatic recogni-
tion where it is not already accor ed. This proviso
on which the United States stood absolute v ﬁrm
was accepted reluctantly by the Soviet Union
during the closing minutes of the Berlin
conference.
There is some evidence that the Soviet Union
may attempt to make the Geneva Conference some-
thing other than what had been agreed upon at
Berlin.
The United States believes that the foundation
for an relaxation of international tensions is a
scrupu ous observance of international agree-
ments. lVe shall ex ct the Berlin agreement to
be complied with bot by the Soviet Union, which
was one of the parties to the agreement, and by
the other Communist regimes which come to
Geneva pursuant to an invitation to meet on the
terms set out in that agreement.
The United States is going to this Geneva Con-
ference determined to seek in good faith the estab-
lishment of a genuinely united and inde endent
Korea. We also accept the view that, i Korea
can be made united and independent by peaceful
means, this will make it easier to restore in Indo-
china a peace which has been broken by Commu-
nist armed ag ression. lVe shall strive to achieve
that peace on onorable terms consistent with the
independence of Viet-Nam, Laos, and Cambodia—
States which are now threatened.
Ever since the Berlin agreement to seek peace
in Indochina, the Communist, forces have stepped
up the intensity and scope of their aggressmn.
They have expended their manpower in reckless
assaults apparently designed to improve their
bargaining position at Geneva. It is tragic that
war should be used and the lives of so many tens
of thousands should be sacriﬁced as an instrument
of political policy.
This is not a good prelude to Geneva. Never-
theless, we shall not be discouraged nor shall we
grow weary in our search for peace.
