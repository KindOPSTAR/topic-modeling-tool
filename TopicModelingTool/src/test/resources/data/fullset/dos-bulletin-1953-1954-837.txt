by the two Governments under date of March 9, 1944
resulted and exhaustive studies of the Columbia River
Basin were made by the International Columbia River
Engineering Board.
c. On November 1, 1050, the International Columbia
River Engineering Board submitted to your Commission
a report entitled: “Interim Report on Kooteiiay River".
The report contained the following recommendation:
“In view of the foregoing and of the reference directive
the Board recommends that the normal forebay eleva-
tion of 2,450 feet above mean sea level be approved for
the Libby project . . ."
d. The reservoir would be approximately 95 miles
long and from one-half to one and one-half miles wide.
It would extend 42 miles into Canada approximately to
the Bull River dam site, which is about 5 miles upstream
from Wardner, British Columbia. With a full Libby
reservoir the depth of water at the international boundary
would be 150 feet. The reservoir will occupy approxi-
mately 47,800 acres, of which 17,600 acres are in Canada.
In the Canadian portion, the reservoir would ﬂood a few
small communities and farms, and some secondary roads.
In addition, it would necessitate the raising of the Cana-
dian Paciﬁc Railway Crows Nest line and No. 3 highway
for short distances. The reservoir would have a gross
storage capacity of 5,985,000 acre-feet, of which approxi-
mately 1,000,000 acre-feet would be in Canada. The
usable storage capacity at 50 percent druwdown (172
feel) would be 5,010,000 acre-feet, of which 1,000,000
acre-feet would be in Canada.
e. The Dam as currently planned would be a straight
concrete gravity structure rising about 410 feet above
bed rock. It would be about 2,700 feet long at the top
and 1,200 feet long at the base. The head provided for
hydroelectric development at the site would be 344 feet
at normal full pool elevation. An overﬂow spillway in
line with the existing river channel, equipped with gates,
would have a capacity of 280,000 cubic feet per second.
For ﬂood control operation of the dam a sufﬁcient number
of sluices would be provided to permit. when combined
with the flow through three of the powerhouse units, a
total release of 60,000 cubic feet per second when the
power pool is fully drawn down.
1'. The powerhouse would be located at the down-
stream toe of the dam near the left abutment. The initial
installation would consist of six generating units rated
at 100,000 kilowatts each, or a total of 600,000 kilowatts.
The ultimate installation would consist of eight such
units, or a total installation of 800,000 kilowatts.
L'. The estimated cost of construction is $263,321,000
of which approximately $7,020,000 is the estimated cost
of providing the portion of the reservoir in Canada, and
approximately $256,301,000 is the cost of the dam and the
portion of the reservoir in the United States.
b. The project would provide much needed ﬂood con-
trol and power beneﬁts in both Canada and the United
States.
5. Accordingly, the Government of the United States
asks that the International Joint Commission approve the
construction of the Libby Dam and the proposed method
of operation of the dam and reservoir to elevation 2,459
feet above mean sea level. It is requested that the Com-
mission, in accordance with Article VIII of the Treaty
of January 11, 1909, make its order of approval con-
ditional upon suitable and adequate provision being made
for the protection and indemnity of all interests on the
Canadian side of the boundary which may be injured
thereby in accordance with the practice of the Commis-
sion in similar cases in which it has approved applications
of this character.
6. This communication will, it is believed, he found
by the Commission to contain all essential averments
regarding the facts upon which this application is based
and the nature of the order of approval desired, and to
be in conformity with the provisions of Paragraph (a)
of Rule 6 and with Rule 7 of the Commission’s Rules of
Procedure.
7. In submitting this application to the Commission,
the hope is expressed, on behalf of the United States.
that in view of the importance of the matters involved,
the Commission will expedite its consideration thereof
and its action thereon in order that the project works
and the plan of operation thereof may receive the approval
of the Commission with the least possible delay.
8. Attached to Annex A of this application and made
a part thereof are the maps and drawings showing the
situation and extent of the project works.
The required additional copies of the application are
being forwarded to you under separate cover.
Very truly yours,
JOHN Foerm DULLEB

[Translation]
I acknowledge receipt of your re ly of March
17 to my letter of March 6,‘ in whic i it was pro-
posed by me that measures be taken in the very
near future by means of a cement between cor-
responding German authorities of East and West
Germany to create two all-German committees:
One for economic and administrative matters, and
the other for cultural matters. I deem it neces-
sary to draw your attention to the fact that the
all-German committees mentioned in my letter
could examine and decide uestions of interrela-
tionships between East an West Germany, in-
cluding problems of passenger and freight traiiic
