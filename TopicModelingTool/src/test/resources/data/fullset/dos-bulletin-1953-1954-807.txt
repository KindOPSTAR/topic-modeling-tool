Trade Wlthln the Free World
Toward the close of the 6-month period under
review, the President’s Commission on Foreign
Economic Policy (Randall Commission) was hard
at work. There was a great amount of public
discussion, continuing into 1954, concerning wa s
in which the United States and other free-wor d
countries could eliminate or reduce the obstacles
that hinder the international exchange of goods.
The Commission, issuing its report in J anuar ,
had much to say on the reduction of trade og-
stacles.a
The Commission also included a section on East-
West trade, recommending that the United States
not object to more trade in peaceful goods between
Western Europe and the European bloc.
These two subjects, trade liberalization and
East-West trade, are connected with each other.
When businessmen in free-world countries are
hindered—either by trade barriers or other arti-
ﬁcial causes—from selling products in other free-
world countries, they are more prone to seek mar-
kets in the Soviet bloc.
To a certain extent this aggravates the problem
of maintaining adequate strategic trade controls
and the problem that some free-world countries
have of avoiding undue dependence on the Soviet
bloc.
It would be im ractical to seek the elimination
of all trade restrictions within the free world but
it is important to reduce unjustiﬁable barriers and
it is also important to take whatever other steps
are possible to develop new markets and new
sources of supply.
To bring alternative markets and supplies into
being is not an overnight task but it must be done.
It means the reduction of many restrictions in the
United States, thus allowing more goods to come
in from our friends and allies. It means a similar
loosening of restrictions by other free nations. It
means more and better economic integration
among the European countries. It means steady
advancement in the economic development of the
underdeveloped areas of the world.
All those things are important for many rea-
sons. East-West trade is one aspect of the matter.
The United States Government recognizes that

The China Trade Falls OH
This report so far has concerned itself almost
entirely with trade between the free world and
the Soviet bloc in Europe. Now it is time to shift
our attention to the China trade.
During the 6 months under review, free-world
trade w1th Communist China fell far below the
ﬁrst half of the ear. Free-world ex orts to Com-
munist China gram July through ecember are
estimated to have been $111.1 million, as com-
ared with $158.9 million in the ﬁrst half of 1953.
his meant that shipments in the report-period
fell below even the extremely low level of the ﬁrst
half of 1952.
The result of this decline in shipments to Com-
munist China was that the estimated total for all
of 1953 was $270 million, only a sli ht rise in value
from the 1952 exports of $256.5 mi lion.‘ A larger
rise had been foreseen. The last Battle Act report
to Congress, Worldwide Enforcement of Strategic
Trade Controls, pointed out: “If free-world ex-
ports continued at the same rate as that of the ﬁrst
3 or 4 months of the ear—and that is not at all
certain—the 1953 tota would be around $375 mil-
lion.” It actually seems to have been about $100
million short of that.
Free-world imports from Communist China also
dropped in the second half of 1953, though not so
sharply as experts. They amounted to $198.4 mil-
lion m the second half, according to a preliminary
estimate, compared with $226.6 million in the ﬁrst
half of the year. This brought the estimated an-
nual total of imports to $425 million in 1953, as
compared with $365.8 million in 1952.
It was true that in spite of the decline in the
latter part of the year some countries were able
to sell more goods to the Chinese Communists in
1953 than the had in 1952. For example, exports
of Western ermany rose from $2.8 million in
1952 to $25 million in 1953, in line with the general
rebirth of German forei trade. Exports of
France rose from $3.3 million to $12.4 million, and
Japan from half a million dollars to $4.5 million.
Exports from the United Kingdom rose from $12.8
million to $17.5 million. On the other hand ex-
ports from the British Colony of Hong Kong, the
traditional gateway of commerce to and from the
mainland of China, fell so drastically in the second
half of 1953 that the Hong Kong total for all of
‘These 1952 and 1953 ﬁgures are adjusted to exclude
Swiss watches, which appear in Swiss oﬂicial statistics as
exports to China, but which actually went to the British
Crown Colony of Hong Kong and were reexported to other
free—world countries. Switzerland, in reporting its
“China” trade, lumps together its trade with Communist
China, Nationalist China, and Hong Kong. The watches
in question are believed to amount to approximately $1
million a month, on the average. [Footnote in the
