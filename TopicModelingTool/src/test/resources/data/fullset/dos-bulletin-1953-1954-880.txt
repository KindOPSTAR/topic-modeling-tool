destructive and wasteful expenditure, there is now
a program for relief and rehabilitation of the
Republic of Korea. This in art is being con-
ducted by the United Nations, ut the main part
is a United States effort.
It is an immense task to restore domestic well-
being in war-ravaged Korea. However, the cost
represents only a small fraction of what would be
the cost of waging war. We believe that the ac-
complishment of this eaceful task will be in the
interest of the United tates and of the free world
if it shows, as we know it can, the capacity of free
men to excel in the arts of peace.
The Government of Japan is now planning to
assume a larger share of responsibility for its own
defense. On May 1, 1954, a Mutual Defense As-
sistance Agreement between the United States and
Japan came into eﬁ'ect.‘ Within the last few da s
the Japanese Diet has enacted legislation esta -
lishing a new national defense agency and author-
izing an increase in the present size of the national
safety forces. Under the Mutual Defense Assist-
ance Agreement, the United States is planning
military end-item assistance to Japanese defense
forces. While this will create an item of cost for
the United States. it is a cost which will have
compensating beneﬁts.
The situation in Indochina is fraught with dan-
ger, not only to the immediate area but to the
security of the United States and its allies in the
Paciﬁc area. The area is one which is vital to the
peace and safety of the United States.
Communist China has been supplying to the
Viet Minh an everincreasing volume of munitions
and military supplies. There is also evidence that
Soviet arms have been supplied in increasing
quantities to the Communist force in Indochina.
In their classic manner, the Communists have
sought to capitalize on local aspirations for in-
dependence and have used these aspirations to
gain control of a movement which was primarily
nationalistic in its ince tion. The rulers of Com-
munist China train an equip in China the troops
of their puppet Ho Chi-Minh. They supply these
troops with large amounts of artillery and ammu-
nition made in Soviet-bloc countries. They sup-
ply military and technical guidance in the staff
section of Ho Chi-Minh’s Command, at the divi-
sion level, and specialized units such as the sig-
nal and engineering corps, artillery units, and
transportation.
The plan is not only to take over Indochina but
to dominate all of Southeast Asia. The struggle
thus carries a grave threat not only to Viet-Nam,
Laos, and Cambodia, but also to such friendly
neighboring countries as Thailand, 7 Malaya,

Burma, Indonesia, the Philippines, Australia, and
New Zealand.
The United States Government has been alive
to the growing peril. We have encouraged the
French in taking steps toward the granting of
full independence to Viet-Nam, Laos, and Cambo-
dia. We have provided a great part of the mil-
itary materiel needed by the French Union forces
and the national armies of Cambodia, Laos, and
Viet-N am. 'We have agreed to ﬁnance most of
the cost of the ﬁght to maintain the freedom of the
Associated States. Particularl we have sought
to help in equippin and maintalning an increased
number of nationa forces.
In the Mutual Security Program for 1955 ro-
vision is made for continuing such su port. I ith
the many uncertainties that lie ahea , it is essen-
tial that there be adequate ﬂexibility in the use
of funds appro riated so that necessar expendi-
tures can be ma e to accomplish in Sout east Asia
and the Western Paciﬁc the policies and purposes
declared in the Mutual Security Act.
You are all aware that the French and their
Viet-Nam ally have suffered reverses, notabl the
fall of Dien-Bien-Phu, after a superb de ense.
The resent situation is grave, but by no means
hope ess.
In the present conference at Geneva, we and
other free nations are seekin a formula by which
the ﬁghting can be ended and the peo 1e of Indo-
china assured true independence. 0 far, the
Communist attitude is not encouraging. It is im-
possible to predict what the future holds.
The uncertainties of the future in the Far East,
like the exigencies of the world situation elsewhere,
indicate the essential need for ﬂexibility in the
use of the funds authorized and a propriated in
this program. If we are to be ab e to make the
most effective use of what we have, the President
must be in a position to move quickly and de-
cisively to do what will, under the circumstances,
best serve the ends which the act is desi ed to
promote. For this reason we believe t at the
ﬂexibility provided in this legislation in the past
should be continued.
I should like to refer brieﬂy to the administra-
tion of this pro ram. I sald last year that I
thought it could be best administered by another
agency outside the Department of State. I know
that the uestion of the roper agency for admin-
istering t e rogram has een a matter of consider-
able discuss1on in the Congress—as it has in the
executive branch. I think I should tell you that
I am well satisﬁed with the manner in which the
present arrangements have worked out and recom-
mend their continuation for the next ﬁscal year.
In conclusion, let me look for a moment at this
Mutual Security Program in its larger meaning.
The present world situation demands, as a ﬁrst
priority, the maintenance of unity and cooperation
among the non-Communist nations. Not one of
us alone could face with assurance an all-out strug-
