the ﬁrst authorization of U.S. Government grant
aid to the Arab States and Iran for somethin
more than technical assistance, that is, for capita
development and other purposes. Turkey had
received such funds through participation in the
Marshall plan, as had Israel for “relief and re-
settlement projects” for “refugees coming into
Israel” more than half Israel’s population).
There ha been grants to UNRWA for Palestine ref-
ugees (one-ﬁftieth the population of the Arab
States), but there had been no grant aid as such to
the Arab States, nor to Iran.
Section 206 authorized the expenditure of $147
million in special economic aid for the Near East
and Africa. The discussion leading to its pas-
sage emphasized the administration’s desire for a
more regional approach to the economic and social
problems of the area, greater ﬂexibility with re-
spect to the appropriation of funds in accord-
ance with existln conditions at the time of com-
mitment, and the need for accelerating the
economic development of this strategic area, ar-
ticularly through river and transport develop-
ment. Such acceleration could not be accom-
plished under the long-range, low-cost technical
assistance program alone.
In authorizing the appro riation of these funds
the Congress demonstrate its faith in the im-
portance of healthy cooperation in the economic
development of the area. At the time of the hear-
ings and voting, illustrative projects were pre-
sented, but blueprinted projects were not at hand,
and riority could not be assigned to situations
which had not yet developed or to degrees of eco-
nomic cooperatlon which could be expected. There
were only tentative apportionments of the funds,
but, for the ﬁrst time, the U.S. Government was
able to say to the Arab States, Iran and Israel
(which was no longer to be granted money for the
relief of refugees but rather from the new regional
package), “\Ve have a fund from which we are
ready to assist your country if you can come
forward with sound projects on which funds can
be committed in this ﬁscal year to our mutual
advantage.”
An early charge on the newly established sec-
tion 206 account was for Iran and amounted to
$23.4 million.‘ It was made available after the
Shah had returned to Iran and General Fazlollah
Zahedi had become Prime Minister to support the
budget and consequently strengthen the new gov-
ernment which this government considered more
favorably inclined toward U.S. and Western ob-
jectives than was the Mossadegh government
which had tried to oust the Shah.
A second use of special economic aid funds was
also for an emergency, though the amount in-
volved was much smaller—$250,000—to ﬁnance
the transportation costs of American wheat
shipped to Akaba under the Famine Relief Act,
‘IMd., Sept. 14, 1953, p. 349.
following President Eisenhower’s determination
that it would ease conditions caused by drought in
southern Jordan.
A third emergency use of section 206 funds
was for Israel, to which a (5-month allocation of
$26 million was announced last October. The
funds will be used largely for the purchase of
foodstuffs, fodder, seeds, fertilizer fuel, and raw
materials for the manufacture of clothing and
footwear. It is hoped that this grant will assist
Israel in further progress toward a self-sustaining
economy.
that will the Government do with the remain-
ing balance in the 5 remaining months of the cur-
rent ﬁscal year? It is hoped that all of it may be
committed by June 30 for expenditure on sound
economic development projects based on thorough
blue rints and Signed agreements. That is what
the .S. Government 1s aiming for. In some
cases, plans are developed quite far—certainly
more fully than ever in the past. In other cases,
the materials essential to negotiations have been
delayed. In any case, a number of worthwhile
projects have been submitted which are now under
intensive stud for qualiﬁcation for American aid.
If mutually a vantageous arrangements cannot be
worked out and it cannot be demonstrated that the
money will contribute signiﬁcantl to a solution
of Near Eastern problems, fun s will not be
committed.
Aid to Palestine Refugees
Our economic cooperation directed toward solu-
tion of the problems of the 870,000 unfortunate
Palestine refu ees is accomplished through
UNRWA. This ody has an Advisory Commis-
sion originally composed of representatives of
the U.S., U.K., France, and Tur ey. Now, as a
result of action taken during the ast year it in-
cludes representatives of Syria, ordan, Egypt,
and Lebanon. The U.S. Government has appro-
priated $153 million for the assistance of the refu-
gees since 1948. Of this, $43 million was for relief
and the balance (not all of it spent) was for re-
integration. This represents approximately 65
percent of all contributions up to the present.
The Uniﬁed Plan for the Development of the
Jordan Valley lately has received Widespread at—
tention. Emphasis here will rather be on other
reintegration projects for the refugees, drawin on
the recent Interim Re ort to Congress of the pe-
cial Near East Re 11 ee Survey Commisslon
headed by Governor Edwin L. Mechem of New
Mexico.5 The report states that: “The biggest
problem faced b UNRWA in the implementation
of this program as been to ﬁnd practicable proj-
ects at reasonable cost in countries where the refu-
gees are presently located, which are politically
acceptable to the governments concerned.”
