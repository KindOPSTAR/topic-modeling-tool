The Principal Tasks of Diplomacy
At a memorial meeting in Tel Avila on January
8, Francis H. Russell, U.S. Chargé d’Affaircs, de-
livered an address in tribute to Monnett Davis,
Ambassador to Israel and former Director General
of the Foreign Service, who died on. December 26.
In the course of his talk, Mr. Russell made the
following observations on American diplomacy:
Last year there appeared in the United States
one of the best books ever written in my country
on diplomacy. In it one of America’s foremost
writers on foreign policy said this:
In a sense that is true In no such degree In other
nations, American diplomatic action has been determined
by the people. There were ardent debates on foreign
policy In the ﬁrst days of our national history. There
have been such debates ever since. The democratic tra-
dition is deeply rooted In our history. The men who
stand at the levers of control are almost always men with
substantial political experience. Their habits, their pre-
possesslons, their convictions all lead them to pay heed
to the voice of the great body of citizens, to shape their
decisions with that voice In mind. . . . The general senti-
ment of the people lies at the root of every great issue.
I read that to you because, at the time Monnett
Davis assumed the direction of the American
Foreign Service, one of the greatest revolutions
in American public opinion had just taken lace.
During the two decades before World War I the
American public had been predominantly isola-
tionist. It had refused to accept the responsibili-
ties of membership in the League of Nations.
Candor requires us to say that it failed to see the
importance to the United States of what ha pened
elsewhere in the world and to recognize 818 im-
portance of developments in America to many
other countries and peoples.
In the course of “'orld War II that sentiment
changed. It changed to the extent that during
and after the war, according to public opinion
polls, 92 percent of the American public favored
America’s participation in an international or-
ganization designed to resist aggression, to lessen
tensions, to promote economic progress throughout
world, freed from the menace that now threatens.
You, in the Jaycecs. bear a responsibility in
helping make unity a fact. To the extent that
you share on a broader scale those experiences you
lave learned at home will we be able to achieve
a unity of free nations.
President Eisenhower laid down the challenge
in these words:
“lVe must never fear the future. For this—the
future—is the hope and home of all who are young
and are free, if only they are brave.”
the world, and to brin about an improved order-
ing of international re ations.
Coincidentally there was another development,
of equal signiﬁcance in the challenge which it pre-
sented to American diplomacy. It became ap-
parent that the free way of life, the roduct of
the previous 3,000 years of human en eavor and
struggle, was threatened by the emergence of the
monolithic society in its various forms and the de-
termination on the part of its adherents to impose
its pattern upon as large an area of the world as
possible b any means available to it] including
the use 0 force. It was apparent tiat, if the
pluralistic approach to organized human exist-
ence—if the struggle to create a society which
strives to make possible for every individual the
inward happiness that comes from growth and
pro ress toward valid goals—if this age-long,
wor dwide rogress built upon experience, upon
a growing owledge of the nature of man, and
upon religious insights—if this was to continue,
a vast cooperative effort on the part of all free
people would be necessary.
T ese two developments created a challenge to
the American Foreign Service of an unparalleled
nature. The old concepts of diplomacy—its ob-
'ectives and its methods—were no longer adequate.
ecause of the political and economic stature of
the United States and its military potential in the
event of necessity, it was obvious that this great
effort to preserve the free pattern of life could
succeed only if America recognized the responsi-
bilities of leadershi and, having recognized them,
exercised them wi skill, with imagination, and
with restraint, an awareness, as President Eisen~
hower said last month,1 that the easiest thing to
do with great power is to abuse it.
This posed problems in the solution of which it
was necessary for diplomacy to play a leading role:
Such problems as how to evolve a pattern for a
justly ordered world, but a world in which each
