gle with the Communist empire. Its rulers now
old in servitude 800 million eople, and they
have harnessed these people and the great mate-
rial resources of their lands to a triple threat of
war, subversion, and propaganda which consti-
tutes the most formidable menace that free peoples
have ever had to face. Fortunately, the free world
capacity for instantaneous retaliation helps to
neutralize the Soviet threat of mass destruction.
Nevertheless, the need for unity among free
peoples in developing additional resistance and
eterrents to Communist expansion is increasingly
evident.
Unity requires mutual respect and forbearance
on the part of all of the free nations. There is a
natural impatience in each free country with the
inhibitions and limitations of collective action.
In some countries, there are those who protest that
the cooperation of their governments in this com-
mon cause means subjugation to alien inﬂuence
and who argue that they should prove their inde-
pendence by practicin neutralism. Some in this
country feel that the nited States would do better
if it sought to cast off the world-wide military and
economic burdens and political anxieties which
history has thrust upon us.
But such a course would merely play the Soviet
game. The destruction of free world unity is the
principal goal of Soviet strate
plomacy, their propaganda, their pressures, and
their inducements have this aim.
This United States Mutual Security Program is
one of the ways to revent the success of Soviet
strategy. It helps indispensably to maintain a
unity which is vital to our own security. Without
that unity, the United States would quickly be
forced to become a garrison state and the stran-
gling noose of communism would be drawn ever
tighter about us.
Moreover, the Mutual Security Program per-
mits the free world to develop more total strength
than we could possibly develop by spending the
same amount of money in this country. Let us
never forget that our allies are spending three
dollars for defense purposes for every dollar that
we give them. The safety of this country no
longer depends merely upon our own armed forces,
important as they are, but upon the combined
military power and political and economic sta-
bility of the free world as a whole. For this
reason, I can say with complete assurance that
every dollar in this Mutual Security Program is
designed to protect and advance the security and
well-being of the United States itself. I urge,
therefore, that this program be given your prompt
and sympathetic consideration.
