each other better we can beneﬁt more and more in
nonmaterial as well as material ways. It has be-
come a cliché to say that the West can learn as
much from the East as the East from the West, but
it is worth repeating nevertheless.
But what gives us the most hope for the future
of our relations with India is the fact that there is
no basic difference inherent in our res ective
philosophies of government. India has reimbued
the spirit of democracy with the strength of her
own. She has given, in the life of Gan hi, it new
rallying point to all those who believe in the dig-
nity of each individual.
Both nations believe in freedom, in the individ-
ual, in his rights as an individual—in the commit-
ment of democratic government to protect those
ri hts. Our concept of democracy is the same.
TEe necessity for (protecting that democracy is
mutually recognize . The way is open to friendly
cooperation in efforts to build a better, more peace-
ful world.
Looking at the broad picture of our relations,
there is much more to cheer than to despair about.
So long as we do not succumb to the doubtful
luxury of carping and exasperation, the future is
a bright one.
We have, I believe, many areas of supreme im-
portance in which India and the United States are
in agreement. The chief task is to build upon
those areas and to strengthen them.
We do not expect to agree on every issue. There
are bound to be differences of opinion between two
democratic states, but the basic principles exist on
which we agree.
Let me repeat what I have already said: What
the Government of the United States wants above
all is a free, independent, and democratic India.
If it is an India w ich also a ees with the Ameri-
can outlook on internationa affairs, so much the
better. We shall certainly work hard to reconcile
our respective points of view, but it is the freedom,
the in ependence, and the democracy of India
that we consider essential and that we shall strive
to support to the best of our ability.
FOA Projects To Aid India
River Development Project
The United States will contribute $11 million
toward the construction of a new major river-
development projec the Rihand Dam, in the
north ndian state 0 Uttar Pradesh.
The Foreign Operations Administration on
April 2 reported the si 'ng in New Delhi of an
ment calling for su port to the pro'ect,
w ich will cost an estimat $70 million. he
Indian Government will contribute the equivalent
of $59 million to the construction costs.
Expected to be completed in 12 ears, Rihand
Dam would have an initial insta led electrical
capacity of 120,000 kilowatts and ultimate in-
stalled capacity of twice that much. A lar block
of the power will be utilized, according to t e plan,
for pumping water from possibly 4,000 feet deep
irri tion wells irrigating from a million to a
mil ion and a half acres of land. In addition,
water from the 180 square mile reservoir would
irrigate 400,000 to 500,000 acres.
The area to be served by the Rihand project has
a population of about 25 million persons and is
extremely undeveloped in both agriculture and
industry. Development of such basic industries
as manufacture of cement, chemical fertilizers,
aluminum, porcelain, and a er, for which abun-
dant raw materials are avai a le in the area, awaits
a power source such as Rihand would supply.
Establishment of Training Centers
Two training centers to instruct Indian parse -
nel in the operation and maintenance 0 heavy
earth-moving and construction equipment will be
set up in India as part of the technical coo ration
program, the Foreign Operations Administration
announced on March 24.
The training centers will be established in con-
junction with multipurpose river development
projects at Chambal and Hirakud. The training
course will run about 12 months and each center
will be designed to train at least 40 operators and
mechanics a ear.
The Uni States is contributing $460,000 to
the program and the Indian Government Will con-
tribute 1,402,000 rupees (equivalent to about
$294,420). Foa will also supply technicians to
take part in the instruction.
Locust bontrol
The Foa announced on March 18 that India’s
age-old ﬁght a inst swarms of desert locusts will
be sup rted y additional mobile equipment
ﬁnance under the U. S. technical cooperation
pro am.
xtending a 1952 locust-control agreement be-
tween the United States and India, Foe agreed to
ﬁnance the purchase of $80,000 worth of addi-
tional equipment and India agreed to make a con-
tribution of 460,000 rupees (equivalent to about
$96,600) to the program. During the last 2 ears,
the United States contributed $451,000 and ndia
the equivalent of $156,000 to the locust control
pro am.
T e control program, which was inaugurated in
1951 when the Middle East and South Asia were
threatened by a severe locust plague, has been very
successful in reducing damage. In 1953 the
damage from locusts was insigniﬁcant because of
the successful cooperation of the governments of
the countries threatened by locusts, agencies of the
