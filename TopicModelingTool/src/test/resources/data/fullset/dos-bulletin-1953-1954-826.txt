Ethiopia might very well have returned to her
policy of isolation.
Ethiopia 1! New Frontier
In consequence, in many respects, and particu-
larly since the last World War, Ethiopia has be-
come a new frontier of widely expanding oppor-
tunities, notwithstanding the tremendous setback
which we suffered in the unprovoked invasion of
our country 19 years ago and the long years of
unaided struggle against an inﬁnitely stronger
enemy. The last 7 years have seen the uadru-
pling of our foreign trade, currency, and oreign-
exchange holdings. Holdings of American dol-
lars have increased 10 times over. The Ethio ian
dollar has become the only United States do lar-
based currency in the Middle East today. The
assets of our national bank of issue have increased
1,000 ercent. Blessed with what is perha s the
most ertile soil in Africa, well-watered, an with
a wide variety of climates ranging from the tem-
perate on_the plateau, to the tropical in the val-
eys, Ethiopia can grow throughout the year
crops, normally raised onl in widely separated
areas of the earth’s sur ace. Since the war,
Ethiopia has become the granary of the Middle
East, as well as the only exporter of meat, cereals,
and vegetables. Whereas at the end of the war,
every educational facility had been destroyed, to-
day, schools are s ringing up throughout the land,
the enrollment as uadru led and, as in the
pioneer days_in the nited tates, and indeed, I
presume, as in the lives of many of the distin-
guished Members of Congress here present, school-
children,_in their zeal for education, take all sorts
of work in order to earn money to purchase text-
books and to pursue their education.
Finally, through the return in 1952 of its historic
ports on the Red Sea and of the long-lost territory
of Eritrea, Ethiopia has not only regained access
to the sea, but has been one of the few states in
the postwar world to have regained lost territory
pursuant to postwar treaties and in application of
peaceful methods.
We have thus become a land of expanding op-
portunities where the American pioneering spirit,
in_ enuity and technical abilities have been and
W1 1 continue to be welcomed.
A thousand year old history of struggles to de-
fend the territorial integrity of our country, the
long ﬁght for liberation two decades ago and the
recent campaign in Korea have given our arm
an esprit de corps and a ﬁghting spirit that,
believe, can stand, without misgiving, for com-
arison. Today, our ﬁghtin forces are among the
argest and best trained in t ie Middle East.
The strug le for liberation served to strengthen
the forces 0 national consciousness and unity and
since that time we have made signiﬁcant advances
in social progress. Unlike many other countries,
Ethiopia has long been a nation of small, rather
than of large, landowners. Moreover, a pro-
foundly democratic tradition has assured in the
past, as it assures today, the rise to the highest
posts of responsibility in the Government, of men
of the humblest of origins.
It is but natural, therefore, that a state which
has existed for 3,000 years, which has regained
its independence by the blood of its atriots, which
commands the allegiance and loya ty of even its
most lowly subjects, and which enjoys an unusually
sound economy, should have a regime of marked
stability on that area of the world where stability
is so frequently absent today.
Posltlon In World Polltlcs
Such is the state of Ethiopia today about which
I am speakin . It is against this background that
I wish to tal to you of Ethio ia as a factor in
world politics. Her geogra hic ocation is of great
signiﬁcance, with her lon s ore line and its archi-
pelago of hundreds of islands. Ethiopia occu-
ies a unique position on the most constricted but
important of strategic lines of communications in
the world, that which passes through the Red Sea.
She also lies on the other most strategic line of
communication in the world, namely, the world
band of telecommunications which, because of nat-
ural phenomena, circles the world at the Equator.
However, in yet a erhaps broader sense is Ethi—
opia’s geographica position of signiﬁcance.
Through her location on the shores of the Red Sea
and in the horn of East Africa, Ethiopia has pro-
found historical ties with the rest of the Middle
East as well as with Africa. In this respect she
stands in a completely unique position. Her cul-
ture and social structure were founded in the
mingling of her original culture and civilization
with the Hamitic and Semitic migrations into
Africa from the Arabian Peninsula, and, in fact,
today, our language, Amharic, is a member of that
large family of Hamitic and Semitic tongues and,
therefore, intimately related to Hebrew and
Arabic. Indeed, at one time Ethiopia extended to
both sides of the Red Sea as well as north to upper
Egypt. It was, therefore, not without reason that,
during the Middle Ages the Emperor was known
as “he who maintains order between the Christians
and the Moslems.” A profound comprehension of
and sympath with the other states of the Middle
East naturally inspires Ethiopian national poli-
cies.
On the other hand, 3,000 years of history make
of Ethiopia a profoundly African state in all that
term implies. In the United Nations, she has been
to the forefront in the defense of Africa’s racial,
economic, and social interests.
Finally, both culturally and geographically,
Ethiopia serves to a unique degree as the link
between the Middle East and Africa. Situated
in the horn of Africa, and along the shores of
the Red Sea, with the desert area of Africa to
