Background
On December 11, 1946, the ﬁrst session of the
United Nations General Assembly unanimously
adopted a resolution condemning enocide as a
crime under international law.2 T at resolution
declared that unislnnent of the crime of genocide,
the denial of t e right to existence of entire human
groups, is a matter of international concern. It
recommended international cooperation with a
view to facilitating the prevention and punish-
ment of genocide and r nested the Economic and
Social Council of the United Nations to undertake
the necessary studies to draw up a draft conven-
tion on the subject.
Pursuant to this resolution, a special United
Nations committee met in 1948 and prepared a
draft convention on genocide. This draft was
reviewed by the Economic and Social Council and
in the fall of 1948 was transmitted to the General
Assembly. The legal committee of the General
Assembly debated the matter and the convention
was adopted by unanimous vote of the General
Assembly on December 9, 1948.
Slgnoturo of the Convention
The Genocide Convention was opened for signa-
ture on December 11, 1948. Pursuant to its terms,
it remained open for signature until December 31,
1949 and subsequently for accession by nations
which had not si ned. It was signed on behalf of
43 nations, including the United States. Of that
number 27 have since ratiﬁed the convention and
thus become parties to it. Sixteen other nations
have become parties by deposit of instruments of
accession.
The act of signature of the Genocide Convention
imported neither a legal nor a moral obligation to
ratif the convention. Signature of a treaty is
mere y the last formal ste between completion of
successful negotiations anld submission of the doc-
ument for approval and ratiﬁcation by the com-
petent authorities of the signatory states. Signa-
ture of a treaty on behalf of a state creates no
obligation to ratify the treaty.
The terms of the Genocide Convention require
that it be ratiﬁed in order to become effective after
signature. It cannot be made effective as an execu-
tive agreement. The second paragraph of article
XI speciﬁcally provides:
The present convention shall be ratiﬁed. and the instru-
ments of ratiﬁcation shall be deposited with the Secretary
General of the United Nations.
Consequently, a signatory government is not
bound by the convention until it has deposited its
instrument of ratiﬁcation and the convention has
been brought into force with respect to it. Gov-
ernments which have signed the Genocide Con-

vention but have failed to ratify it are under no
legal duty to execute its provisions or to carry out
in any way the obligations created by it.

pursuant to its terms, on January 2, 1951, the 90th
ay following the date of deposit of the 20th in-
strument of ratiﬁcation or accession. It became

osited the necessary ratiﬁcations or accessions.

Tho Unltod States Has Not Rotllled tho
Gonocldo Convontlon
The convention was signed on behalf of the
United States on December 11, 1948, by Ernest
A. Gross, acting under a full power issued by the
President authorizing him to Sign a convention for'
the prevention and punishment of the crime of
genocide, “the said convention to be transmitted
to the President of the United States of America
for his ratiﬁcation, subject to the advice and con-
sent thereto of the Senate of the United States of
America.”
The President transmitted the convention to
the United States Senate on June 16, 1949 for ad-
vice and consent to ratiﬁcation. It was referred to
the Foreign Relations Committee and ordered to be
printed.“ Public hearings were held in January
and February of 1950 before a subcommittee, and
the convention was thereafter discussed in execu-
tive sessions of the Foreign Relations Committee.
After nearly 5 years the Genocide Convention is
still pending in the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee without having received the recom-
mendation of that committee.
In accordance with the statement of the Sec-
retary of State before the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee on April 6, 1953, the Department of State is
not pressing for ratiﬁcation of the Genocide Con-
vention.‘
'The U. S. S. R. deposited its ratiﬁcation, with reserva-
tions. on May 3. 1954. It will become effective on August
1, 1954, the 90th day after deposit.
