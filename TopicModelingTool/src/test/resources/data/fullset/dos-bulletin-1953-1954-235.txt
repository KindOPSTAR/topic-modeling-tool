with the date of termination of the a reement.
If this consideration should lead the ouncil to
set a ﬁgure for exports lower than that which
would otherwise have been established, the man-
ager of the buffer stock is authorized to sell at any
price not less than the ﬂoor price the quantities of
tin metal by which the Council has reduced the
permissible rate of exports.
On the termination of the a eement, the man-
ager would close the buffer stoc account and make
no further purchases of tin metal. The agreement
speciﬁes the steps by which the buffer stock would
t en be liquidated. However, the Council is au-
thorized to substitute other arrangements if these
are favored by a majority of the producer votes
and a majority of the consumer votes.
The manager would ﬁrst set aside a sum sufﬁci-
ent to meet the estimated expenses of liquidation or
would sell a sufﬁcient quantity of tin metal to
provide the additional sum required if the balance
remaining in the buffer stock account were inade-
quate to meet those estimated expenses. The
manager would then divide the cash and tin metal
at his disposal between contributing countries in
proportion to the contributions they had made to
the buffer stock. If any contributin countries
had forfeited rights to participate in iquidation,
these countries would be excluded from the divi-
sion to that extent and the residue would be divided
proportionately between the other contributing
countries.
Thereafter the mana r would repay to each
contributing country t 1e cash standing to its
credit. He would transfer to each contributing
country the tin metal standing to the credit of that
country. These transfers of metal would be made
in 12 monthly installments which would be as
nearly equal as possible. Alternatively, at the
option of any contributing country, the manager
would sell any such installment and pay to the
country the net proceeds of such sale. \Vhen the
manager had disposed of all of the tin metal in
this manner, he would distribute between the con-
tributing countries any balance remainin of the
sum which had been set aside to cover t e esti-
mated expenses of liquidation.
Finance
The ex enses of delegations to the Council or
its commutees would be met by their respective
governments. Two separate accounts would be
kept of the contributions and ex enses necessary
for the administration and operation of the agree-
ment. One of these, the administrative account,
would hear the administrative and ofﬁce expenses
of the Council, including the remuneration of the
chairman, secretary, manager, and subordinate
staffs. The other, called the buffer stock account,
would receive the buffer stock contributions from
participating countries and would hear all ex en-
itures incurred in the course of or attributab e to
buﬂ‘er stock transactions or operations, including
all expenses of storage, commissions, insurance,
and telephone and telegraph facilities.
The Council would estimate in each ﬁscal year
the prospective requirements of the administra-
tive account. Each participating government
would be assessed in sterling for its portion of
those expenses. Governments would be liable for
the prompt payment of 1/2000th of the adminis-
trative budget in respect of each vote held in the
Council on the day of the assessment. However,
the agreement provides that no participating gov-
ernment shall contribute less than the equiva ent
of £100 annually.
Payments into the administrative account would
be made in sterling from the type of sterling ac-
count appropriate to the particular country, but
any country could choose to make its payment in
U.S. dollars which the Council would convert into
sterling on the ofﬁcial London Foreign Exchange
market. If the Council subsequently became oh i-
gated to repay a participating government which
had elected to make its contribution in U.S. dol-
lars, that countr could require the payment to be
applied on its ehalf in the purchase of U.S.
do lars in the same proportion to the total dis-
bursement that the sterling bought with U.S. dol-
lars had borne to the total contribution previously
made by the country. The agreement provides
that the United Kingdom Government would er-
mit payments on this basis to be converted) as
required.
The Council could deprive any country of its
right to vote if the country failed to pay its contri-
bution to the administrative account within 6
months after notice of assessment. If a country
had not paid within 12 months after assessment,
the Council could deprive it of any other rights
under the agreement, including such proportion
of rights to partici ate in the liquidation of the
buffer stock as wou d be equivalent to the unpaid
contribution toward administrative expenses. On
payment of the outstanding contribution, the
council would restore any rights of which a coun-
try had been deprived in this connection.
If it appeared at any time that a shortage of
tin had eveloped or was expected, the Council
could assemble authoritative estimates of supplies
and requirements and take into account the prob-
able increase or decrease in stocks of tin. The
Council could consider the likelihood of a serious
shortage and submit recommendations to the par-
ticipating countries with a view to insurin the
maximum development of production an the
equitable distribution of available supplies of tin
metal at a price which would not be higher than
the ceiling price. It would be understood that the
Council would have authority to revise this price
by a majority of the votes cast by the producing
countries and a majority of the votes cast by the
consuming countries. For this purpose the Coun-
cil is authorized to communicate to governments
