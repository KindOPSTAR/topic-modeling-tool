duction is the key to lower prices and hi her living
standards, and all of these raw materia 8, together
with others that Spain will be roviding from her
own resources, Will go into }Spanish industrial
production.
Agricultural production is likewise expected
to beneﬁt from the program, and about $81/2 mil-
lion has already been programed for agricultural
machinery and equipment of various kinds. These
imports will include: machinery for land reclama-
tion and irrigation projects and certain well-drill-
ing equipment; tractors and other land tillage and
harvestin machinery for the farmer; as well as
some equipment in connection with reforestation
pro ams.
T e importance of providing a larger and a
steadier sup 1y of electric power to Spanish in-
dustry and panish homes is a parent to all. Ap-
proximatel $121/2 million wi 1 be devoted to this
purpose. 5 million of this amount will ro-
vide equipment and materials urgently neede to
get certain existing power plants or ower in-
stallations now being constructed into fu l produc-
tion at the earliest moment. The balance of a -
gloximately $715 million is to be devoted to t e
ancin of certain completely modern thermal
power p ants in key locations in Spain.
The Spanish railroads are to receive ap roxi-
mately $11 million. This rogram of reha ilita-
tion and modernization will) provide a wide range
of material and equipment and should be of great
beneﬁt to those portions of the transportation
system to which it is a plied.
The steel industry, t e products of which play
so important a role in any economy, is to receive
approximately $8 million, about half of which
will go toward increasin production of steel
products, largely sheet stee and tin plate, to both
of which categories Spain now has to devote sub-
stantial amounts of her foreign exchange earnings.
Spanish coal mines are to be assisted in their
rogram of modernization by the provision of
g - to $21/2 million for urgently needed equipment.
It is expected that this investment will result in
a suﬂicient increase in coal production to more than
pay for itself in a very short time by reducing
the necessity for coal imports.
The S anish highway program, and the exten-
sive hydi'aulic works programs, so essential to
Spain’s water supply and irrigation plans, will
together receive a out $5 million in heavy con-
struction equipment.
The cement industry is another essential ele-
ment in the economy and will receive approxi-
mately $4 million. About half of this sum will
be devoted to the provision of machinery and
equipment to increase the efﬁciency and produc-
tion of existing Spanish cement plants, and the
balance will provide a new plant of the most
modern design.
Various factories important to the defense of
Spain, as well as to the civilian economy, will
be provided with machine tools to the amount of
$1 million; and S ain’s civil air transport will
be assisted in its piims for safe and efﬁcient serv-
ice by imports of about $% million in ground
control equipment.
It is eXpected that the ﬁrst phase of an intensive
rogram of technical assistance will require about
£1 million of this year’s funds.
Oil-Shore Procurement
Besides the above program of direct aid under
immediate consideration, there is also the oppor-
tunity now being developed for Spain to partici-
pate to an increasing degree in the Off-Shore Pro-
curement Program. This program, generally
speaking, is designed to assist the economies of
friendly Western nations by allowing them to par-
ticipate in supplyin various items for military
use in the defense ongVestern Europe. Contracts
negotiated under this program are to be aid for
in dollars and in this way will beneﬁt Spain’s for-
eign exchange situation as well as increase its in-
dustrial potential to the extent that Spain partici-
pates in the program.
A Spanish ﬁrm obtained last year one contract
in the amount of $2.8 million, and there are now
under active consideration bids of other Spanish
concerns for further contracts totalin a consid-
erable larger amount. For instance, a ready, ac-
cording to recent news from the United States
Military Headquarters in Germany, Spain is about
to receive an additional contract for nearly $2 mil-
lion worth of munitions.
Incidentally, in line with this same program,
Spain has furnished the American Army Quarter-
master Corps during recent months fresh fruit and
vegetables worth nearly $500,000. Such a hopeful
start gives us a reasonable expectation that Spain
will continue an increasingly successful participa-
tion in this important economic development.
Cooperation between Spain and the United
States does not stop with the fulﬁllment of these
commitments. Recently, the two Governments
arrived at an understanding whereby Spain would
be able to obtain approximately 300,000 tons of
wheat, to be paid for in pesetas, which in turn
would be spent in Spain by the United States Gov-
ernment to defray part of the cost of base con-
struction and other United States expenses in
Spain.
Of the greatest interest, however, is the matter
of trade. I honestly believe that there is no part
of United States foreign economic policy which
has been given such painstaking study during the
past year as that of trade. A month ago an im-
portant trade mission interested primarily in agri-
cultural commodities visited Spain for 4 days, ex-
amining carefully diﬂ'erent phases of United
States-Spanish trade. They were cordially re-
