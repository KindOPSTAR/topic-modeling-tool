THE DEPARTMENT



Signiﬁcance of Department’s
Exchange Program
Press release 160 dated March 24
The signiﬁcance of the Department of State’s
International Educational Exchange Program as
an “indispensable instrument of American under-
standing and good will” was em hasized March 24
by the ‘hairman of the U.S. dvisory Commis-
sion on Educational Exchange, J. L. Morrill, pres-
ident of the University of Minnesota, in the Ad-
visory Commission’s Eleventh Semiannual Report
to the Congress.1
‘H. Doc. 355, 83d Cong, 2d sess., transmitted Mar. 24.
Based on visits to Usis installations in seven
countries in Europe last summer, Chairman Mor-
rill returned ﬁrmly convinced of the immediate
and long-range values of educational exchange.
He reported:
I have returned with the clear-cut conviction that the
values of educational exchange are demonstrable: that
the program is indispensable as an instrument of Ameri-
can understanding and good will—more valuable, indeed.
for the long-range realization of our objectives than any
other aspect of our non-military eﬂorts overseas.
It has been said that it is far easier to import a culture
than to export it. This observation illustrates the diﬂer-
ence between exchange and propaganda. Invariably, I
found that those people in other countries who had par-
ticipated in exchange programs and who spoke from
their own experience among us, their own knowledge of
us, were the strongest emissaries of American under-
standing abroad. They spread among their fellow-citizens
the contagion of friendly cooperation.
. . . Leadership of most European nations is largely
in the hands of what might be described as an “intellectual
elite"-—nien and women of considerable educational and
professional attainment. The intercultural program of
our Embassies abroad, immensely strengthened by ex-
change relationships, becomes therefore highly signiﬁcant.
As a result of this on-the-s ot survey, Chairman
Morrill recommended strong y to the De artment
of State that a thorough study he ma e of the
organizational set-up of the exchange of persons
operations overseas within the U.S. Information
Agency with a view to making it more effective
and insuring a “responsible autonomous identity”
of the program as distinguished from the informa-
tion program.
Under the terms of the President’s Reorganiza-
tional Plan Number 8, effective August 1, 1953,
the activities of the International Information
Administration of the De artment of State were
transferred to the U.S. In ormation Agency, with
the exception of the International Educational
Exchange Service, which remained in the Depart-
ment. However, by interagency agreement, the
overseas operation of the Exchange Service is
administered by personnel of the Information
Agency.
Commenting on the future effects which might
result from the “present h brid pattern of jomt
State Department and iylsm accountability,”
Chairman Morrill advised the Department to
maintain watchful vigilance:
It must be recognized that our governmental informa~
tion activities are skepticaliy regarded and suspect among
the more sophisticated constituencies of the European na-
tions with cultural traditions older than our own. It is
from these constituencies that leadership emerges—and
these are likewise the constituencies principally aﬂected
by, and concerned with, our exchange and cultural etlorts
abroad.
Quite candidly it is my tentative conclusion. based
upon observation of our Embassy operations, that the
retransfer of the cultural oﬂicers and cultural attaches
from the United States Information Agency to the De-
partment of State, thus reunifying cultural and exchange
activities and responsibilities, would be eminently sound
and desirable—and that this suggestion merits the con-
sideration of the President, the Secretary of State, and
the Congress.
