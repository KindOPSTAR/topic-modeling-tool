lishin a new mechanism consisting of the For-
eign h inisters of the four powers here represented
his the Foreign Minister of Communist China.
t seems to us that the pro sal for a ﬁve-power
conference to include the C inese Communist re-
ime is primarily a device to attempt to secure
or that re 'me a position in the councils of the
world whic it has not earned or had accorded to
it b the international community generally, in-
clu ing the United Nations. Certainly, this four-
power conference is not the place to decide that
matter.
“'e four have met here in Berlin to discuss two
concrete problems—Germany and Austria. For
this discussion we have a special and unique re-
sponsibility as occupying powers. These two
problems are capable of solution and demand
ur nt solution.
t seems to me strange that we should be seek-
ing to enlarge our task even before we have dem-
onstrated that we can solve the particular tasks
which primarily bring us here.
Surely, it would be wrong if, having come to-
ther for the ﬁrst time in 5 years, we should
ritter away our time in discussing whether and
how to set up a new conference rather than in
dealing with the substantive problems which the
world expects us to solve.
The United States therefore proposes that we
should take no action on the first a enda item and
pass on to the second and third. f we can solve
these two problems, then, and then only, can we
stand before the world as capable of assuming
other and heavier tasks. Then there will be
opened up vistas of new hope.
STATEMENT OF JANUARY 29
I have no desire to use whatever little authority
I have as chairman of this meetin to prevent,
arbitrarily, an 'one from speakin a ut any sub-
ject that is on is mind. I recognize that the gen-
eral topic of item one is broad enou h to enable
us to talk about every dproblem in tie world. I
thought we had passe that item by and were
getting to other business, but apparently there is
not unanimous agreement to that effect.
I do feel, however, that I should make certain
observations. The ﬁrst is this: The United States,
and I think France and the United Kin dom—
although I can speak only for my own overn-
ment—came to this conference in the genuine hope
that it would relax international tensions. This
is the ﬁrst of these conferences, the ﬁrst time we
four have met together in 5 years; and we hoped
that this conference would show the utility of
meetin of this sort. I think the United States
shows that when we, at the ﬁrst meeting, accepted
the agenda proposed by the Foreign Minister of
the Soviet Union, although that was not an agenda
which we liked. We knew, however, that to debate
that agenda would increase tension, and it was our
desire to alla tension. Therefore, we accepted
an agenda which we did not like as a contribution
to an atmosphere which we hoped would be con-
ducive to the relaxation of tensions.
The agenda item which we accepted has as its
ﬁrst phrase the words “measures for reducing
tensions in international relations.” I think that
anyone would indeed have to be a conﬁrmed 0 ti-
mist to feel that the discussions so far under t at
item have in fact served to reduce international
tensions. The charges that have been made under
that item and the replies which were necessitated
by those charges have, I think, not gone far to
relax international tensions.
I don’t believe that this conference—the ﬁrst, I
repeat, in 5 years—will justify itself and make it
easier to maintain these channels of personal con-
tact at a high level, unless we can do better than
we have been doing so far. I believe that this con-
ference, to justify itself, must get down to serious
problems which we are competent to solve and
which are eculiarly our duty to solve here in the
city of Be in, rather than to roam about the )rob-
lems of the world, raising issues which we all now
cannot be solved here, and the discussion of which
mere] increases international tension. So far, all
that t iis conference has done—now in its ﬁfth day
of deliberations—is to discuss futilely how to create
new conferences. It seems tc me that if confer-
ences can do nothing better than to create new
conferences, and the new conferences do nothing
better than to create more new conferences the
whole conference method will become an object
of ridicule, and we with it.
I wonder whether the Soviet Foreign Minister
really believes the cause of world eace will be ad-
vanced and world tension relaxed y our having to
debate here a resolution which is hoary with age,
being the precise resolution which was introduced
into the United Nations General Assembly 2 years
ago, which has been discussed and discussed with-
out result; “ and if this conference can do nothing
better than to busy itself with these already-
proved abortive pro ls, then I don’t think we
are justifying the time and eﬂ'ort which we are
spendin here, or meeting the hopes which the
world p aces in us. There are two problems on
which we could do serious constructive business,
the problem of Germany and the problem of
Austria. If we could solve these problems, or
either of these problems, or if we could make
progress toward a solution of these problems or
either of these problems, or indeed if we could,
like sensible peo le, talk about them in a serious
way—any one of these things would justify our
being here and would give rise to the hope that
we are able to talk together in a sensible and decent
way around the table. That would go far to reduce
world tensions. If, on the other hand, this meet-
