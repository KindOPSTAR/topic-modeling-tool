U. N. Releases Prisoners of War
Following are the texts of statements regarding
the release 0 prisoners of war in Korea made by
Gen. John . Hull, United Nations Commander,
Secretary Dulles, Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., U. S.
Re esentative to the United Nations, and James
J. gadsworth, Aotin U .8. Representative to the
United Nations; an of an exchange of letters
between Gen. K. S. Thimag/ya, Chairman of the
Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and
General Hull:
GENERAL HULL'S STATEMENT OF JANUARY 23
By action of the Chairman of the NNRC those
anti-Communist Pow’s who did not choose to be
repatriated or to remain in NNRC custod for
assistance in going to neutral nations were re eased
to territory under UNC control.
The action of releasing these Pow’s without de-
claring their civilian status cannot, under the
shall see a revulsion everywhere against commu-
nism and all it stands for, an inevitable part of
which will be a shattering of faith in Moscow and
Peiping themselves and a convulsive breakup of
the whole monolithic structure. The more we can
succeed in strengthening the faith of the peoples
imprisoned behind the Iron Curtain, the more con-
vincing evidence we can give of our sup ort of
their cause, the more rapid that breakup W1 1 be.
It goes without sayin that in the contest ahead
we should do nothing to elp the Communist camp
overcome its difﬁculties. It also goes without say-
ing that we must strive to make the very most of
our own opportunities, in particular, to set an
example impregnable to Communist falsehood and
slander.
I said I should end with Jefferson. From a cen-
tury and a half ago he reminds us that we are not
“acting for ourselves alone, but for the whole
human race. The event of our experiment is to
show whether man can be trusted with self-
government. The eyes of suffering humanity are
ﬁxed on us with anxiety as their only hope, and on
such a theatre for such a cause we must suppress
all smaller passions and local considerations.”
And again: “The station which we occupy among
the nations of the earth is honorable, but awful.
. . . And to what sacriﬁces of interest, or conven-
ience, ought not these considerations to animate
us? To what compromises of opinion and inclina-
tion, to maintain harmony and union among our-
selves, and to preserve from all danger this hal-
lowed ark of human hope and happiness.”
agreement on Pow’s, lawfully result in the inhu-
manity of continued indeﬁnite imprisonment for
thousands of Koreans and Chinese.
The Use has repeatedly stated that it would
full respect the rights of the Pow’s as set forth
in t e Terms of Reference of the NNRO annexed to
the Armistice Agreement. The Terms of Refer-
ence were developed in solemn agreement between
the opposing sides in the Korean conflict. They
were intended, and must be given effect, as a guar-
antee against indeﬁnite captivity. Accordingly,
all prisoners who have not chosen to be repatriated
are entitled, now that the 120-day period for their
custody by the NNBC has expired, to their freedom
as civilians and to have this freedom respected by
all concerned. The UNC considers that these for-
mer prisoners now have civilian status. As of 0001
hours Korean time on 23 January 1954 they be-
came free men.
