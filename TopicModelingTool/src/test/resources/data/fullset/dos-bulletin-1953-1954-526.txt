In addition to the recently extended program
agreement between UNRWA and Jordan under
w lich UNRWA agreed to reserve $40 million for
such river and power development as was feasible
and would plrincipall beneﬁt refugees, UNRWA
and Jordan ave an 11 million program agree-
ment of 1952 to provide a living for approximately
6,000 refugee families (30,000 refu ees) . A num-
ber of pr01ects have been complete under this lat-
ter agreement. A vocational training program
estimated to cost $1 million has also been under-
taken. Still other projects include loans to pri-
vate enter rises providing employment of refugees
through tie Jordan Development Bank, part of
whose capital is subscribed by UNRWA.
In Syria UNRWA has concluded a program agree-
ment with the Syrian Government which reserves
$30 million for agricultural, technical training,
educational, and other projects to provide employ-
ment for the 85,000 refugees now resident in Syria.
One agricultural settlement for 200 families (1,000
refugees) is near completion. As to larger-scale
projects in Syria attempts have also been made to
rid areas suitable for Signiﬁcant agricultural de-
velopment, and two survey expeditions have been
made for this purpose in the northern and north-
eastern arts of the country. The conclusion
reached UNRWA was that op ortunities existed
on State omain land not only or major schemes,
but also for many ro'ects involving only minor
pumping from the up rates, which could be com-
pleted and put to use com aratively quickly. De-
tailed topo aphical, engineering, and soﬂs sur-
veys wou d ave to be made before the suitability
of any given site for a major scheme could be ac-
curately assessed, but government permission for
these surveys has not yet been forthcoming.
The Egyptian Government has extended full
cooperation to UNRWA with respect to the 200,000
refugees at Gaza. Surveys were made 2 years a o
for under ound water resources which would e
capable o supporting refugee communities in that
area. The results of these surveys were negative.
During the past year consideration has been given
to the possibility of siphoning water from a sweet-
water canal fed by the Nile, under the Suez Canal
to the Sinai Peninsula, and reclaiming lands in
that area which might beneﬁt some 60 to 70 thou-
sand refugees. Detailed surveys as to the feasi-
bility and extent of the irri able area, expected to
be completed within 8 mont is, are now bein made
under a program a cement between the gyp-
tian Government an UNRWA, for which $30 mil-
lion has been reserved by UNRWA.
Loans and Credits
The ﬁnal type of U.S. Government cooperation
with the Near East is in the ﬁeld of loan and
credit assistance since the Second World War. It
may be summarized as follows:
The Export-Import Bank of Washington, as of
April 12, 1954
the end of ﬁscal year 1953, had afforded the fol-
lowing credits: Afghanistan, $21 million author-
ized, of which $17.5 million disbursed; Turkey,
$46 million authorized, approximately $30 million
disbursed and $14 million canceled; Israel, $135
million authorized, approximately $130 million
disbursed; Egy t, $7.25 million authorized and
disbursed; Saucii Arabia, $29 million authorized,
$15 million disbursed, and the balance canceled or
allowed to expire; Ethiopia, $3 million authorized
and virtually all disbursed. Total disbursements
of Export-Import Bank development loans at end
of the last ﬁscal year therefore total approxi-
mately $203 million.
Ofﬁce of the F orei Li uidation Commission
credits for surplus orld Var II property uti-
lized by Near Eastern countries total approxi-
mately $50 million, broken down as follows: Iran,
$30 million; Egypt, $10 million; Turkey, $6 mil-
lion; Saudi Ara ia, $2 million; Lebanon, $1.5
million; and Ethiopia, $0.5 million. Some of the
ECA/MSA/FOA (Marshall lan) aid to Turkey has
been on a loan, rather t an rant basis. U.S.
loans to this country total $14 million. Turke
also utilized a credit of $3 million from the U. .
Maritime Commission.
The U.S. loans disbursed and credits utilized
by the above-named countries add up to $396
million. In addition, the U.S. owns a proxi-
mately 32 percent of the shares of the nterna-
tional Bank for Reconstruction and Development
which has extended loans to Turkey, $59.6 mil-
lion; Iraq, $12.8 million; and Ethiopia, $8.5
million; or a total of $80.9 million.
Conclusion
Today economic cooperation with the Middle
East at the governmental level, as indicated above,
ma be divided into four principal categories:
technical assistance, special economic or grant aid,
aid to Palestine refugees, and loans. at what
is the outlook for the future?
The report recently issued by the President’s
Commissmn on Forei Economic Policy (the
“Randall Commission” ° gives us an indication of
things to come. First, the Commission recom-
mended that in general the technical assistance
rogram should be pressed vigorously within the
'mitations of appropriations and the availability
of sound rojects and skilled technicians and

that economic aid on a grant asis should be ter-
minated as soon as possible. Where substantial
economic aid is necessary and not otherwise avail-
able, loans should be made and not ants. How-
ever, the interesting qualiﬁcation w iich the Com-
mission madHigmﬁcant to the area here
considered—was that in underdeveloped countries
moderate grants in aid might be made where
