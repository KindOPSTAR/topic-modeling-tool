longer be paralyzed by the Communist abuse of
the veto.) _ .
This growth of the General Assembly 18 in
many ways a sound development because a solid
foundation for peace actually depends on two
things: (1) the existence of common practical
interests; and (2) the existence of a common sense
of 'ustice, which means a common sense of right
an wron and a common view of the relation of
the individual to his overnment.
Until both of these timings exist, those who insist
on schemes for world union or world government
do more harm than good because, like someone
feeding fried potatoes to a newborn baby, they
are tryinv to ram somethin down the throat of
the worl which it cannot digest. If any one of
the 13 colonies, at the time of the American Revo-
lution, had had a view of life as different from
the rest of the world as the view of the Soviet
Union is different from the free world today, there
would have been no United States. The Ameri-
can revolutionists, unlike the people of the world
today, all had the same general thoughts about
the nature of man.
In the modern world there is already a growing
knowledge that countries have many common
practical interests. But the growth of a common
sense of justice seems to come more slowly—and,
as any effective scheme for world order depends
on such a sense of 'ustice, the essential ﬁrst step
is a world forum w ere issues can be debated and
put to a vote and where world ublic opinion can
evelop. The General Assemb y is thus a place
where they “talk and vote”—just as the do in any
democratic assemblage—because it is Try talking
and voting that you sometimes avert war, and it 18
by talking and voting that you build a world sense
of right and wrong.
The 60 member nations of the United Nations
are a sizeable majority of the world’s nations and
of the world’s po ulation. The General Assembly
is, therefore, t is indispensable ﬁrst step—the
necessary foundation for any future world order
which mankind may wish to build. It is as far
as we can go now. But we should go this far.
Accomplishments ot the Unlted Natlena
The United Nations is a place where:
. . . public opinion is developed—and public
opinion makes things happen in spite of iron
curtains.
. . we can see what the Communists are doing
in the war of ideas—and sometimes in other ways.
Without it we could not see nearly as much.
. . . you can get authoritative reactions quickly
on the state of opinion in almost any part of the
world, which it would take days, if not weeks, to
get otherwise.
. Americans can see how their American pub-
lic servants are conducting the American side
of the cold war. It therefore enables us to cor-
rcct our mistakes more uickly and with greater
sureness than we could 0 otherwise.
. . . the free world gets consolidated. Being
free, the non-Communist nations naturally tend
to go their own way and to drift apart. But
sooner or later some Communist spokesman will
make some statement that is so monstrous that ou
can almost see the free nations getting toget ier
before your very eyes. This more than counter-
balances whatever advantages the Communists
may get out of their propa anda.
. . . we have develope valuable allies—cer-
tainl not as many as we should have liked. But,
equa ly certain, whatever allies we have are wel-
come and are that much clear gain.
. . six of the member nations are peoples who
were under alien control when the charter was
signed. Of the 800 million people in the free
world who were de ndent 10 years ago, some 600
million—or three- ourths—have won full inde-
pendence since 1945. The newly independent
countries which belong to the United Nations in-
clude India, Pakistan, Burma, the Philippines,
Indonesia, and Israel.
. . . representatives of nations can meet with-
out formality to settle disputes. Those who want
to divide and rule are impeded, for this is a hard
game to play when the entire free world is look-
ing on.
. . . the threat of war in Iran in 1946, due to
pressure of Russian troops, was moderated and
gradually extinguished.
. . the initiative was taken, with substantial
American backing, to prevent Communist en-
croachment on Greece in 1947.
. . . open warfare over Kashmir between India
and Pakistan was stopped.
. . . the advent of Israel into the family of
nations was determined and an end ut to a bloody
war in the Holy Land, although t 1e situation is
still dangerous.
. working with the Netherlands and the In-
donesians, full independence was given to the 76
million people inhabiting Indonesia.
. . . art of the free world was organized to
repel the bloody aggression in Korea, which
threatened the whole free world—and not only in
Asia.
. . . the Kremlin has a real headache in the
United Nations. They cannot control the United
Nations; they cannot break it up; they dare not
leave it.
What Unltod Nations I! Not
The United Nations is not a world government.
It cannot impose a tax of any kind. It cannot
draft a single soldier—from any country for serv-
ice in Korea or elsewhere. Its charter speciﬁcally
