of Malaya with the civil and military authorities,
substantial progress has been made in countering
this Communist threat. Indicative of the improv-
ing situation is the fact that almost one-fourth of
the poo le of the Federation now live in areas
where t e elimination of Communist terrorism
has permitted the resumption of normal living.
With the steady improvement in the military sit-
uation, Malaya has taken substantial steps toward
res onsible self- overnment.

The Korean People’s Right to Unity and Independence
STATEMENT BY UNDER SECRETARY SNIlTl-l1
Durin all these sessions on Korea the U.S. del-
egation as listened, at times with sincere ad-
miration and at other times with profound mis-
givings, while on the one hand representatives of
the free nations of Asia, Africa, Europe, and
America have called for a constructive effort to
unite this unhappy country, and on the other hand
our Communist colleagues have denounced and
distorted every ideal to which we subscribe and
eve democratic principle which we cherish.
T e date of May 11, 1954, may stand out in the
history of our times as an occasion of ave revela-
tion. On that day, in this room, the oviet Union
throu h its delegate denounced the United Nations
and c aracterized it as a belligerent institution,
unworthy of conﬁdence. That the representa-
tives of the Chinese and North Korean Com-
munist regimes reiterated this denunciation is
regrettable but not surprising. Both have been
declared aggressors by the United Nations.
Many words, good and bad, have been spoken
here since this Conference met, but none have been
clearer in intent or more serious in implication
than the words of the delegate of the Soviet Union
on the 11th of this month at the ninth plenary
session on Korea. All of us who heard them re-

member, but I repeat them so we may focus on
their meaning. He spoke as follows:
What conclusions can be draWn with regard to the
United Nations Organization from the facts pertaining
to the war in Korea? The conclusions are clear. As a
result of a number of illegitimate actions on the part
of the Security Council and the General Assembly, the
United Nations Organization became a belligerent in
Korea. In fact, the Unlted Nations ﬂag was used there
only to cover up American aggresslon.
In the eyes of the peoples of the whole world, this
turning of the Unlted Natlons Organization into a belliger-
ent greatly diminished the prestige of this international
organization. Under the circumstances, the Unlted Na-
tions Organization has deprived itself of the capacity to
act as an impartial lnternatlonal body and can no longer
carry out objective functions in the settlement of the
Korean problem.
B the word “American” the Soviet dele to in-
ten ed to designate the United States. t gives
me satisfaction that there are two other nations
from the Americas represented here—Canada and
Colombia. The also sent their sons to Korea to
defend the idea that the United Nations ﬂag is
not a scra of cloth. What the 16 nations here
represente did in Korea, acting together under
that ﬂagi in accordance with resolutions of the
United ations, was done because of their com-
mon belief in deep-rooted moral rinciples for
which men are willing to die. The nited States
is proud of its role in Korea and of its associates
there. It believes that all ple who long for a .
free and peaceful world ta e pride in the role of
the United Nations in Korea. The blood of the
