ary; it has not brought, and will not bring, the
mlllennium. But it is useful; its cost is small; it
is an intelligent ﬁrst step : it stands between us and
international anarch . It thus stands between us
and World War II or the extinction of human
freedom—or both. Finally, it represents another
important step in man’s long march toward free-
dom—a marc with so many impressive associa-
tions with this historic city and this historic House
of Burgesses.

[Enclosure]
COMMUNICATION DATED 10 JANUARY 1954 FROM
THE PRESIDENT OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
TO ALL MEMBER STATES
1. I have the honour to refer to A/RESOLUTION/178
passed by the General Assembly on 8 December 1953.
2. The Government of India have availed themselves
of the provisions in sub-paragraph (b) of paragraph 2
of the said resolution and requested me to reconvene the
eighth session of the General Assembly “in reasonable
time prior to the date of the dissolution of the Neutral
Nations Repatriation Commission" which, they inform
me, should take place before 23 February.
3. The request made by the Government of India is, in
my considered Judgment, warranted by the “develop-
ments in respect of the Korean question" as contemplated
by the General Assembly's resolution.
4. The Government of India have made no speciﬁc sug-
gestion as to the date of reconvening the eighth session.
An appropriate date, in my judgment, would be 9 Febru-
ary, which falls midway between the two relevant dates
of 23 January and 23 February and is also on a Tuesday
which, as you know, is the day of the week on which the
General Assembly has usually been convened.
5. In pursuance of the request made to me by the Gen-
eral Assembly, I request your concurrence t0 the initiative
I am taking in reconvening the eighth session of the Gen-
eral Assembly at New York on Tuesday, 9 February 1954,
at 15:00 hours. In view of the limited time available,
I shall be grateful if you will communicate your reply to
‘A/Resolution/173, which requested the President of
the General Assembly “to reconvene the eighth session,
with the concurrence of the majority of Member States,
if (a) in her opinion developments in respect of the
Korean question warrant such reconvening, or, (b) one
or more Member States make a request to the President
for such reeonvening by reason of developments in re-
spect of the Korean question."
'The Secretary-General later extended this deadline to
Jan. 29. By that date, 22 countries had expressed con-
currence, 28 bud disappmved the proposal, and 10 had not
replied. On Jan. 30 he informed U.N. members that the
requisite majority required by A/RESOLUTION/173 had
not been obtained.
