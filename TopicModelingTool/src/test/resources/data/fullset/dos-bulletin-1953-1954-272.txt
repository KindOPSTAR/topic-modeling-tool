United States in the Middle East. \Ve are en-
aged, as we all know, in a historic struggle with
forces dedicated to an ideology wholly at vari-
ance with our own. In this historic contest, which
goes on every minute of every day in this year of
1954, we are employing the strate of trying
to create stability, order, and peace ul progress
as the bulwarks of freedom. Our opponents em-
ploy the strategy of creating chaos, conﬂict, and
political confusion. In the Middle East, as every-
where, our objective is to do all that we can to
establish conditions which will permit the na-
tions of that region to forge ahead toward new
horizons of social and economic well-being. And
it is in the context of this lobal policy that we
are supporting the proposa to harness and use
the waters of the Jordan for the beneﬁt of man.
Developing the resources of the Jordan Valley
as a com )rehensive uniﬁed project seems to me
the only 0 ical ap reach to a serious practical
problem. The Jordan River system, including
the main trunk and its tributaries, is an inter-
national stream. F our sovereign states have legit-
imate interests in some of the water and some of
the lands of the river basin. Even in the most
favorable circumstances—even if these four states
were on the best of terms with one another—it
Seems obvious that the use of these waters would
have to be worked out with due re ard to their
respective rights and interests. An in the polit-
ica climate which pervades the Middle East to-
day, it would seem to be more than ever impera-
tive to approach the problem of the river’s de-
velopment internationally. Unilateral efforts to
harness the stream can only be ex cted to create
further tension. They could easi y lead to open
conﬂict. Unless some mutually acceptable de-
velo ment lan can be elaborated, the situation
coul readi y become one in which whoever can
take the water will get it, and I need not amplify
the consequences which might ensue in that event.
Analyzing the Proposal
Very brieﬂy, I would like to ex lain the prin-
cipal elements of this proposal, as? laid it before
the Jordan Valley states in October and November.
First, however, I should like to make it clear to
you, as I have made it clear to them, that no one
is being offered a hard and fast proposition on a
take-it-or-leave-it basis. During my conversations
with the leaders of the states concerned, I made
it abundantly clear that their suggestions for mod-
iﬁcation of our basic conception would be most
welcome. Indeed, I urged them to put forward
any suggestions they might feel to be necessary in
their own national interests. I assured them that
the United States will give all such suggestions
the most careful consideration so long as they do
not do violence to the fundamental idea of a com-
prehensive, uniﬁed approach to the valley’s devel-
opment.
There is an im rtant diﬂ'erence, of course, be-
tween pro osals or modiﬁcation of a basic pro-
gram an proposals involvin a totally new
engineering conception or olitical approach. I
hope most sincere y that t is distinction will be
clear to the governments of the states concerned.
The development program embodied in the UN.
re rt was conceived by engineers and not by
p0 iticians; it offers a ractical basis on which the
ife-giving waters of tie Jordan can be used for
the greatest beneﬁt of the most people—and that
is the goal we are seeking to accomplish. If any
or all of the interested states can recommend a
change here or a change there to better accomplish
this objective, such changes can, of course, be
incorporated in an ultimate plan. At the same
time, there is a “hard core” to the plan, which is
its purpose of equitable use of the available re-
sources for the general welfare of the people of
the area. It WllI be understood that ‘counter-
plans” based on totally new conce tions and cal-
culated to accomplish political en would not be
compatible with this princi le.
I say this uite candidly ause I believe that
the roposal or uniﬁed development of the Jordan
Vallje should be considered outside the context
of po itical issues and without prejudice to their
ultimate solution. These issues must be resolved,
and as s dily as possible, of course, if there is
to be rea peace in the area. But the United States
Government, which has made a strai htforward
and constructive offer of assistance wit 1 respect to
the Jordan Valley, cannot be expected to abandon
the basic premise on which the original proposal
was made, namely, the most efficient and economi-
cal use of the waters of the Jordan. I feel conﬁdent
that the statesmen of the Middle East, both in
Israel and in the Arab States, will clearly reco -
nize the importance of elaborating an acceptabI
program on a technical and practical level and
will ut forward constructive suggestions within
the mework of basic principles laid before
them several months ago.
For our own part, we have one to considerable
lengths, I feel, to relieve this ordan Valley proj-
ect of any implications of a political character.
We have, for exam le, suggested a formula for
acceptance of a uni ed plan which would obviate
the necessity of formal agreement between any
of the states concerned. This formula envisages
acceptance unilaterally by each of the four coun-
tries through separate declarations of acceptance
ﬁled with the United Nations or some other neutral
and impartial body.
Suggeetlon for International “Water-Master"
Similarly, we have offered in advance a sugges-
tion for eventual control of the water system of
the valley by an international authority, a board
or commissioner or some similar instrumentality,
which would remove exclusive control of the waters
