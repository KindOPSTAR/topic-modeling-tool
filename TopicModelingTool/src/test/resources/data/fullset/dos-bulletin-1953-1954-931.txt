midst from time to time, had tangible evidence
that the United Nations was doing what it could
to support and encoura e their effort to remain
free. Here is a case of t e United Nations’ being
right on the ﬁring line.
As these observers collected their evidence and
reported it to the United Nations, it became in-
contestable that fullscale externally sponsored
Communist subversion and inﬁltration of Greece
was under way. Britain and the United States
moved quickly to provide Greece with the military
and economic asmstance she required to maintain
her independence. This turned the tide. By 1952
the Balkan Committee withdrew from Greece, but
a handful of United Nations observers under the
Peace Observation Commission have continued to
kee the situation along the northern frontier
un er watch. And now, since conditions are tran—
quil, the observers are being withdrawn at Greece’s
request.
Looking back at the critical situation confront-
ing Greece, I do not claim that observation and
reporting under the United Nations was the dom-
inant factor in stemming the tide of Communist
expansionism then threatening Greece. Essential
to that task was the military and economic aid
which I have mentioned. Indispensable, of course,
was the courageous resistance and determination
to preserve their national independence exhibited
by the Greek Army and the Greek people in gen-
eral. But it may fairly be claimed that the
arduous and often heroic work performed b the
United Nations observers, and the solid evi ence
which the were able to produce as to the true
state of a airs along the frontiers, constituted an
important deterrent against what might other-
wise have been overt and sweeping acts of aggres-
sion against Greece by the Soviet-dominated
countries to the North.
Two other active observer groups operated by
the United Nations stem from the conﬂicts in
Kashmir and Palestine. These are the United
Nations Truce Supervision Organization for
Palestine and the United Nations Military Ob-
server Group in Kashmir. In both Palestine and
Kashmir the primary function of the observer
groups is to see that the cease-ﬁre agreed to by
the interested parties is maintained.
PALESTINE
Even before the present state of Israel came into
existence, the Truce Supervision Organization for
Palestine was set up in the spring of 1948 in an
attempt to establish and maintain a truce between
Jewish and Arab factions in Palestine. The per-
sonnel for the organization was recruited by the
United Nations from the countries with represent-
atives stationed in Jerusalem. The United States
gladly and promptly made available military per-
sonnel and equipmentin accordance with the estab~
lished understanding which this Government has
with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
In 1949, under the leadershi of Dr. Ralph J.
Bunche, the Governments 0 Egypt, Jordan,
Syria, and Lebanon concluded bilateral armistice
agreements with the new Government of Israel.
Each of these armistice agreements provided for
the continuation of the observer system through
bilateral mixed armistice commissions which were
charged with enforcing the armistice. These
mixed armistice commissions are still in existence
since border incidents and incursions are continu-
ing. The conﬂicts which arise between Israel on
the one hand and one of its Arab neighbors on the
other are handled by the mixed armistice com-
mission concerned. Each incident is investigated
by the United Nations observers and reported to
the mixed armistice commission which is empow-
ered to establish responsibility and to indicate
what remedial action should be taken.
This process, continuing year after year, is, as
you can well imagine, an exhausting and frus-
trating business for the United Nations observers
involved. It is, however, helping to maintain the
armistice while allowing time to work out a perma-
nent settlement of the serious and complicated
roblems facing these newly created and newly
independent countries.
WMIR
You may be less familiar with the peace observa-
tion work in Kashmir since the s1tuation there
attracts headlines with far less frequency. Kash-
mir is located in the northernmost part of the
Indian subcontinent between India and Pakistan.
It is one of the many former princely states that
made up the British Dominion in India. Kash-
mir in area is about the size of your own State of
Minnesota but with variations in altitude from
the hot semitropic lowlands to the Karakoram
range of mountains, which average about 25,000
feet in height. Kashmir became the center of dis-
pute between India and Pakistan when these two
countries were created out of the 01d Indian
Dominion. Fighting broke out in the late fall of
1947, but a cease-ﬁre was ﬁnally established in the
early days of 1949 through the United Nations.
Again United Nations observers were called
upon. Today, stretching across roughly the mid-
dle of the state of Kashmir is a cease-ﬁre line, and
situated at strategic points along that line are
United Nations observer teams who have built up
an extraordinary record for maintaining the cease-
ﬁre. There are today about 65 observers un-
der the able leadership of an Australian major
general.
