This situation has been drastically changed by
two rovisions of the new law. On one hand the
out- ated and inﬂexible contract labor law was
eliminated. Now an alien is permitted to make
arrangements for his employment before he comes
to the United States and may submit evidence
about his employment to show that he is not likely
to become a public char e. Only if the Secretary
of Labor certiﬁes that t ere exists an oversupply
of a given skill in a given locality of the United
States will the immigration of aliens be barred
who pomess such skill and who are coming to this
locality. No such ﬁnding has so far been made
by the Secretary of Labor.
The other provision of the new law which is
helping the ‘new-seed immigrant” as well as
American industry, business and cultural interests
is the one giving a ﬁrst claim to one-half of the
quota of each country to aliens whose services are
needed urgently in the United States because of
their high education, technical training, special-
ized experience, or exceptional ability and to their
spouses and children.
The provision permitting immigrants to have
employment before coming to the United States
eventually will make itself felt also in the distribu-
tion of immigrants throughout the United States.
As long as immi ants had to rely for their im-
migration on atii avits of support from relatives
and friends in this country, the traditional trend
of the immigrant movement continued to be to
urban areas where there was already considerable
immigrant settlement. Now it is to be expected
that the settlement of new immigrants in the
United States will not only be inﬂuenced by their
tendency to go where they have friends or rela-
tives but that it will be guided by job opportunities
throughout the country.
Security Provlslons
Some misunderstanding seems to exist in the
mind of the general public as to the effect the new
law has had on the security provisions applicable
to immigrants. The opinion seems to e wide-
spread that the new law is more exacting in that
res ect. Actually the reverse is true.
I‘D or all racticable purposes the new law has
reenacted t e security provisions which had been
part of the immi ation laws since the passa e in
1950 of the Internal Security Act. One signi cant
change, however, has taken place. In the past, and
ever since 1940, not only present but also former
members of proscribed organizations were ex-
cluded from admission into the United States as
immigrants. For example, an alien who in his
youth some 20 or 30 years ago was a member of
the Communist Party was still ineligible to re-
ceive a visa regardless of the fact that long since
he had given up his early political associations and
had since become an outspoken ﬁghter against
communism.
The new law contains an escape clause for for-
mer voluntary members of proscribed organiza-
tions, a fact which has been given little if any
publicity. The defector clause contained in the
new law permits the issuance of a visa to a former
voluntary member of a proscribed organization if
the alien since the termination of his membership
and for at least 5 years before the date of his visa
a plication has been actively opposed to the prin-
ci les and ideology of the proscribed organization
0 which he was a member.
This provision of law has made it possible to
admit to the United States as immigrants a number
of aliens whose record of the ast years has justi-
ﬁed that the United States s ow forgiveness for
past political association and has thus enabled
us at least indirectly to encourage future
defections.
After this trial period of 15 months we in the
Visa Ofﬁce can say that the new law as far as it
affects the visa function of the Department of
State constitutes a considerable improvement over
the earlier laws. I hope my brief presentation has
shown you that the new law tends to keep families
united in migration, makes the use of quotas more
ﬂexible, and facilitates the admission of “new-
seed immigrants.” It gives due recognition to the
need in the United States for certain skills, pro-
fessional knowledge, and ability. It also opens
the door to those who in the past were permanently
barred for reasons of race or as a result of former
and long past political afﬁliations.
I know that some of you are critical of the basic
philosophy of our immigration laws, particularly
its national-origins quota system, which actually
goes back to the Immigration Act of 1924. In all
fairness to the new law, this criticism I think
should be divorced from a recognition of the fact
that the new law has brought many important im-
provements over the old law, particularly in rela-
tion to its treatment of immigrants.
In their administration, laws can be interpreted
literally and restrictively. On the other hand,
they can be given a reasonable and humane inter-
pretation. I want you to know that ever since
the Immigration and Nationality Act has become
effective we in the Visa Oﬁce ave made every
effort, without doing violence to the lain intent
of the law, to interpret it reasonab y and hu-
manely. In our frequent discussions with the
congressional committees on questions relating to
the interpretation and administration of the law,
we have found that it is also their desire to see
the law administered in a commonsense manner.
I should like to use this opportunity to express
my deep appreciation of the ﬁne cooperation we
in the Department of State have enjoyai in our
close work with the Immigration and Naturaliza-
tion Service. Ever since the new law was enacted,
we have been meeting regularly with representa-
