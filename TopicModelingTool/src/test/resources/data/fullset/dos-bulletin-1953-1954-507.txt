in this country. with a copyright notice on it, it
would automatically receive protection in all the
other countries which are members of the conven-
tion.
The Implementing Legislation
The Universal Convention is, by its terms, what
is generall called non-self-executing. Legisla-
tion b bot Houses of Congress is needed in order
to ma e such changes in the United States law as
are necessary to implement the convention. The
bills before you would, with very minor exce -
tions, make only such changes in the Copyright
Law as are necessary to bring it into full con-
formity with the terms of the convention. The
proposed le islation has been drafted with a view
to making t e changes applicable only to forei
countries which join the convention, and it woiilii
not come into effect until the convention enters
into force with respect to the United States.
These changes would have the effect of exempt-
ing works of authors of convention countries or
works ﬁrst published there from certain formal
provisions of the United States Copyright Law
and of modifying the requirements for notice of
reservation 0 copyright. I wish to comment on
only one of these changes—that relating to the
manufacturing requirement. Experts in the ﬁeld
of copyright who will follow me will discuss the
remainder.
This so-called manufacturing clause means in
effect that a foreign author writing in English
can only obtain 5 years copyright protection in
this country unless his book is printed here.
Such a rovision would not be too surprising in
the law 0 an underdevelo ed country, but it is in-
congruous in the light of our present economic
position in this ﬁeld. It is a carryover from the
days in the late 1800’s when book manufacturing
in this country was an infant industry. Now,
however, we are a ma'or exporter of printed mate-
rials. For example, in 1953 our exports of books
alone totaled over 24 million dollars—well over
twice the level of book imports.
The negotiation of the convention involved con-
siderable ive and take in view of the diﬁerin
systems 0% copyright which it must bridge.
number of countries, particularly the English-
speaking ones, made it clear to us during the
negotiations that one of the things they insisted
upon from us was modiﬁcation of the manufactur-
ing clause with respect to ratifying countries.
They pointed out that they have been giving full
protection to American works and are receiving
only a very limited protection in return. We have
felt and continue to feel that their point of view
has considerable justiﬁcation if we are to expect
to receive the protection from them which would
be provided by the convention.
The modiﬁcation of the manufacturing clause
which is now being proposed is different in essen-
tial aspects from previous bills to eliminate the
clause to which consideration has been 'ven by
this Committee. The bills before you wou d waive
the manufacturing clause only as to foreign states
which adhere to the convention and would not
become effective as to them until they had done so.
Thus, in waiving the manufacturing clause as to
these countries, we would receive in each case a
substantial quid pt‘o gun in the form of better
copyright protection. Not only would this im-
prove the osition of all creators and users of
oopyrighte material, but it would have the ve
important additional effect of contributing signi -
icantly to the maintenance and strengthening of
our growing foreign market for books and similar
materials.
No change in the manufacturing clause is, of
course, contem lated to permit American authors
to have their oks printed abroad in quantity,
and no change would be made as to countries not
joining the convention.
Support for Multilateral Conventlon
As I have indicated previously, for a great many
years ople in this country interested in im-
prov copyright protection abroad have been
convinced that the best solution for the diﬁiculties
that presently beset the ﬁeld of copyright is partic-
ipation in a multilateral convention which could
be adhered to by most of the free world. I be-
lieve the importance of this convention from the
United States standpoint is amply attested to by
the widespread support which it has among au-
thors, composers, songwriters, and all the creative
artists, as well as amon those who constitute the
media for public dissemination of their creations-—
book and music publishers, and the radio, tele-
vision, and motion-picture industries. It has in
addition the endorsement of committees of the
leading bar associations and of the American Bar
Association itself.
In addition to its importance in establishing
satisfactory copyright protection abroad for
United States nationals, acceptance of this conven-
tion would materially im rove our general foreign
relations with the rest 0 the free world. This is
so because this action would have a highl favor-
able impact on the intellectual and cultura groups
of other countries, particularly in Western Eu-
rope. The successful negotiation of the conven-
tion has been hailed in Europe as the beginning of
a new era in improved cultural relations.
In order that our citizens may have the full
beneﬁts of copyright in foreign markets, and that
the United States may assume a position of leader-
ship in the ﬁeld of international copyright, the
Department wholeheartedly recommends the en-
actment of this legislation.
