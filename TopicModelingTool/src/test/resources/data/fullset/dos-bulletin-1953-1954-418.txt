Greece and Free World Defense
by Henry A. Byroade
Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern, South Asian and African A ﬁaira ‘
As you know from my introduction, my respon-
sibilities in the De artment of State involve the
relations between t 1e United States and the Mid-
dle East, Africa, and South Asia. This huge area
is of utmost importance in the free-world struggle
with Soviet imperialism.
For your part, you are men of business brought
together in this or anization by a speciﬁc interest
in Greece. Since t is ood friend and ally of the
United States falls wit in the area of my concern,
and since the Greek people have been in the van-
guard of the defenders of freedom, I feel justiﬁed
in assuming that we start with many interests
in common.
Anyone who has had close connection with in-
ternational affairs and with the conduct of foreign
policy realizes that the formal dealin between
governments are by no means the beginning and
the end of international relations. Intergovern-
mental exchanges are the surface and the frame-
work. The body of international relations, how-
ever, is made up of private contacts and dealin
which one peo le has with another. Clear] , it
means little i understandings are reache at
ofﬁcial levels which do not penetrate the pri-
vate activities which go on between the peoples
concerned.
It is obvious that United States policies evolved
in Washington cannot be fully realized unless pri-
vate organizations such as the Hellenic-American
Chamber of Commerce, to cite one of many, are
ready and willing to help us give it substance.
Consequently, in talking with you, I speak as
one partner to another. I hope that you will con-
sider my talk from that point of view.
Greek-Amerlean Relations

policy toward Greece. One reason is that the re-
ations between the two countries have remained
on the friendliest basis since the emergence of
Greece as a modern nation in the early 19th
centu . Another reason is that American policy
towar Greece, particularly since the dark da 5 of
World lVar II, has been so clear that it nee s no
restatement. This country has extended and is
continuing to extend direct military as well as
defense support aid to Greece. The gallant Greek
peo le have come through the last decade and a

ﬁeld by immensely superior forces, and subjected
to a ruthless and oppressive occupation, they re-
fused to submit to tyranny. They continued to
resist. IVhen the tyrant was ﬁnally defeated, the
war-weary but undaunted Greek eople set about
clearing away the wreckage left y the ﬁghting,
and restoring both their economic and political
structure.
From the moment of setting out on this path of
return, the Greek eople and Government were
harassed and impe ed by a Communist conspir-
acy, fomented from beyond Greek borders, to turn
Greece into a Communist satellite state. In an
effort to overthrow the established Greek Gov-
ernment, the Communist guerrillas launched a
campaign of terror which threatened the very
existence of the nation and which developed into
a full-scale war. After 3 bitter years, the Greek
Army decisively defeated these foreign-inspired
guerrillas, and gave international communism one
of its most serious setbacks at a moment when the
free world was badly disorganized. Throu hout
this period of trial, the United States was a le to
offer effective help. Military assistance from
America was a factor in the suppression of the
guerrillas. Economic aid helped Greece recon-
struct its economy, and technical assistance of
various kinds contributed to essential improve-
ments in health and sanitation and lifted levels of
production.
