Berlin Rebuilds
ECONOMIC RECONSTRUCTION OF WEST BERLIN, 1948-1953
by Margaret Rupli Woodward
Berlin is a city which has achieved a remark-
able recovery since the dark days of 1948 and the
blockade. Perhaps the most spectacular manifes-
tation of this revival is the creation of about
200,000 new jobs. This has meant an increase of
approximately 20 ercent in the number of em-
p oyed persons. ecause of changes in the pop-
ulation, however, there is much to be done to re-
duce the burden of unemployment. The story of
success despite heavy odds is in large measure the
history of United States supported investment
programs.
Allled Support of Berlln
During the Four Power Conference of J anu-
ary-February 1954, Berlin became for a time a
focal point of world attention. The Allies had
long before made clear the importance they at-
tached to this city. In a Tri artite Declaration
at Paris M. 27, 1952, the nited States, the
United Kingdyom, and France stated :
The security and welfare of Berlin and the mainte-
nance of the position of the Three Powers there are re-
garded by the Three Powers as essential elements of the
peace of the free world in the present international
situation.
When the Four Power Conference ended with-
out agreement to reunify Germany through free
elections, the three \Vestern Governments again
expressed their concern over the effect on Berlin
of a continued division of Germany:
As regards Berlin, the three Governments reaﬂlrm their
abiding interest in the security of the city as expressed
in the Tripartite Declaration of May 27, 1952. They will
do all in their power to improve conditions in Berlin and
to promote the economic welfare of the city.
Berlin has a number of times in recent years
been the center of international attention. All
eyes were on the city at the time of the Berlin
airlift of 1948, during the riots of June 1953, and
again during the food distribution to East Ber-
liners and East Germans in the summer of 1953.
Behind these dramatic outward events, West
Berlin, with the help of the Federal Republic
of Germany and the United States has been
steadily and patiently rebuilding its shattered
economy by means of a series of economic recovery
programs. Outlined below are some of the eco-
nomic programs which have maintained Berlin
as an island stronghold 100 miles inside the Iron
Curtain.
Emergence From the Abnormal Sltuation
of the Airllft
During the period of the airlift in 1948-49, de-
spite a low standard of living compared to present
levels, morale was high with a united determina-
tion to oppose the common danger. Berliners,
workers and emplo ers alike as well as Allied er-
sonnel in Berlin new the camaraderie w ich
comes to those helping each other in times of
cr1s1s.
When the Soviet blockade ended in May 1949,
there came a let-down. West Berlin still lay
in ruins, with most of the city’s industrial estab-
lishments destroyed or dismantled. Economic de-
pression hung over the city. Not only the popula-
tion of Berlin, but refugees from the Soviet Zone
and returning prisoners of war, were seeking jobs,
and at the beginning of 1950, about 800,000 out
of the total population of 2,100,000 (38 percent)
were dependent on some form of public aid. The
picture looked as follows in February 1950:
Unemployed . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 308,000
Wage and salary earners . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 690, 000
Total labor force . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 998,000
Unemployed as % of labor force . . . . . . . . . . . 30. 8%
Meanwhile, production was approximately a third
of 1936, while in the Federal Republic it was close
to 100 percent.
