Conference work was carried on through Execu-
tive, Technical, Financial, and Drafting Commit-
tees. The Executive Committee, composed of
heads of delegations, met brieﬂy the o ening day
of the Conference to a prove rules 0 procedure
and to consider amen ments to the provisional
agenda. Several workin groups and workinr
parties were set up by the inancial and Technica
Committees.
Number and Locatlon of Stations
The Technical Committee agreed early in its
proceedings that, in principle, a lO-station network
was highly desirable in order to provide the de-
sired meteorological services. Based on advice
received from the Financial Committee that the
vessels required to o erate such a network were
not likely to be availa le, however, the Committee
considered various pro osals for a 9-station net-
work. It found that t e following two alterna-
tives were acceptable from the technical point of
View:
(a) Eliminate Station “H” between New York
and Bermuda and retain the other 9 positions sub-
stantially as they exist under the 1949 agreement;
or
(b) Eliminate Station “E” between Bermuda
and the Azores with some adjustment southward
in the locations of Stations “C” and “D.”
May 24, I954
Alternative (a), favored by the United States,
ﬁnally received seven votes in the Technical Com-
mittee against six for the second proposal.
The F inancial Committee, after examining eco-
nomic and general policy aspects of the two alter-
natives recommended a 9-station network with
“H” ellminated. This plan was adopted by the
Conference and forms the basis for the new agree-
ment. Station locations are as follows:
Station Location
A 62°00N
33°00\V
B 56°30N
51°00W
C 52°45N
35°30‘V
D 44°00N
41°00W
E 35°00N
48°00W
I 59°00N

J 52°30)!
20°00W
K 45°00N
. 16°00W
M 66°00N
02°00E
Station “I” will return to the location originally
s eciﬁed in the 1949 a reement, after a minor
0 ange in 1953. The ot er eight stations are to
remain unchanged.
Allocatlon of Responslbllltles
The Conference a ed that the responsibilities
of states should be roadly in proportion to the
beneﬁts derived b them from the existence of the
ocean stations an that the operating costs should
be borne by all states in accordance with these
beneﬁts. It also decided that any difference be-
tween the actual and theoretical responsibility of
states operating ships should, insofar as possi-
ble, be adjusted by cash reimbursements or
contributions.
Civil aircraft crossin s for 1953, the most recent
annual eriod for whic statistics were available,
were ta en as a working basis for establishing the
beneﬁts derived by states from the program.
United States aircraft made 6,463 crossings during
this period, just over 41 percent of the total 0
15,713. This compares with the 64 percent ﬁgure
used in establishing the United States contribu-
tion under the 1946 agreement, and 56 percent for
the 1949 agreement.
In rekus conferences the United States and
Cana a had urged that operating and ﬁnancial
responsibilities be assessed artly on the basis of
beneﬁts derived by states in elds other than trans-
