issue of the American Federationist. By impli-
cation the Soviet representative stated that the
American workers were not allowed to exercise
their civil rights. Now mind you, the charge is
that American workers are not allowed to exercise
their civil rights and the authority uoted was
Martin Durkin former Secretary of abor. If
the delegate of Russia had gone to the library
right here in the United Nations and got the
source information of that article that was quoted
in part in the American Mercury from the Amer-
ican Federationist where it appears in toto, he
would have found that it says instead of American
workers not being allowed to exercise their civil
rights, that the voters of the country do not ex-
ercise their rights enough, that we should have a
larger group voting at any election. And we all
agree on that, unti you get up to the 100 percent
optimum.
I would like to quote one paragraph from Mr.
Durkin’s article:
While this matter [that is, the matter of voting] is
of great concern for all Americans, it is especially im-
portant to trade unions. We know that whatever weakens
democracy also weakens trade unionism, for the ﬁrst
victim of any democratic nation is the trade union move-
ment. The dictators of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and
Communist Russia have followed the identical pattern.
They ﬁrst crush trade unionism and then move on to
exterminate all other evidence of democracy.
That is what the representative of the Soviet
Union should have quoted. He should have read
all of it.
The Soviet delegate in all of his statements,
which are just a crazy uilt of propaganda and
charges, has not denied t at there is forced labor
in Soviet Russia and I doubt that he will deny it.
Neither did the delegate from Czechoslovakia deny
it yesterday in his speech to this Council. Why?
It is part of their laws. The Ad H 00 Committee
on Forced Labor found that forced labor is the
signiﬁcant part of the Soviet structure in both
Russia and the satellite countries, that it is a
political weapon used to throttle freedom.
If conditions are so wonderful in Soviet Russia
and her satellites, then why does your country,
Mr. Tsarapkin, prevent any of your people from
leaving the Iron Curtain area, and why do you
prevent all others except an inconsequential few
from coming in?
Finally, I would just like to conclude by asking
the delegate from Soviet Russia these questions:
First, did or did not Soviet Russia vote against
the resolution of the General Assembly of the
United Nations in December 1954, only 4 months
ago, condemning forced labor as a direct contra-
vention of the solemn obligations of the Charter
of the United Nations? Yes or no.
Second, did or did not Soviet Russia refuse to
answer the questionnaire of the Ad H 00 Commit-
tee which was sent to all countries?
' the allegations received b
Third, did or did not Soviet Russia examine
the Ad Hoc Commit-
tee and forwarded to evict Russia? I will
answer that question, for I would like to quote
from the Report of the Ad H 00 Committee on age
519 (under “Comments and Observations o the
Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Re-
ublics”) : “The Dele ation of the Union of
oviet Socialist Repub ics to the United Nations
resents its compliments to the United Nations
Secretariat and herewith returns, unexamined, the
documents attached to the Secretariat’s letter of
22 November 1952, since these documents contain
slanderous fabrications concerning the Soviet
Union.” New, mind you, they were unexamined
and yet they stated that they contained slanderous
fabrications concerning the Soviet Union. That
evidences a powerful penetration through aper.
Lastly, would or would not the Soviet nion
like to see the whole record of the hearings of the
Ad H 00 Committee made public in all of its shock-
ing detail?
