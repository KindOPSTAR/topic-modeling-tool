U.N. Command Defines Position on Nonrepatriated War Prisoners
Following are the texts of (I) a statement made
by General John E. Hall, United Nations Gom-
mander, on December 23 and (2) a letter from
General Hull delivered on December 28 to General
K. S. Thimag/ya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations
Repatriation Commission, setting forth the United
Nations Command position on the return to civil-
gz'n status of nonrepatriated mm" of war in
area:
STATEMENT OF DECEMBER 23
The terms of reference for the Neutral Nations
Repatriation Commission, signed at Panmunjom
on June 8 of this year‘ as an annex to the armi-
stice agreement which later halted armed conﬂict
in Korea, resolved an issue which alone had pro-
tracted the cease-ﬁre discussions for more than a
year.
The issue was the right of a Pow who resists re-
patriation to seek asylum and of a detaining power
to grant it. This r1 ht is based on respect under
the law for individual freedom and human dignity.
To uphold it the UNC fought throughout the long
and at times frustrating negotiations.
Paragraph 11 of the terms of reference provide
that at the ex iration of 90 days after the transfer
of custody of Il’ow to the Neutral Nations Repatri-
ation Commission, access to captured personnel by
representatives of their original sides shall tenni-
nate. That 90-day period of explanations comes
to an end on December 23.
Paragra h 11 provides that as of the end of the
day of 22 anuary these men will become entitled
to their freedom as civilians. There will no longer
be authority for their custody by the Indian troops.
As civilians they are to be enabled to go to any
available country of their choice. Public state-
ments made by representatives of the ROK and the
National Government of the Republic of China
contain open invitations to the nearly 8,000 Korean
and more than 14,000 Chinese anti-Communists,
respectively, in the south CFI camp to make their
new homes in the ROK and in the territory under
the control of the National Government of the
‘ Baum-m or June 22, 1953, p. 866.
Republic of China. Representatives of these 2
nations are being informed that my command will
use all available facilities to expedite the move-
ment of the individuals who desire to go to those
countries. Under paragraph 11 of the terms of
reference to the NNRC and the Indian Red Cross are
to assist any individual who may wish to apply to
go to neutral countries elsewhere in the world.
It is regrettable that Communist obstructions
have caused disagreements and disru ted the ex-
planations to nonrepatriate Pow. spite the
fact that agreement was once reached concernin
the fundamental rights of these thousands o
prisoners, the Communists have persisted in em-
ploying their habitual frustrating tactics to the
extent that the work of the NNRC has been inter-
fered with and the already difﬁcult job of the
Custodial Force, India, greatly complicated.
With the expiration of this period of explana-
tions, I desire to express my profound admiration
and respect for the Indian troo s. In their unique
and sensitive mission these 0 cers and men have
demonstrated an almost unprecedented capacity
for military ﬁrmness and humane restraint. Their
rigid adherence to mandate imposed upon them by
the terms of reference has earned them the laudits
of all fairminded nations of the world an an un-
shakable conﬁdence in their ability to continue
their duty in the same splendid manner until their
mission is completed some 30 days hence.
