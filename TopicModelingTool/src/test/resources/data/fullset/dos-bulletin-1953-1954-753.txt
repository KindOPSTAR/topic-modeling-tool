And the principle is, of course, the most im-
portant thing. Our main concern, at this stage,
is to establis a sound, mutually acceptable basis
for sharin the water among the states which
claim it. his requires an acknowledgement on
their part that the Jordan and its tributaries
constitute an international river system and that
there must be some kind of understanding as to
who is entitled to how much of the water. Once
this fundamental understanding has been reached
it becomes a question of engineering the dams and
power lants through which the waters can be
put to t ie best use for the refugees and the people
of the states concerned.
Need torflnternetlenal Supervision
Because the political situation in the area
makes cooperation between the Arab States and
Israel im ossible at the present time, the roposed
system 0 waterworks in the valley wouls require
international administration and supervision.
Eventually, if a total valley program became
reality, some kind of vallery water authority,
probably under the United ations, would have
to be created. But here again, once the basic
question of rinciple has been acce ted, the
elaboration o a suitable mechanism or inter-
national supervision would seem to present no
insurmountable difﬁculties.
To my mind, the most interesting aspect of the
whole idea, however, is that it is still alive—not
merely alive but, if I may say so, kicking! Con-
sidering the state of hy ertension in the area at
the present time, no one, east of all myself, would
have been surprised if my original approach to
the valley states had met with a ﬂat and ﬁnal
rejection. But to the contrary—despite many a
misleading news dispatch—the Arab nations and
Israel have shown marked and unmistakable in-
terest. None of them has accepted the r0 osal
yet. But if they have not said yes, neit er ave
they said no—and in that fact, under the cir-
cumstances, there is a genuine basis for en-
couragement.
The Arab countries appointed a special com-
mittee of Arab engineering experts to examine
our original suggestions. Their reactions and
suggestions have now been presented to us and
their report represents serious and constructive
effort to give the idea the consideration it
deserves.
Israel has so far been receptive in rinciple and
noncOmmittal in detail. Our Em assy at Tel
Aviv has just obtained Israel’s comments and re-
actions and they are on the we to Washington,
where we will study them care ully.
Toward the end of this month, after we have
digested and analyzed the reports of Arabian and
Israeli ex erts, it is my intention to return to
the Near ast for further discussions. Through
these ne otiations, it may—and I want to em-
phasize t ie word may—be possible to put together
a workable plan for the Jordan River system
which all of the valley states can accept, despite
continuing political differences between them.
Whether we succeed in doing so or not, Presi-
dent Eisenhower—for I am onl his Ambassa-
dor—will have made an effort edicated to the
proposition that economic stability and social
rogress—a more secure, better standard of life
or people—are the surest and most powerful
bulwarks of peace and freedom in the world. It
is a demonstration of our good will toward all
the nations of the area—a ractical, commonsense,
constructive example of w at the President meant
when he stated our policy to be one of “sympa-
thetic and impartial friendship.”
Visit of Japanese Expert
on Atomic Disease
Press release 254 dated May 14
Dr. Masao Tsuzuki, a noted Japanese expert on
atomic disease, will arrive in Washington on May
16 to consult with U.S. scientists an ofﬁcials of
the Department of State and the Atomic Energy
Commission. Dr. Tsuzuki, who has recently par-
ticipated in an International Red Cross Confer-
ence at Geneva and a medical convention in Ger-
many, will 8 end about 2 weeks here before re-
turning to apan. It is anticipated that Dr.
Tsuzuki will be given access to the best available
U.S. knowledge concerning diagnosis and treat-
ment of radiation illness and cancer. He will have
an opportunity to visit the Brookhaven and Ar-
onne National Laboratories and hospitals in
Boston and Chicago.
Dr. Tsuzuki has had an exce tionally busy and
varied career in medicine. rom 1927—46, he
served as a professor in the Faculty of Medicine
at Tokyo University. He has been distinguished
for his work in oral surgery, chest surgery, and
radiation illness. The latter has been his major
interest since August of 1945 when he was ap-
pointed head of a Japanese Government survey
group to study effects of the A-bomb. At the end
of the Occupation, he was appointed head of a
new Ja anese Atomic Bomb and Casualty Re-
search Committee.
