If this four-power meeting acce ted the Soviet
proposal, we would expose ourse ves before the
world as being morally and olitically bankrupt.
We would have forfeited all) right to the conﬁ—
dence of others in our willingness to fulﬁll our
solemn pledges.
We do not know, we can only sus t, the rea-
sons which rompt the Soviet to ma e its present
pro osal. he reasons given are grotesquely
ma equate.
Grotesque Sovlet Reasoning
It is given as a reason that there is lackin a
treaty with Germany whereby Germany un er-
takes to respect the independence of Austria. It
is said that until that undertaking is given, Aus-
tria must remain occupied.
The Soviet Foreign Minister would have us be-
lieve that during the eriod when Germany is
occupied and totally disarmed—at least in the
Western zones—the danger to Austria from Ger-
many is so great that Austria must be occupied
to protect it against that German danger, but
that once Germany is restored to a uniﬁed and in-
dependent status, with a national army of its
own, then it will be safe to end the occupation of
Austria. Such reasoning will not carry convic-
tion anywhere.
A plausible ex lanation is the fact that article
22 of the treaty 0 peace with Hungary and article
21 of the treaty of eace with Rumania provide
that the Soviet nion may maintain armed
forces on the territory of these countries so long
as this is needed for the maintenance of the lines
of communication of the Soviet Army with the
Soviet zone of occu ation in Austria.
I can understan that the Soviet Union fears a
withdrawal from Austria which would also re-
quire it to withdraw its Red armies from Hungary
and Rumania.
Is it, however, really decent that little Austria
should have to continue to be an occupied state so
that the Soviet Union will have a pretext for con-
tinuing to occupy also Hungary and Rumania‘i
So cynical an attitude will surely shock the con-
science of the world.
We have heard from the Soviet Foreign Minis-
ter many words condemning “militarism,” but
everything which he proposes, whether it be in re-
lation to Germany or in relation to Austria, or
indirectly in relation to Hungary and Rumania,
shows dependence on military power. No con-
:ideration of humanity prevails as against naked
orce.
The Soviet Minister has introduced in his Aus-
trian pro osal a proposal for the four of us to
consider t 1e question of Trieste. That proposal
is unacceptable to the United States. In any
event, it has no proper relationship to the Aus-
trian question. I hope that its introduction does
not mean that it is the intention of the Soviet
Foreign Minister to make a conclusion of a state
treaty with Austria dependent upon the prior so-
lution of all other European questions, so that the
ﬁrst victim of Hitlerite aggression would auto-
matically be the last to be relieved of the conse-
quences of that aggression.
I earnestly lead with the Soviet Foreign Min-
ister to withdraw the two Austrian proposals
which he made yesterday, which, as I say, would
completely revolutionize not only the text but
also the character of the Austrian state treaty.
If he will make that withdrawal, then I have
every conﬁdence that the remaining differences,
which are very slight, can be composed. Then we
could in fact conclude the Austrian state treaty
at this meeting of the foreign ministers and crown
our efforts here with an honorable success.
STATEMENT OF FEBRUARY 14
Press release 70 dated February 16
Mr. Chairman, I have listened attentively to
your presentation and to the proposals which you
submitted. Some of the roposals involve tech-
nical treat changes, and cannot full appraise
them unti I have seen the texts. owever, I
think I have seized the general import of what you
have said.
The Austrian treaty which we are considering
concludin is a treaty which imposes ver heavy
economic urdens upon Austria economic burdens
which we believe are not justiﬁably to be laced
upon Austria. But the Austrian Foreign inis-
ter has indicated that his Government is prepared
to assume these heavy burdens in order to get in-
dependence.
It is the proposal of the Soviet Union as I under-
stand, that Austria should be compelled to make
all these payments and then get nothing in the way
of independence at all. The whole heart and core
of independence is being able, if you want, to have
foreign troops off your soil; or, if you want, to
invite foreign troops to your soil as allies. Both
of these privileges of sovereignty are denied to
Austria by the Soviet proposed treaty, so she will
have paid, and gotten nothing for what she has
paid.
The United States is not prepared to be a party
to trying or to compel Austria to pay a great price
for independence, and then denying that inde-
pendencc.
We believe that would be a fraud, and we are
not prepared to be a party to such a fraud.
The Soviet Foreign Minister makes a very
curious argument. He seeks to justify requiring
Austria to accept for an indeﬁnite period the pres-
ence of foreign troops, which he says are not 00-
cupation troops.
But they certainly are occupying Austria.
