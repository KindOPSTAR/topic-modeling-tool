emergency nature to fend off widespread colla so;
later, it was designed to enable the war-stric en
nations to rehabilitate themselves. The program
of military assistance is another. As the aggres-
sive character of Communist policy became evi-
dent, our own security, as well as that of our allies,
necessitated defensive rearmament. By such
measures as the North Atlantic Treaty and similar
security agreements, and through a vast program
of militar assistance, we have strengthens he
free worl . Another example is our reaction to
the brutal attack on the Republic of Korea. The
membershi of the United Nations rallied behind
American lieadership, fought the aggression, and
met it successfully. These were the acts of a na-
tion which realized the danger of Soviet commu-
nism, which saw that its own safety was tied with
that of others, and which was capable of respond-
inglboldly and promptly to emergencies.
owever, emergency action is costly and emer-
gency measures, no matter how good or necessary
at the time, are not suited to our long-term in-
terests. Moreover, we have grown in strength
together with our allies, and we are no lon er
he pless in the face of overwhelmin force. he
growth of the economic and the military power
of the free nations has partly rectiﬁed the im-
balance of ower between the free world and the
slave worl . The land forces now available to
the free world, although by no means the equal
of the Red armies, are stron enough to discour-
age aggressive adventure. (1 we now possess
the further deterrent of massive retaliatory power.
In the reexamination of our foreign pohcy these
considerations became clearly apparent. The
dangers facing us are no less great and the threat
of Communist aggression remains grave, but the
situation has changed. The difference is the in-
crease in our capacity and the capacity of our
allies. In harmony with the times, therefore, we
are planning, as the Russians plan, for an entire
historical era. The United States must be strong
not only for today, but for all of the foreseeable
future; and we must be strong not only for our-
selves, but for those who today and in the future
look to us for leadership in building their own
strength and maintaining their own security.
We know only too well that the Soviet Com-
munists plan in terms of generations. We know
that their objective is to divide and weaken the
free world, to separate friendly nation from
friendly nation, to force us to overextension until,
as Lenin said, we come to practical bankruptcy.
And the threat which we must meet is the Soviet
strategy that is not limited by a precise timetable.
For us the timelessness of Soviet strategy is of
the utmost importance. We cannot permit our-
selves or the free nations who are associated with
us to be exhausted economically or physically.
Our own economic strength is the bastion of the
free world, and it must be maintained. Accord-
ingly, we have geared our policy for the long
haul. We are well aware t at the cost of our
security effort of the past 3 years, if continued
over the next decade, could bring on an economic
breakdown. Therefore, defense cost must be
brought to a level which is within our capacity
to sustain over an indeﬁnite period.
It is not sound military or economic strategy,
for example, to maintain U.S. land forces in Asia
when our friends and allies in Asia are willing
and anxious to defend themselves, given the mate-
riel and training to enable them to do so.
It is not sound strate to commit ourselves
to the maintenance of mi itary establishments so
vast and costly as to threaten us with bankruptcy
(again as Lenin redicted), when we possess the
massive means of) retaliation to deter ag ression.
However, as Secretary Dulles recent y said,
although a change was imperative to insure the
stamina needed for permanent security, it was
equally imperative that this change should be ac-
companied by an understanding of our true pur-
poses. An sudden and spectacular modiﬁcation
of olicy ad to be avoided. Otherwise, there
might have been panic among our friends and
miscalculated aggression by our enemies.
Maximum Defense at Bearabla Dost
Our Government is seeking a national security
system which will provide the maximum defense
at a bearable cost, and our purpose is to make
our relations with our allies more effective and
less costly. Today we are placin more reliance
on deterrent ower and less on ocal defensive
power. The evelopment of local defenses will
continue but at a more moderate rate than the
emergency pace set heretofore. This has already
been put into effect in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization plan. There, as elsewhere, the
growth of conventional defense forces is calcu-
lated to remain within the defensive policies of
the member nations. President Eisenhower has
announced our intention to reduce the number of
American troops in Korea and at the same time to
equip a corresponding number of Korean divisions.
At the same time he declared that American units
in the Paciﬁc would be highly mobile naval, air,
and amphibious elements. The net result is an
increase in the striking power that can be directed
against any aggressor. This striking power is to
be reinforced with what I have previously re-
ferred to as massive retaliatory strength, and this
strength is centered in a strategic air force capa-
ble of prompt and decisive counterattack at a time
and against a target of our own choosing. In this
reordering of free-world defenses several impor-
tant purposes are accomplished. In the ﬁrst
place, we obtain maximum security at a cost within
our capacity to pay, and thus we insure that our
effort will be endurable and enduring. Next, we
