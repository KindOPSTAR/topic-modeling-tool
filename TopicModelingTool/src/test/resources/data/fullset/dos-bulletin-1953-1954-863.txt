should be replaced by “Asian,” which is analogous
to American, African, European, Eurasian, and
Australian.
Panama-Tokyo Hemisphere
The hemisphere shown at the left in ﬁgure 8 is
centered midway between the city of Panama and
Tokyo (two Paciﬁc ports) on the connectin great
circle route of 7,320 geographical or nautica miles.
Traveling by air from Panama, one crosses the
Caribbean Sea, Yucatan, the Gulf of Mexico, the
United States (passing near Galveston and Salt
Lake City), covering 43 percent of the total dis-
tance before reaching the Paciﬁc Ocean near the
mouth of the Columbia River; then across the
north Paciﬁc and over the Aleutians, crossing the
southern part of the Bering Sea and passing
within 400 miles of Kamchatka before reaching
Tokyo. The white ocean area on the Miller cylin-
drical map at the right is the same hemisphere
with the same Panama-Tokyo great circle route
appearing as a curve. Of the seven Russell-
Kniﬁ'en ‘culture worlds,” this hemisphere em-
braces much of the American and the Oriental,
all of the Polar culture world, and some of the
European.


Figure 5. Part of the Northern Hemisphere
That part of the Northern Hemisphere which is north
of 80" north latitude (approximately the latitude of New
Orleans, La., of Cairo, Egypt, and of Lhasa, Tibet) is
here mapped on a gnomonic or great circle projection,
centered at the North Pole. On this projection, all great
circle routes are straight lines, and all straight lines trace
great circle routes between all points on those lines. The
linear scale increases rapidly outward from the center
of the projection.
Note how many straight lines connecting points named
on the map cross the Arctic Ocean. Also note the ad-
vantages of Thule, in North-western Greenland, in relation
to many of these cities.


Figure 6. The seven major “culture worlds” of Russell
and Knilfen, superposed on a world popula-
tion map on an equal-area projection, each
small dot. representing 50,000 people
These “culture worlds" are: (1) Polar wOrld; (2) Eu-
ropean world not part of Asia; (3) Dry world, both hot
and cold deserts; (4) African world south of the Sahara;
(5) Oriental world; (6) American world; and (7) Paciﬁc
world. The “transition zones" are not represented in
detail on this map. In describing nearly all the maps
that follow, the inclusion or the exclusion of these "culture
worlds" is mentioned.
Moscow-Centered Hemisphere
It may seem odd to include the hemisphere cen-
tered at Moscow (ﬁgure 9) among the hemispheres
including all the United States. But it does
barely include San Diego, Calif. And it includes,
as may be noted on this pair of maps, all of Africa
and Asia, a northeastern fringe of South America,
and much of Indonesia. It therefore embraces
the larger part of the world’s population and all
or much of the larger part of all the seven “culture
worlds” except Latin America and the Paciﬁc.
A North Atlantic Hemisphere
This hemisphere (ﬁgure 10) barely includes all
of North and South America on its western edge—
Cape Horn and the easternmost Aleutian Islands.
Its center proved to be in the north Atlantic, at
28° N. and 31° W., and a great circle through that
point somewhat east of South America passes be-
tween Greenland and Iceland. The western half
of this hemisphere (a mere quarter sphere) thus
embraces all of the land in the so-called \Vestern
Hemisphere, while the eastern half includes all
of Europe and Africa (with most of Madagascar)
and more than 40 percent of the area of Asia. Of
the seven “culture worlds,” only the larger part
of the “Oriental” and all of the “Paciﬁc” are
lacking. Somewhat more about this interesting
hemisphere was presented in my earlier paper
referred to.
