sibility of leadership shall be placed upon this
Nation, we must take the initiative in the develo -
ment of that genuine international understan -
ing on which a cooperative peace must be built.
In these truths I ﬁnd my justiﬁcation for this
appearance before on. The increase of under-
standin and know edge is a task that cannot be
accomp ished solely by our schools or our churches
or from politica platforms. The malignant
germs of misunderstanding and misinformation
are at work in the minds of men 24 hours of every
day. To combat them challenges the study and
the effort of every individual who occupies any
position of inﬂuence on public opinion.
Every newspaper, every magazine, every radio
and television station has the mission of bringing
home to all our people and to as many other people
of the world as we can reach, the facts of emstence
today. But this is not enough.
Need for Balanced Presentation
of human communication also
must help peop e eve where achieve perspective
with respect to facts. uppose the American press
should faithfully report the details of every crime
committed in our country but should be invariably
silent on the apprehension and punishment of
criminals. Would there not soon be created a
universal impression of national lawlessness dis-
order, and anarchy? Facts must be relate one
to the other in truthful perspective. Only within
such framework shall we reach clear decisions in
the waging of the continuous stru gle for a
stronger America and a peaceful world:
Domestic unity and strength as well as inter-
national understanding depend, therefore, in great
part, on the free ﬂow of information and its bal-
anced presentation.
Now I am not suggesting that the cause of do-
mestic unity would be served by any attempt of
yours to slant the news or to turn your news col-
umns into editorials. The consequent loss of pub—
lic respect and conﬁdence would soon destroy the
inﬂuence of the press. But I do believe most
earnestly that the ress should give emphasis
to the things that unite the American people equal
to that it ives to the things that divide them.
News ofg events which divide may be more spec-
tacular than news of developments which unify.
But a free ress can discharge its, responsibilit
to free eop e only by giving all the facts in ba -
ance. acts in perspective are vital to valid citi-
zen judgments. Sound judgment is crucial to
the preservation of freedom. Hence a free press
can sustain itself only by responsibly reporting
all the facts and ideas—the spectacular and the
unspectacular, the unif ing facts and the divisive.
Could not reader-un erstanding be as powerful
a criterion in newspaper ofﬁces as reader-interest?
Need these two qualities be incompatible? I think
not. Certainly, the great journalists of our day,
Every agenc
in critically examining and reporting on a legis-
lative proposal, must inevitably deal with such
constructive questions as: Does it or does it not
tend to sustain our economy, to provide needed
military strength, to increase our understanding
of others or others’ understanding of us? Does
it give us a more secure position internationally?
Does it promise to preserve and nurture love of
liberty and self-dependence among our people?
Does it improve our health and our livin stand-
ards? Does it insure to our children the 'nd of
nation and government we have known?
If proposed laws and policies are described as
mere battle grounds on which individuals or
parties seeking political power suffer defeat or
achieve victory then indeed is the American sys-
tem distorted for us and for the world. If the
fortunes of the individual su porting or opposing
a measure become, in our pu ic accounts, as im-
portant as the principle or purpose of the project
and its effect upon the nation—then indeed are
we failin to develo the strength that under-
standing rings. If t e day comes when personal
conﬂicts are more signiﬁcant than honest debate
on great policy, then the ﬂame of freedom will
ﬂicker low indeed.
I trust you do not view my remarks as an at-
tempt to tell you how to run your own business.
I am, however, willing to take the risk of your
misinterpretation. James Madison once wrote:
“A popular government without popular infor-
mation or the means of ac uiring it is but a
rologue to a farce or a trage y or perhaps both.”
go we are talkin of a problem that the responsible
governmental oﬁicial cannot ignore, just as none
of on can close your eyes to it.
e are not moving toward farce or tragedy.
But knowledge of the facts and of their interre-
lationships is more than ever essential to the solu-
tion of human problems.
I know that to present the facts in perspective
is a diﬂicult task. The haste of living creates
reader impatience. It discourages complete ex—
planation and places a premium upon clichés and
slogans. We incline to persuade with an attrac-
tive label or to damn with a contemptuous tag.
But catchwords are not information. And, most
certainly, sound popular judgments cannot be
based upon them.
On the steady, day-by-day dissemination of com-
plete information depends our people’s intelligent
participation in their own government. For them
that is no light thing. The decisions they must
make are crucial in character and worldwide in
scope. On them depend all the necessities and
comforts of life—from the amount of money in
their pocketbooks, the pavement on their high-
ways, the housing in their towns, to the sort of
country they will leave behind as a heritage to
their children. They need full and accurate in-
formation. Your newspapers can give it to them.
