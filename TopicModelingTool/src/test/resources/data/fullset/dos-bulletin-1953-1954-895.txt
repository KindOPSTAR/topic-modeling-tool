There is another spurious aspect to this so-called
neutral nations supervisory commission. If our
Communist collea ues were really sincere about
impartial supervis10n, there is no reason in this
world why they could not accept a representative
United Nations commission for that task. This
the have categorically and repeatedly rejected,
an we can only assume that they intend to per-
petuate their own concept of a subservient interna-
tional body. The name that they use, “neutral na-
tions supervisory commission,” is uite enough to
convince most of us what they ave in mind.
That name, you will recall, is the name of a body
established in the Korean Armistice Agreement.
In fact, as Mr. Chou En-lai said today, Since an
international organization such as the Neutral
Nations Supervisory Commission is able to super-
vise implementation of the Korean Armistice
Agreement, there is no reason whatsoever why it
cannot carry out appropriate supervision over the
free elections throughout Korea.”
The reason I have asked you to examine this
pro osal with me is because the bitter experience
we ave had with such a body durin the Korean
Armistice has iven us a lesson whic we will not
soon forget. have given evidence on this ex-
erience in restricted session. Mr. Nam 11’s and
r. Chou En-lai’s remarks require me to testify
in this plenary meeting, and it will be proﬁtable
for all of us who are not blinded by political
prejudice.
Let’s take a moment to examine our past and
resent experience with what we, of the United
ations, hopefully acce ted as a so-called “neu-
tral” commission set up y the Korean Armistice.
That commission, you Wlll all recall, consists of
the representatives of Switzerland and Sweden,
countries whose impartiality and neutrality can-
not well be challenged, and of Poland and Czecho-
slovakia, Soviet-satellite countries which are neu-
tral only in the technical sense of nonbelligerency
and which have certainly not shown themselves to
be impartial. The Communist members of this
comm15sion have consistently prevented the com-
mission from carrying out its assi ed function.
As a result of this obstruction the ommunist side
has been able to violate with impunity the provi-
sions of the Armistice. At this very time as we
sit here in Geneva, the aggressors in Korea are
bringing in arms and reinforcements to North
Korea under conditions strictly rohibited by the
Armistice, and the Supervisory Sammission is im-
potent to check these violations because the Com-
munist members of the commission refuse to
permit the commission to act.
The situation has become so intolerable that the
Swiss and Swedish representatives have re-
peatedly protested in writing. In these protests,
which have already been made public, they have
exposed the arbitrary refusal of the Communist
members to emit any activity by the two nu-
inely neutral) members to carry out the so emn
obligation which they assumed when they under-
took their great task. I think it is worth while
to reView some of these reports.
In a letter of May 4, 1954, the Swedish and Swiss
members of the Commission, General Mohn and
General Gross, honorable and able oﬂicers, stated
that “the operations of this commission were ham-
pered by the fact that in many instances the vote
of its four members was found to be equally di-
vided, resulting in a deadlock.” Then they said,
“the control activities of the ﬁxed neutral nations
inspection teams in the territory under the military
control of the Korean People’s Army and the
Chinese People’s Volunteers are not being carried
out satisfactorily and in full accord with the spirit
of the Armistice Agreement, owing to the re-
stricted practices imposed on the activities of the
teams by their Czechoslovak and Polish members.”
Again, in a letter of May 7, 1954, General Mohn
and General Gross said that “all efforts under-
taken by the Swedish and Swiss members of the
inspection teams in order to increase the scope and
the frequency of the spot check controls have been
constantly and persistently frustrated.”
To counteract these honest and impartial state-
ments, as I have said, by the representatives of the
states whose neutrality cannot be challenged, al-
legations have been made that the United Nations
Command has repeatedly violated the Armistice.
These allegations have been made formally and
in writing by the Czech and Polish members of
the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.
Some of them have been repeated here in Geneva.
I should like to read you the reply of the Swedish
and Swiss members of the Commission to these
allegations. In a letter of May 4, 1954, General
Mohn and General Gross, the Swedish and Swiss
members, wrote to the Military Armistice Commis-
sion as follows:
These are some of the comments the Swedish and Swiss
members want to present in order to refute allegations
which they consider to be a tissue of malicious fabrica-
tions, gratuitous distortions, misleading halt-truths, and
delusive insinuations without foundation in reality. The
methods resorted to consist largely in isolating facts and
ﬁgures from their proper context and in making sweeping
generalizations on the basis of premises thus distorted.
There is no denying that the United Nations Command
has laid itself wide open to inspection and observation
by the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams and has never
attempted to conceal anything from the Neutral Nations
Supervisory Commission, not even its mistakes and its
clerical shortcomings. There is no evidence that the
United Nations Command side intentionally or even in-
advertently had violated those provisions of the Armistice
Agreement, the application of which is the concern of
the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. As far as
the Swedish and Swiss members have been able to ﬁnd
the United Nations Command has loyally and sincerely
abided by both the letter and the spirit of the Armistice
Agreement.
