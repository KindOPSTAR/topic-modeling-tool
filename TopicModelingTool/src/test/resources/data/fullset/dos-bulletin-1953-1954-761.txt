Affairs in the Department of State. In addition
to the Department of State and its consular 0f-
ﬁcers abroad, the Immigration and Naturalization
Service of the Department of Justice, the United
States Employment Service of the Department of
Labor, the United States Public Health Service
of the Department of Health, Education, and We]-
fare, the Counter Intelligence Corps of the Army,
and the Treasury Department play an important
part in the administration of the act.
Parts Played by Other Agonelu
In addition to the functions it performs under
the regular immigration laws, the Immi ation
and Naturalization Service ins ects abroa aliens
who apply for visas under the fugee Relief Act
and determines preliminarily their admissibility
into the United States. It is expected that thereby
the number of aliens will be reduced to a mini-
mum who at the time of their application for ad-
mission at a port of entry are found excludable.
The adjustment of status of 5,000 nonimmi-
grants in the United States to that of permanent
resident aliens authorized by the Refugee Relief
Act is also the responsibility of the Immigration
and Naturalizaton Service. The United States
Eneiplgyment Service in cooperation with its aﬂili-
at tate Employment Services examines the
authenticit of {ob orders in connection with as-
surances o emp o ment for refugees and escapees
and also veriﬁes t at no American workers would
be displaced from employment by the alien’s
admissmn.
Abroad, ofﬁcers of the United States Employ-
ment Service will determine the occupatlonal
skills of aliens who are appl ing for visas under
the Refu ee Relief Act an so far as possible
will deve op an occupational catalog of visa ap-
licants with skills for which no assurances have
een 'ven. This catalog will be used in ﬁllin
job or ers in the United States for aliens identiﬁed
on] by their skill b the prospective employers.
he Treasury epartment administers the
granting of loans to ﬁnance the transportation of
immi rants from ports of entry to places of their
resett ement in the United States. Ofﬁcers of the
Counter Intelligence Corps of the Army and spe-
cial ofﬁcers of the Department of State conduct
security investigations concerning visa appli-
cants. The latter, in addition, prepare the written
report on each applicant for an immigrant visa re-
quired by the act.
As I am speaking to you today I am glad to re-
port that the vast machinery to put the act into
full operation in various countries has been set
up as far as conditions permit. At the same time
I would like to give you an insight into the various
problems the Administrator of the Refugee Relief
Program had to contend with before the present
status of the program was reached.
Since the Refugee Relief Act became law on
August 7, 1953, Mr. Scott McLeod, the Administra-
tor of the State Department’s Bureau of Ins ec-
tion, Security and Consular Affairs, appointed r.
Robert C. Alexander as Assistant Administrator to
set up the necessary inter- and intradepartmental
organization for the administration of the act.
The Administrator and his Assistant had to tackle
simultaneously a number of problems. The vari-
ous government agencies entrusted with the act’s
administration had to be brought together and
had to agree on the lines of demarcation of their
respective responsibilities. Regulations, instruc-
tions, and assurance forms had to be pre ared and
discussed within the Government. 'A rst and a
second draft of these regulations and assurance
forms was shared with various voluntary social
a encies concerned with refu ee work, man of
wiom are represented here to ay. Many of t eir
recommendations are incorporated in the ﬁnal
draft of the regulations which were published on
December 3, 1953.2
Simultaneously the Administrator had to re-
solve budgetary questions which by necessity arise
with the inau uration of a new governmental pro-
gram and ha to begin a recruitment program of
consular ofﬁcers and security investigators for
service abroad. This recruitment program had
to be planned carefully so as to conserve available
operational funds as much as possible.
Dll'l'leulty of Antlclpatlng Volume
The uncertainty of the volume of immigration
to be antici ated from different parts of the world
under the fugee Relief Act was, and to some
extent still is, a very serious roblem which has
to be faced in connection with t 1e stafﬁng program.
This uncertainty hinges mainl on two points.
One is that no deﬁnite or ﬁnal sta g plans can be
made for any one country until the government of
such country has declared its willingness to issue
to each emigrant from its territory a certiﬁcate
guaranteeing that he will be accepted back in the
event it should be discovered that he obtained a
visa by fraud or by misrepresenting a material
fact. Although negotiations with the overnments
of the various countries of the wor d in which
the Refugee Relief Program could operate were
initiated soon after the act was approved by the
President, only 10 countries or areas have so far
a reed to issue the certiﬁcate of readmission.
Tiese countries or areas are Austria, Belwium,
France, Germany Greece, Italy, Korea, Holland,
Hong Kong, and .lapan. Greece and Italy agreed
to the issuance of the return certiﬁcate late in 1953 ;
the Netherlands in February; France in March;
Korea, Hong Kongz Germany, Austria, and Japan
in April; and Belglum in May of this year. The
