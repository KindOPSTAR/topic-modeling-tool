In October, on the advice of the National Se-
curity Council, I directed the United States In-
formation A ency to develop programs which
would show t Ie peoples of other nations that the
objectives and policies of the United States will
advance their legitimate aspirations for freedom,
progress, and peace.‘
I believe that if the peoples of the world know
our objectives and policies, they will join with us
in the common effort to resist the threat of Com-
munist imperialism and to achieve our mutual
oals. It Is essential that the United States In-
o_rInation Agency have the tools to carry out this
misswn.
The United States Information Agency will
reach 77 free countries through radio, press, mo-
tion pictures, or information centers and will reach
10 Iron Curtain countries through radio broad-
casts.
My budget recommendations for information
and exchange activities include $15 million of
new obligational authority for educational ex-
change programs. These programs are designed
to promote a rece tive climate of public 0 inion
overseas through t e exchange between the nited
States and over 70 foreign countries of students
and persons who are leaders important to the pres-
ent or future of their nations.
Problems Facing Meeting
of Foreign Ministers
Press Conference Statement by Secretary Dulles
Press release 21' dated January 10
I plan to ﬂy to Berlin on Thursday leaving here
about noon. The President has kindl made the
“Columbine” available to us for the ﬂig t.
My principal assistants will be Mr. Merchant,
Assistant Secretary for European Affairs; Mr.
MacArthur, Counselor- Mr. McCardle, Assistant
Secretary for Public Affairs; Mr. Bowie, Director
of the Policy Plannin Staff; Assistant Secretary
of Defense Frank Nas ; and Mr. C. D. Jackson of
the White House staff. Also, certain U.S. Am-
bassadors and diplomatic representatives in Eu-
rope, including Ambassador Conant and Ambas-
sador Bohlen, will be present in Berlin to assist in
the consideration of those subjects with which
they are primarily concerned.
This will be the ﬁrst time that the four Foreign
Ministers have met since 1949, near] 5 ears ago.“
It will be interestin to see whether ovlet policies
and tactics have 0 anged. In the past, Soviet

leadership has not sought any constructive results,
but rather has sought to divide and weaken the
Western nations. They have tried to stir up
French fear of Germany and German resentment
against France. They have sought to frighten
the Western European nations by picturing the
United States as a militaristic imperialist.
If at the coming conference the Soviet pursues
these same tactics then the conference WIll be a
futility. We will all have wasted our time, and
that applies to the Soviet leaders as well, for the
Western nations are sufﬁciently mature not to be
fooled by tactics of division employed by those
who themselves have consolidated 800 million peo-
ple into a single massive militar bloc. _
If, as we hope, the Soviet lea ers approach this
conference in a constructive mood, they will ﬁnd
us responsive and then there will be plenty to do.
The conference could have large historical sig-
niﬁcance.
Austria needs to be liberated. There is no sub-
stantial obstacle in the way except the will to do it.
Germany needs to be uniﬁed. That can be done
if the four occupyin Bowers pull down the bar-
riers so that a umteg ermany can through free
elections create an all-German government. The
three Western Powers stand ready to do that but
they cannot do it alone. Soviet concurrence is
essential.
I look forward to workin in close association
with Mr. Bidault and Mr. den. All three of
us have had extensive ex rience in postwar nego-
tiations with Soviet lea ers. Our prior talks at
Bermuda and at Paris, London, and Washington
have demonstrated that we think alike. Also our
views are shared by Chancellor Adenauer, with
whom we maintain close contact.
Departure Statement by the Secretary '
We are going to Berlin on a mission which is
difﬁcult, but he eful. We shall need to feel the
moral sup ort o the American people.
This wi I be the ﬁrst time in 5 ears that the
United States with Britain and rance ‘will. be
negotiating with the Soviet Union. The subJect
is the future fate of Euro e. Will Germany and
indeed all Europe be uni ed for peace? Or will
divisions be imposed which will make Europe
again the breeder of war'l
The Berlin conference will not ﬁnally answer
these uestions. But it will go far to indicate
what t e ﬁnal answers will be.
The United States has a great stake in this
matter. Most of us have close ties with Europe
and we share its culture and religion. Many
Americans have died on the battleﬁelds of Europe
to help to save our civilization from being crushed
by the consequences of Euro e’s inner conﬂicts.
This time, we believe that Europe will be rebuilt
