Now it is we who have taken the initiative and
it is our President who has made his statesmanlike
offer. It is accordingly they who stand before the
world as the warlike ones.
In conclusion, I have given you these few illus-
trations, believing that as newspapermen we can
'ziplpreciate the value of having a world forum.
e United Nations is the only real world forum.
If you have an idea which you want to get spread
around the world, the quickest way to get it spread
is through the United Nations. Next to the tall
building, you will see a low rather sway-backed
building which to me resembles a loud speaker.
That is the General Assembly of the United Na-
tions, and if the architect intended it to resemble a
loud sgeaker he had the right idea. And I would
remin you that if we have not got the gumption
and the intelligence and the imagination to use
this loud s eaker, it is our fault and not the fault
of the lou speaker.
All these outbreaks in Iran, in Israel, in India,
in Pakistan, in Korea and elsewhere would rob-
ably have mushroomed into World War I I if
the United Nations had not existed, and if this had
happened, no one can estimate what the cost would
have been in mone and blood. The United Na-
tions, rimitive an evolutionary thou h it is, has
a nota le record of accom lishment— th as an
actual war preventative an as a forum in the cold
war. Let us work together to make it better.
U.S. Economlc Pollcy Toward Underdeveloped Countries
Statements by Preston Hotchlcz'ss
U .8. Representative in the Economic and Social Council ‘
ENCOURAGEMENT 0F STABILITY
U.S./U.N. press release 1896 dated Aprll 7
“Aid—which we wish to curtail;
Investment—which we wish to encourage;
Convertibilit —which we wish to facil1tate; and
Trade—whic we wish to expand”
is the way in which President Eisenhower has
summarized his foreign economic olicy.“
I feel conﬁdent that almost all of ou agree with
each of the four points of this United States policy.
No country, I’m sure, likes to rely on assrstance
from abroad. Most of you realize the beneﬁts
which follow upon a free ﬂow of private invest-
ment and a free exchange of currencies. F urther-
more, I believe, all of you are eager to cooperate in
the removal of artiﬁcial barriers to the increase in
the peaceful trade of the world.
I welcome this opportunity to express my under-
standing of how t 13 policy of the United States
will assist the economic development of the less
developed countries. The United States has al-
ready demonstrated the vitality of its interest in
this development, not merely by words but by
deeds. This is well attested by the scale and scope
‘Made on Apr. 7 and 9 in the Economlc and Soclal
Council.

of our activities in the provision of both ﬁnancial
and technical assistance to the underdeveloped
countries. You may have read in this morning’s
press of our current request to Congress to main-
tain our programs of development assistance and
to increase the rograms of technical assistance to
underdevelo areas. We must now move for-
ward towar conditions in which such extraordi-
nary assistance is not required.
At this session, we have the opportunity of con-
centrating on a special group 0 problems related
to the promotion of economic development. I be-
lieve our work will be facilitated and made more
useful if in our present discussions under agenda
item 3 we keep as closely as possible to the prob-
lems listed under it. As we are all aware, there
will be full opportunity at the next session of the
Council to consider a number of other important
issues in this large ﬁeld which are not scheduled
for consideration at the resent time.
My own remarks will eal with issues raised by
the report of the group of experts on commodit
trade and economic development‘ and the cha -
lenging subject of the international ﬂow of private
capital. The topic of land reform, which is also
listed under agenda item 3, I propose to leave to
committee consideration.
