ing that in January 1954 the Neutral Nations In-
spection Team at Pusan “found out” that ammuni-
tion introduced on board a LST No. 520 was four
times larger than had been notiﬁed by the local
authorities. This information is incorrect. The
Neutral Nations Inspection Team was notiﬁed that
106,617 pieces of ammunition in 23 lots were to be
introduced at Pusan. When proceeding with the
inspection a further lot of 2,655 pieces was made
available for examination. Even with a stretch
of imagination it is hard to realize how the ﬁgure
of 109,272 could be considered four times as large
as 106,617.
In respect to “overreporting” of outgoing com-
bat materiel by the United Nations Command side,
the Czechoslovak and Polish Members claim that
in October 1953, 145 LVT—M4’s and LVT—M5’s
were reported to have been shipped out from
Pusan, whereas the Neutral Nations Inspection
Team only found 74. A special investigation car-
ried out at Pusan revealed, however, that the
Team, for its part, had neglected to report some
of the armoured vehicles involved and reported
others under a wrong nomenclature. Unfortu-
nately, other cases of serious misreporting have
occurred and it would be most unfair to blame the
United Nations Command for such errors.
These are some of the comments the Swedish
and Swiss Members want to present in order to
refute allegations which they consider to be a tissue
of malicious fabrications, gratuitous distortions,
misleading half-truths, and delusive insinuations
without foundation in reality. The methods re-
sorted to consist largely in isolating facts and ﬁg-
ures from their proper context and in making
sweeping generalizations on the basis of premises
thus distorted.
There is no denying that the United Nations
Command has laid itself wide open to inspection
and observation by the Neutral Nations Inspec-
tion Teams and has never attempted to conceal
anything from the Neutral Nations Supervisory
Commission, not even its mistakes and clerical
shortcomings. There is no evidence that the
United Nations Command side intentionally or
even inadvertently had violated those provisions
of the Armistice Agreement, the application of
which is the concern of the Neutral Nations Su-
pervisory Commission. As far as the Swedish
and Swiss Members have been able to ﬁnd the
United Nations Command has loyally and sin-
cerely abided by both the letter and the spirit of
the Armistice Agreement.

Negotiations at Geneva
News Conference Statements by Secretary Dulles
Press releases 309 and 312 dated June 8
KOREAN PHASE
At his news conference, Secretary Dulles was
asked whether he had given up hope of reaching
an acceptable solution of the Korean estion at
Geneva and how much longer he thoug t the mat-
ter should be discussed. The Secretary replied .-
I think that the talks about Korea are pretty
close to the end of their useful life. It is not pos-
sible to express that in terms of days or hours,
because of the fact that talks on Korea are inter-
spersed with talks about Indochina, and there is
often a recess of several days during which there
is no talk at all about Korea.
I believe that there was a talk about Korea er-
haps this morning. I know one was planne . I
have not yet heard whether it was held or what
the result was. But the impression we have here
is that that situation has been pretty well talked
out. Whatever the date may be for winding up
those talks, which, as I say, can’t be forecast bee
cause of the fact that they are dealing with two
problems intermittently, I would say that the
substance of the problem has been fully explored.
Unless, therefore, there is a radical change in the
Communist position, it is not fruitful to go on
discussing that problem much more.
INDOCHINA PHASE
In reply to a question of his assessment of the
Geneva talks concerning Indochina to date, Mr.
Dulles said:
The primary responsibility in those negotiations
is being carried, of course, by the French delega-
tion in association with the delegations of the
three Associated States of Indochina, Viet-Nam,
Laos, and Cambodia.
The United States is playing primarily the role
of a friend which gives advice when it is asked
for, and of course we have a very deep hope that
the result will be one which will maintain the
genuine independence of the entire area and bring
about a cessation of the ﬁghting.
Whether that result is obtainable or not is of
course problematic. It seems that the Communist
forces in Indochina are intensifying their activ-
ities. They have done so ever since the proposal
for peace in Indochina, which was taken at the
Berlin Conference. There has been, I think, a
deliberate dragging out of the negotiations at
Geneva while the Communist military effort has
been stepped up in Indochina itself. The fact
that under these circumstances the Communists
