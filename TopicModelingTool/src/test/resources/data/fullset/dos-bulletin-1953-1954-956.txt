LETTER FROM COMMITTEE T0
SECRETARY DULLES
MAY 18, 1954
DEAR Mn. SECRETARY: Pursuant to the terms of
reference issued on March 5, 1954, by Acting Sec-
retary of State Walter B. Smith, we submit here-
with the Public Committee’s Report.
Your recognition of deﬁciencies needing cor-
rection led to the appointment of this Committee.
It has had the cooperation and active assistance
of ofﬁcers under your administrative leadership.
The fact at once became obvious that administra-
tive reform had to take second place to the de-
velopment of a dynamic foreign policy under the
conditions of acute emer ency that have prevailed
in many parts of the woﬁd. At the same time the
administrative problem was itself made more
difﬁcult because of national bud etary decisions
that compelled the De artment 0 State to absorb
a reduction-in-force o more than 22 percent of its
strength.
The dislocations incident to that reduction and
to the new security measures are disappearing;
the Committee urges that now is the time for
action with respect to the professional service
under your direction.
The fundamental recommendations of this
Committee are two:
(1) To integrate the personnel of the Depart-
ment of State and of the Foreign Service, where
their ofﬁcial functions converge, into a single ad-
ministrative system, thus putting an end to the
institutional separateness of these main function-
ing arms of United States diplomacy.
(2) To im rove and broaden the recruitment
methods of e Foreign Service, utilizing among
other things a nationwide s stem of competitive
scholarships, so as to provi e a steady and ade-
quate ﬂow of ofﬁcer material into the integrated
service—a ﬂow which, at the same time, will be
more full representative, in its excellence and
variety, 0 the best of American youth.
This latter recommendation aside, most of the
reforms proposed in the attached Report, as they
pertain to a. more broadly based and stronger
oreign Service, could have been achieved by an
aggressive administration of the Foreign Service
beginning with the effective date of the Foreign
Service Act late in 1946.
A study of the Foreign Service Ofﬁcer corps’
present strength, insofar as that strength is a
roduct of the Act of 1946, reveals these important
gures :
——-Only 355 ofﬁcers have been examined and ap-
pointed to the beginning ofﬁcer class since No-
vember 13, 1946, and of this number not a
single junior a pointment has been made to the
Service since ugust 1952;
—-Only 51 experienced Government and De-
gzrtmental personnel have entered the Foreign
rvice at higher ofﬁcer ranks as established in
the Act’s lateral entry provision; and
—-—The Forei Service Ofﬁcer corps today num-
bers 1,285, t e lowest strength in the last ﬁve
years. ‘
The Hoover Commission in 1949 and the Sec-
retary of State’s Advisory Committee on Per-
sonnel in 1950 made recommendations on the
subject of strengthening and increasing the size
of the Foreign Service.
These reports did not result in any measurable
action, and it is this Committee’s considered judg-
ment that, had proper and prompt steps been
taken durin those ears, much valuab e time
would have en utilized in developing the For-
eign Service along the lines this Report proposes.
Vigorous administrative action coupled with
full and spirited cooperation on the part of For-
eign Service and Departmental ofﬁcers is essential
to the success of every part of the Public Com-
mittee’s Report you approve.
Over the lon term, the Report places great
emphasis on buﬁding the Foreign Service bgan
annual recruitment conducted nationally for or-
eign Service Ofﬁcers to be commissioned at the
beginning rank and by an intensiﬁed and produc-
tive training and career development program
for all Foreign Service Ofﬁcers.
In order to attain the end u on which there is
agreement in every quarter, t e Committee rec-
ommends a foreign service scholarship pro m
modeled after the successful naval reserve 0 cers’
training plan. The purpose is to insure, so far as
it can be done, a re resentation of every part of
the count in the oreign Service, and to be cer-
tain that t e democratic ideal, long since embodied
in the recruitment of the Foreign Service, may be
even more fully realized.
