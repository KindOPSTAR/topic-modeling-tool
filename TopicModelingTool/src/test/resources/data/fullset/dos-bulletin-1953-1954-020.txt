any nation, in accordance with resolution 5 b)
adopted by the United Nations General Assem ly
on August 28, 1953, can announce before the voting
she does not elect to be bound by her vote on that
particular item. This should facilitate agree-
ment.
The other side insists that talk continue and that
there should be no voting until all nations on each
side are bound. If any one nation’s vote, as a
practical matter is really needed—for example,
uniﬁcation of Korea or withdrawal of foreign
forces—this would, as a practical matter, have to
be worked out before voting took place; so really
we are not too far apart.
Thus we ma have to have some agreement as
to the territorial integrity of Korea and agree-
ment to insure that the troops withdrawn across
the northern border will not return or that other
troops will not cross the border when we withdraw
pursuant to some a ment to be worked out for
hased withdraws of troops at the peace con-
erence.
Do I feel there still is a good chance for a true
Korean peace, or has Panmunjom demonstrated
the futility of a. Korean political conference? I
do believe the Chinese Communists are determined
to keep North Korea politically and economically
integrated into their own economy. The outloo
is discouraging but by no means hopeless. There
is no easy, pat solution. It will take all the brains,
energy, resolution, and patience at our command.
Communists are in no hurry They have no
timetable. They think time is on their side and
that Americans, be' optimistic, friendly, truth-
ful, constructive, amg inclined to believe and to
ho for the best, will become discouraged.
The believe that at a long, drawn-out confer-
ence e American negotiators will be forced by
American public 0 imon to give in, in order to
have a ‘success ul” conference. Impatience
mounts as no progress is reported. People ask,
“What rogress did you make today?”
The ommunists know this and burn bonﬁres
under the American negotiators and utter rude.
insulting, arrogant demands that the American
negotiators stop their unconstructive, stalling
tactics.
The Communist press is completely overnment-
controlled. Ours is free and pray it ever
shall be. The Communists can lan and talk and
vote as a unit. We must marsha facts, argue, and
convince the individual nations on our side. I
wouldn’t have it otherwise. But sometimes it’s
tough to see your best play spilled before it gets off
the ground because someone has unintentionally
revealed the signals.
As against that, consider how much better off
we would be today if the secret agreements with
respect to China, Manchuria, and the USSR
had never been entered into at Yalta without
notice to Nationalist China or to the American
public.
January 4, I954
The issue between us and the USSR. and the
Chinese Communists—slavery or freedom—is
fundamental. There is no easy formula which
can either hide it or solve it.
“'e are ﬁghting to free the minds and souls of
men from communism and we in the free world
must stand to ether in this great ﬁght.
It is not a ght of left against right. It is a
ﬁght for the human dignity of man as a creature
0 God against the Communist doctrine that he
has no value except as the state desires to use him.
0.5. Returns Islands
to Japanese Control
Statement by Secretary Dulles
Press release 871 dated December 24
1. By arrangements concluded today in Tokyo,
the Government of the United States has reim-
quished in favor of Japan its rights under article
III of the Japanese ce treaty over the Amami
Oshima group of the yukyu Islands.
2. Questions have been raised regarding the in-
tentions of the United States with res ect to the
remaining islands speciﬁed in article II of the
peace treat .
3. The nited States Government believes that
it is essential to the success of the cooperative ef-
fort of the free nations of Asia and of the world
in the direction of peace and security, that the
United States continue to exercise its resent
were and ri hts in the remaining Ryulgyu Is-
ands and in tﬁe other islands speciﬁed in article
III of the peace treaty so long as conditions of
threat and tension exist in the Far East.
4. The United States earnestly hopes that prog-
ress can be made in reducing tensions, and we will
spare no effort toward that end. But, until condi-
tions of genuine stability and conﬁdence are cre-
ated, the need of the free nations to preserve an
armed vigilance will remain imperative. It would
be an abdication of responsibility to the common
effort of these free nations, including Japan, for
the United States to adopt any other course than
here set out, since the remaining Ryukyuan and
other islands speciﬁed in article HI of the peace
treaty constitute an eSsential link in the strategic
defense of the whole Paciﬁc area. Accordingly,
the United States intends to remain as custodian of
these islands for the foreseeable future. However,
in exercising its treaty rights, the United States
will not only do all in its power to improve
the welfare and well-being of the inhabitants of
the Ryukyus, but it will continue to safeguard
economic and cultural intercourse throughout the
Archipelago.
