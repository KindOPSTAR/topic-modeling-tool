of the North Atlantic area while a threat to that
area exists.2 The two Governments have further
reafﬁrmed their undertaking to regard any action
from whatever quarter which threatens the in-
tegrity or the unity of the European Defense Com-
munity as a threat to their own security.
You have just seen President Eisenhower’s per-
sonal statement alon this line. Thus, those in
Europe who have heSItated to support the concept
of the Euro ean Defense Community because of
lack of con dence in American and British su -
ort of the European Defense Community shou d
have any last lin ering doubts resolved.
Let me review or a moment what the Euro ean
Defense Community promises, and what mi t be
some of the effects of failure to put it into e ective
operation.
It is a lan which makes it ossible for Germany
to contri ute to its own de ense and to that of
Europe in a Euro ean rather than in a German
national framewor .
It oﬂ’ers the prospect of a stable and effective
European military system which would permit a
practicable defense of central Europe toward
which the United States and other non-European
powers could make a preciable contributions.
It thus holds out t e be e of providing for the
North Atlantic Treaty l(arganization and the
broader Atlantic Community a foundation of
strength on the Continent of Europe.
It is a step toward a state of affairs which would
brin France and Germany into a system which
wouFd at long last make them partners rather than
rivals and in which, therefore, France would no
lon er need to fear an adversarial relationship
wit Germany. This in itself is a development of
vast signiﬁcance—in fact it is one the signiﬁcance
of which could literally be measured in terms of
centuries.
People distin ished for their logic and their
realism can we ope, see that Germans must par-
ticipate in the defense of Germany—that indeed it
would be unjust to France if German nonpartici-
pation caused France to carry an undue part of
the load of combat in the tra '0 event of any
future war. The European De ense Community
thus represents the best way of bringing about a
German defense contribution which is actually
indispensable.
The European Defense Community is a military
system, the control of which rests in the hands of
all its members.
Its establishment would provide effective means
to curb, not to incite, military adventures on the
part of an of its members if, as appears unlikely,
the will or such adventures were somehow to
develop.
On the other hand, a failure to establish the
European Defense Community would be regarded
by the Soviet Union as a victory of epic pro%-
tions for her diplomacy and propaganda. .
' BULLmn of Apr. 26, 1954, p. 819.
Molotov’s refusal at Berlin to take even the slight-
est step leading to a relaxation of tensions in
Europe leaves us no room for doubt that, if the
European Defense Community were to fail, the
Soviet Union would immediatel press forward in
every way to achieve its other 0 ]ectives.
These objectives would certainly include the iso-
lation of each nation of the free world from the
other.
After this had been accomplished the Soviet
Union would use its subversive tactics against each
nation se arately having, of course, as the ﬁnal
goal the estruction of all that nation’s freedom.
The eﬂ'ectuation of the European Defense Com-
munity therefore would be a at step toward
defeating the primary Soviet o 'ectives of divid-
ing the countries from each ot er and of thus
undermining the collective and individual security
of the free world.
The issues which France confronts today are
very difﬁcult and no one who studies them can fail
to a preciate their magnitude. But they are the
kin of issues which a power wieldin real in-
ﬂuence in world affairs must meet. An \Vestern
security eﬂ'orts cannot possibly be successful if
France does not do so. The important role that
France is laying in international affairs today
is because in her noble histo she has met great
issues and her friends not on y wish and hope-—
they are conﬁdent—that she will continue to do
so. The presence and inﬂuence of France are es-
sential to the formulation and support of the kind
of world for which we are striving.
We are now all travelin together along the
road of closer association and cooperation between
European countries, which the foresi ht of French
leaders opened up 4 or 5 years ago. Ve must con-
tinue on this road if Soviet aggression is to be
revented and if a strong Europe is to be built.
For all these great goals France is indispensable.
I have discussed the signiﬁcance of the European
Defense Community to France, to Europe, to the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and to Soviet
expansionism.
Close U.S.-French Relatlonshlp
Let me in closing ask you to look at it from the
standpoint of the United States relationship with
Europe seen in the light of history.
In our histo the importance of France has
been manifest many times. It was ﬁrst shown
when France helped us et our independence.
Then in this centur we imericans have shown
by our actions—by t e solemn fact that thousands
of our young men are buried in France in joint
defense of French soil—how important France is
to us.
In World War I and World War II, we arrived
in Europe after the trouble began. Now we are
there already. We have six divisions in Europe.
