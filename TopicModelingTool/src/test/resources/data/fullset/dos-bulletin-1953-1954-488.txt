If there are further re uests of that kind that
are made, I have no dou t that our military or
defense people will attempt to meet them.
As soon as this press conference is over, I am
meeting with Admiral Radford.1 But so far I
have not met General Ely,2 and I do not know what
requests he has made, if any, in that respect be-
cause that would be primarily a matter for the
Defense people in any case. The policy has already
been established so far as the political aspects of
it are concerned.
We have seen no reason to abandon the so-called
Navarrea plan, which was, broadly speakin , a
2-year plan which anticipated, if not comp ete
victory, at least decisive military results during the
ﬁghting season which would follow the present
ﬁghting season which is roughly a year from now.
As you recall that plan contemplated a very
substantial buil up of the local forces and their
trainin and equipment. It was believed that
under t at program, assuming there were no seri-
ous military reversals during the present ﬁ htin
season, the upper band could deﬁnitely be ac ieve
Japan's Progress and Prospects
by Deputy Under Secretary Murphy‘
In nearly 50 years of its existence, the Japan
Society has been of inestimable value to U. S.-
Japanese relations. Your program of promoting
cultural relations between our two great countries
and in expanding the base of understanding of
Japan in the United States is of service to both
nations. Your work constitutes a genuine con-
tribution to the goals of American foreign policy
in a most critical area. It is much appreciated by
those of us responsible for conducting America’s
foreign relations.
Together with his many American friends, I
extend a warm welcome to our guest of honor to-
night, the new Ambassador of Japan to the United
States, Sadao Iguchi. Ambassador Iguchi’s dip-
lomatic career is one of outstanding service to
his country. We are honored that his Govern-
ment has selected him as its representative here.

There have been no such military reverses, and,
as far as we can see, none are in pros ect which
would be of a character which woul upset the
broad timetable and strategy of the Navarre plan.
Asked whether that ruled out any possibility of
a negotiated peace at Geneva, Mr. Dulles replzed:
At any time if the Chinese Communists are
willing to cut off military assistance and thereby
demonstrate that they are not still aggressors in
spirit, that would, of course, advance greatly the
possibility of achieving peace and tranquility in
the area. That is a result which we would like
to see.
To date, however, I have no evidence that they
have changed their mood. One is always hopeful
in those respects, but so far the evidence seems
to indicate that the Chinese Communists are still
in an aggressive, militaristic, and expansionist
mood.
I ﬁrst met Ambassador Iguchi when I went to
Japan as Ambassador in 1952. He was then
Vice-Minister in charge of the Japanese Forei
Office. I ac aired a profound respect for him
both as an o cial and as a erson. Most of you,
I am sure, will recall his diligent work as Japan’s
chief negotiator for the multilateral Treaty of
Peace With Ja an and his efforts in connection
with the Security Pact between the United States
and Japan. Although I know him to be an un-
assumin and modest man, he can well be proud
of his ro e in these achievements.
Of course, one of the less heralded but, in its
ﬁeld, no less signiﬁcant results in which Ambassa-
dor Iguchi played a leading role in the early
months of Japanese soverei ty was the arrange-
ments by which Japan and gnmerica might beneﬁt
from the interchange of rofessors, students, and
specialists in various ﬁel s. I refer to Ambassa-
dor Iguclii’s considerable part in concluding with
my Government the Fulbright Agreement which
laid the foundations for cultural exchange.
One of the most rewarding experiences of my
career was to serve as my Government's ﬁrst Am-
bassador to Japan on the conclusion of the treaty
of peace. I had never previously served in the
