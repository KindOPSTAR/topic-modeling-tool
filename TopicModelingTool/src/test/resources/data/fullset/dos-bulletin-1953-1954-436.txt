Policy for Security and Peace
by Secretary Dullesl
Since World War II, the United States has
faced the difﬁcult task of ﬁnding policies which
would be adequate for security and peace and
at the same time compatible with its traditions.
Never before has a great nation been called upon
to adjust its thinking and its action so radically
in so short a period.
During the 19th century the maintenance of
peace and order depended argely on Great Brit-
ain, with its Navy and the system of naval bases
which enabled it to operate with mobility and
ﬂexibility throughout the world. By suitable
commercial, investment, and monetary olicies,
Great Britain and other nations with surp us ca -
ital stimulated economic growth in under e-
veloped areas. The French Revolution had
aroused men to respect and promote human rights
and fundamental freedoms. The United States
also made its contribution. Our people devoted
their energies largely to domestic matters, not
because they lacked concern for others but be-
lieving that what our founders called “the con-
duct and example” of freedom would exert a
liberating inﬂuence everywhere. In fact, it did
so. The “great American experiment” was a
source of hope and inspiration to men everywhere,
and especially to those living under despotism.
Our dynamic example of freedom drew many to
our shores and inspired others, in the Old World
and the New, to emulate our course.
All of these inﬂuences contributed to giving
the world relative peace and security for the 100
years between the ending of the Napoleonic wars
and the beginning of the First World War. Dur-
ing this period there were many advances in the
practice of political liberty, and generally
throughout the world there was a great advance
in material and social well-being.
The events of the 20th century, and especially
the two World Wars and their aftermaths, have
created an entirely new situation. In large meas-
ure the United States has inherited a responsi-
bility for leadership which, in the past, has been

shared by several nations. Today there rests
upon us, to a unique degree, the threefold task of
providing insurance against another world war;
of demonstrating the 00d fruits of freedom
which undermine the ru e of despots by contrast;
and of roviding a major part of the effort re-
quired or the healthy growth of underdeveloped
areas.
The Eisenhower administration inherited secu-
rity policies that had much worth. Man of
these policies were bipartisan in character. They
reﬂected a national recognition of the peril facing
the civilized world, a united determination to
meet it, and an acceptance of the role of leadership
thrust on us by events. We had helped to reestab-
lish the economies of other countries shattered
by the war. lVe had taken a major part in re-
SIsting the aggression in Korea. In the face of the
Soviet threat we were engaged in rebuilding our
military strength and that of other free countries.
These and like measures were costly. But they
were necessary to our security. However, they
partook much of an emergency character. By
1953 there was need to review our security plan—
ning and to adjust our continuing military effort to
the other requirements of a well-rounded, per-
manent policy.
Under the conditions in which we live, it is not
east;7 to strike a perfect balance between military
an nonmilitary efforts and to choose the type
of military effort which serves us best. The essen-
tial is to recognize that there is an imperative need
for a balance which holds milita expenditures
to a. minimum consistent with sa ety, so that a
maximum of liberty may 0 rate as a dynamic
force against despotism. at is the goal of our
policy.
The Nature of the Threat
The threat we face is not one that can be ade-
quately dealt with on an emergency basis. It is
a threat that may long persist. Our policies must
be adapted to this basxc fact.
The Soviet menace does not reﬂect the ambitions
of a single ruler and cannot be measured b his
life expectancy. There is no evidence that basic
