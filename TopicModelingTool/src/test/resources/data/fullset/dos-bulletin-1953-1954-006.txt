A Report on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \
Address by Secretary Dulles 1
Last week the NATO Ministerial Council met in
Paris. The United States was represented by the
Secretaries of State, Treasury, and Defense, and
by the Director of the Foreign Operations Admin-
istration. \Ve reviewed the progress made and
we made plans for the future.
This is important business from the standpoint
of the American eople. NATO comes closer than
anything yet to being an effective international
community Olice force. Fourteen nations have
joined toget. ier to create a defensive organization
committed to protect the security of a large area.
This area is vital to the defense of freedom. It
constitutes the rinci a1 home of Western civili—
zation. Also, t e \ astern European part con-
tains coal and iron and industrial plants which, if
they fell into hostile hands, would markedly shift
the balance of power away from us.
All of the 14 member nations have made im-
portant contributions toward building this North
Atlantic Treaty Organization. Many strategic
facilities are contributed by smaller nations. Most
of the forces in Europe are contributed by nations
other than the United States, although there are
approximately six United States divisions, with
air and naval sup ort, now in the European thea-
ter. The United tates has made the largest single
contribution to arming and equipping the NATO
forces. We have put some $11 billion into this
phase of our effort.
The project is so vital and the investment in it
so large that it deserves careful supervision. That
is, of course, the continuing task of our able per-
manent re resentative at NATO’s headquarters in
France.‘ gut also it is important that Cabinet
Ministers from the 14 countries should come to-
gether to talk about NATO and its problems.
The “Long Haul" Concept
We found the Organization in gOOd shape. It
has adapted itself to a new concept which the

D. C.. on Dec. 22 (press release 668).
’Ambassador John 0. Hughes.
United States brought to the NATO meeting of last
April. This was that NATO should operate on a.
budget which the member nations can sustain for
what may be a long period.
When NATO was organized in 1950, many
thou ht that general war might come quickly and
that NATO should build itself up, on an emergency
basis, to full defensive strength. That involved
setting a pace which none of the member nations
could sustain indeﬁnitely.
At the Ministerial Council Meeting of last April,
virtually every member nation was saying that it
could not carry its allotted share of the NATO ro-
gram without large ants of economic aid m
the United States. he total was a ﬁgure which
the United States itself could not indeﬁnitely
support.
It seemed to us that it was justiﬁable and even
prudent now to moderate NATo’s emergency—and
exhausting—pace.
So, at the last April Council Meeting, the United
States put forward a new concept, now known as
that of the “long haul.” That means a steady de-
velopment of NATO, which, however, will preserve,
and not exhaust, the economic and ﬁscal strength
of member nations.
Some feared that this shift, from the mood Of
emergency to that of a steady pace, could not be
made without destroying the morale of the Or-
ganization and leading to its disintegration. Some
felt that what we roposed would be misinter-
reted as a loss of nited States interest in NATO.
Ve knew that the change of pace could not be
safely accomplished except by skillful handling.
But that has now been done. It was made possible
by comprehension on the part of the permanent
staff and the military leaders of NATO. They were
statesmen, as well as soldiers, and they understood
and adapted themselves to the need of taking into
account all of the risks—not merely the military
risks, but also the nonmilitary risks.
Today we can honestly judge that NATO is on
a sustainable basis.
This sustaining basis is one which largely re-
duces the necessity for continuing United States
