Mutual Defense Treaty which is now before you,
and the Korean Foreign Minister and I initialed
the draft text in Seoul on August 7.
At the same time we issued a joint statement
which reﬂected the mutual understandin we had
reached as a result of our discussions. e state-
ment noted that the Armistice Agreement con-
templated that a political conference would be
held with the Communists and that Korean and
United States delegations would cooperate to seek
the peaceful uniﬁcation of Korea as.a free and
independent nation; that the Republic of Korea
would take no unilateral action to unite Korea by
military means for the agreed duration of the
political conference; and that between the date
of the statement and the date when the Mutual
Defense Treaty could be ex cted to come into
force and effect through rati cations, the Armed
Forces of the Republic of Korea and of the United
States would be sub'ect to the United Nations
Command which would comply with the armistice
terms. These understandings between the United
States and the Republic of Korea have been car-
ried out by both countries in ood faith.
I should now like to descri the Mutual De-
fense Treaty itself and to point out some of the
beneﬁts and some of the responsibilities which it
gives to the two signatories. _
The preamble to the treaty recognizes the rela-
tion between the security interests of the Re ublic
of Korea and the United States and states t ie de-
sire of the two countries to strengthen their efforts
for collective defense, pending the develo ment
of a more comprehensive and effective col ective
security system in the Paciﬁc area.
The ﬁrst of the six articles of the treaty afﬁrms
the intention of the Republic of Korea and the
United States to refrain in their international re—
lations from the threat or use of force in any
manner inconsistent with the purposes of the
United Nations or the obligations assumed by
either country toward the United Nations. This
article makes it clear that the treaty is a defense
treaty dedicated to peace.
Article two prov1des for joint consultation be-
tween the Republic of Korea and the United
States whenever the security of either country is
threatened by armed attack. This article also
calls on both countries to employ “self-help and
mutual aid” to develop means to deter armed
attack.
Article three, which is the heart of the treaty,
states that the United States and the Republic
of Korea, in the event of an armed attack in
the Paciﬁc area on either country, will act to
meet the danger in accordance with their consti-
tutional processes. This article constitutes a clear
warning to the Communists that they cannot ex-
pect the United States to ignore a renewed ag-
gression against the Republic of Korea. It con-
tains provisions designed to take account of the
fact that the Republic of Korea has effective con-
trol over only part of Korea; it clearly does not
apply to territories which are not now under
the administrative control of either country or
which are not at some future time recognized by
one party as having been lawfully brought under
the administrative control of the other. If
either country should initiate an armed attack
against any territory not under its administrative
control when the treaty was signed or thereafter
recognized by the other as lawfully brought under
the administrative control of the ﬁrst, the treaty
would not apply. An armed attack by either
country does not obligate the other to come to
its assistance.
In article four the Republic of Korea grants
the United States the right to dispose land, air,
and sea forces in and about the territory of the
Republic of Korea as determined by mutual agree-
ment. It does not require the United States to
do so. Therefore, if agreed peace arrangements
called for a withdrawal of all foreign forces, this
could be done consistently with the treaty.
Article ﬁve requires that the treaty be ratiﬁed
by constitutional process before it shall come into
orce.
The last article, the sixth, rovides that the
treaty shall remain in force in eﬁnitely but that
either country may terminate it one year after
givmg notice.
In summary, then, the treaty is a logical out-
growth of the successful joint effort of the United
States and the Republic of Korea, with the ap-
proval and support of the United Nations, to repel
the Communist invasion of the Republic of Korea.
Its primary value consists in giving the Commu-
nists notice, beyond any possibility of misinterpre-
tation, that the United States would not be in-
different to any new Communist aggression in
Korea. It is our ho e that this reaﬁirmation will,
in combination witi the other measures which
we are taking in the Far East, disabuse the Com-
munists of any ideas of launching another aggres-
sion in Korea.
Beyond this primary consideration, the treaty
also has signiﬁcance as another step in the develo -
ment of a Paciﬁc securit system, adding to tfie
treaties which have alrea y been concluded bv the
United States with Australia and New Zealand,
the Philippines, and Japan. Like these other se-
curity treaties, the Mutual Defense Treaty between
the United States and the Republic of Korea affirms
the belief of the United States that the greatest
measure of security is found in collective commu-
nity measures. As such, the treaty is evidence of
our desire for peace and our conviction that to
maintain peace it is essential to demonstrate, in
concert with other free nations, our ﬁrm and clear
resolve to react to aggression.
Therefore, I recommend that the Senate give
its advice and consent to the ratiﬁcation by the
President of the Mutual Defense Treaty with the
Republic of Korea.
