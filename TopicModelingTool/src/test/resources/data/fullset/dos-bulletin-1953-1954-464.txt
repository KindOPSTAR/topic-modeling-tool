value of total goods and services produced—is less
than $600 a ear, compared to over $2,200 a year
in the Unite States.
The industrial worker in Europe la far behind
his American counterpart in terms 0 what he can
purchase for the work he does. In Great Britain,
or example, in 1953, one hour’s wages bought
about 60 percent of the food that an hour’s wages
bought in the United States. In France, it bought
about 50 percent; in Germany, 40 percent; in
Italy, 30 percent. These comparisons include
certain subsidies and allowances which in some in-
stances sup lement take-home pay, but even with
these added) factors the purchasing power of the
average European worker remains far below that
of his counterpart in this country.
In the less developed areas of the world, the
situation is far worse than in Euro In most
of Asia and the Near East, per capita ross na-
tional product is less than $100 a year. n Latin
America, although there is a wide variation amon
countries, the average is below the levels requir
to support an adequate standard of living.
It is essential to any forward economic move-
ment that eﬁective steps be taken to .improve
world living standards b increasing the real
wages of the worker, an by achievmg higher
productivity and greater output to meet the
ex anding purchasin power.
he United States as consistently encouraged
the efforts of other nations in their work toward
these ends. It has actively supported European
measures to eliminate restrictive practices, lib-
eralize intra-Euro an trade, and create a single
Euro ean market ased on expanded productlon
and ealthy competition. It has attempted,
through its roductivity programs in various
countries of t e world, to insure that the beneﬁts
of increased turnover and greater productive
etliciency are shared equitably with workers and
consumers. Through pilot projects and person-
to-person demonstration met ods, our technicians
have shown practical means b which the farmer
and the worker in the un erdeveloped areas
can improve their methods of production.
These measures, however, cannot do more than
stimulate and reinforce the far ater self-hel
measures of the other nations oﬁlie free worl .
Theirs is the main task of carrying forward the
diﬁicult, but imperative, actions required to
satisfy the needs and aspirations of their peoples.
A Period of Posltlve Actions
The period covered by this report—Jul 1
throu h December 31, 1953—was highlighte by
a num r of noteworthy actions under the mutual
security program:
MILITARY DWSI
Global Military Shipmnts.—A growing sup-
ply of essential military weapons and equipment
continued to ﬂow to our allies in all parts of the
world. Total shipments in 1953 amounted to
$3.8 billion—more than 60 percent hi her than
in 1952, although shipments during t e second
half of the year were running at a somewhat
lower rate than during the ﬁrst half-year eriod.
The cumulative value of military grant-ai ship-
ments from the inception of the military assistance
program in October 1949 through December 31,
1953, totaled $7.7 billion. Almost 50 percent of
this 4-year total was shi ped during 1953.
On a global basis, t e major items delivered
through December 31, 1953, included:
99,444 electronics and signal equipment items.
30,792 tanks and combat vehicles.
176,343 motor transport vehicles.
30,037 artillery pieces.
35,372,000 rounds of artillery ammunition.
601 Navy vessels.
5,340 aircraft.
Almost 2 million small arms and machine us
were shipped, along with about 1,100 million
rounds of small arms and machine gun
ammunition.
NATO Buildup.—The NATO force goals for
1954, agreed upon b the 14 member countries
at the end of 1953, ca 1 for a 5-percent increase in
army divisions, a 15-percent increase in naval
vessels, and a 25-percent increase in aircraft. The
European NATO countries spent over $11.5
billion on defense measures in 1953. To meet the
force goals, these countries plan a moderate in-
crease in their military expenditures during 1954.
This increase follows a more than twofold rise in
ex enditures since Korea.
he combined N A'I‘O forces had grown con-
siderably by the end of 1953. As compared with
Janua 1951, Nero’s active divisions had
more t an tripled, and naval strength had also
been considerably ex anded. Plane strength
had increased more t an 2% times; old-ty e
piston-driven aircraft had been re laced 8y
modern 'ets. Airﬁelds had increase from 15
to more t an 120; more were planned for the next
2 years.
Reinforcing the Military Effort in I ndochinm—
The United States made available an additional
$385 million to reinforce the eﬂort of France and
the Associated States of Indochina, Cambodia,
Laos, and Viet-Nam in the 8-year-old war against
the Communist-led Viet Minh forces. This amount
was in addition to the $400 million previously ap-
propriated by Congress for special ﬁnancial aid
for ﬁscal year 1954. During the latter half of
1953, arrangements were made to channel this
assistance to the Indochina theater of operations
in order to give full support to General Navarre’s
plan for revitalizing the campaign against the
Viet Minh aggressors.
The rate of United States military shipments
to Indochina in 1953 was 50 percent higher than
in 1952. Deliveries under the mutual security
