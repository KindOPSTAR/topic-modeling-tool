integrate their armed forces into a European De-
fense Community. The parliaments of three of
these six countries have already fully approved
this European Defense Community Treaty. And
when all six governments ratify, Western Europe
will then at last have a uniﬁed defense system, in-
cluding a much-needed German contribution, and
NATO as a whole will have a much more solid
foundation based upon the unity of central
Europe.
Once this foundation is provided, then of course,
we can move on to do other things to increase
NA'ro’s effectiveness. We must continue to main-
tain strong and balanced defense forces and to
improve these forces as rapidly as our economic
capabilities permit. We should also continue to
explore the possibilities for closer cooperation in
political, economic, and social matters. Our long-
term aim is an enduring association of free na-
tions, capable of protecting the safety and improv-
in the well-bein of their peo les.
ifs. Scuonn: on say, Mr. ecretary that our
No. 1 goal for the future is lVestern uropzean
unity and it seems that the No. 1 goal of the us-
sians is to try to sabotage that unity. There have
been moves in that direction even on the eve of this
NATO anniversary. Do you think any of those
Russian moves to disrupt Western European inte-
gration will succeed?
SECRETARY DULLESZ I don’t think they will suc-
ceed. The Soviet Union is certainly trying very
hard to disrupt the Atlantic community and to
create divisions instead of union but they haven’t
worked on that very successfully. I had to deal
with that when I was at Berlin at the Four Power
Ministers Conference, at which Mr. Molotov, the
Soviet Foreign Minister, was present. And he
made there quite extraordinary and sometimes al-
most grotesque eﬁ'orts to try to break up the unity
of Europe. He is still trying. You refer to the
fact that a new sug estion along that line was
made very recently. am convinced that the eo-
ples of Western Europe know that in this ATO,
in this European Community, they have some-
thing which 1s a very valuable, a very precious
asset. They know that the reason why the Soviet
Union is trying to break it up is not because the
Soviet Union wants really to protect the freedom
and well-being of Western Europe, but wants to
undermine it. I believe that these maneuvers are
gee? through and I am conﬁdent that they will

Department Views on
Soviet Security Proposals
Press release 189 dated March 31
At Berlin Mr. Molotov, in an effort to prevent
the development of Western European security,
adopted two lines of attack. First, he insisted
that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was
aggressive and should be abandoned. Second, he
proposed, as a substitute, a 32-nation European
security act, from which the United States would
be exclu ed other than as an “observer” along with
Red China.1
These maneuvers were unsuccessful both by the
verdict of the Berlin Conference itself and by the
verdict of free world opinion.
In an effort to retrieve that diplomatic failure,
Mr. Molotov now comes u with new proposals
having the same purpose. e now proposes that
instead of doing away with the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, the Soviet Union should
join it. He also proposes that instead of excluding
the United States from his proposed all-European
security treaty, the United States should join it.
The security of Western Europe is a matter of
direct concern to the Western European countries
themselves. However, since the Soviet Union now
suggests that the United States should be a par-
ticipant in, rather than be excluded from, its new
project, it is appropriate for the United States to
point out that t ese new Soviet proposals are sub-
‘ectlto the basic objections which were raised at
er 1n.
It was there noted that the existing sense of
insecurity in the world was not due to lack of good
romises, for these are all contained in the United
ations Charter. Collective security or aniza-
tions, like NATO, have own up because t ere is
no conﬁdence that all t e members of the United
Nations will observe their covenants. As Secre-
tary Dulles said at Berlin:
These special security arrangements do not have any
words that add anything not already in the United Nations
Charter. The addition which they provide is that they
are agreements between nations which, over long periods
of time, have come to trust and have conﬁdence in each
other. They provide the element of conﬁdence which
unfortunately has not been present on a universal basis.’
The present proposal of the Soviet Union in-
spires no conﬁdence in the face of the continued
iron grip of the Soviet Union on its captive peo-
ples. It is a maneuver to gain admittance within
the walls of the West, to undermine its security.
