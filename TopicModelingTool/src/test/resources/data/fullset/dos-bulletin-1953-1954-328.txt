ied and economicall exploited. It can be said,
however, to the eterna honor of these peoples, that
the would not have had us do other than we did.
ﬁle Austrian bipartisan delegation offered the
Soviet Union every concession compatible with
national honor. They ﬁrmly refused to go beyond
that point.
We were constantly in contact with the Govern-
ment and political leaders of the Federal Republic
of Germany, and we knew that they did not want
us to buy German unit at. the price of making
Germany a Soviet satellite. The Germans under
Soviet rule had no government to represent them,
but we saw them in East Berlin. The provided a
startling and shocking contrast with t e people of
West Berlin. There we saw open countenances and
everywhere welcoming smiles and estures. In
the Soviet Sector of Berlin we saw on y frozen and
haggard countenances, as the ople stood silently
under the vigilant eyes of ﬁll): ever-present and
heavily armed police. A few waved at me from
behind a policeman’s back, and many wrote me
through underground channels. Thev made clear
that they passionately wanted uniﬁcation with
West Germany, but they did not seek that uniﬁca-
tion on terms which would not really have ended
their own enslavement but would have merely ex-
tended that enslavement to their brothers of the
West.
The alien peoples under Soviet rule can know
that nothing that happened in Berlin has made
less likely the uniﬁcation of Germany, or the libera-
tion of Austria and indeed the restoration of free-
dom to Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the other sat-
ellite countries. At Berlin I did not conceal my
views in this res ct. In m closing remarks to
the three other oreign Ministers, I said, “We do
not believe that the peoples of Germany or Aus-
tria or for that matter of other neighboring na-
tions need to bury their hopes.”
I am conﬁdent that in saying this I expressed
the abiding sentiments of the American people.
The Governments of France and Britain re-
'ected, without hesitation, the Soviet protl'er of
uropean “peace” at a price which would have
meant Western European disunity in the face of
the huge consolidation of Soviet wer.
Thus it came about that, in re ation to Europe,
much has been revealed. The Soviet has offered
its alternatives to Western planning, and they are
so repellent that there seems no choice but to
roceed as planned. Certainly that is the United
tates conviction.
Atomic Energy Talks
I had two private talks with Mr. Molotov about
advancing President Eisenhower’s atomic energy
plan.‘ We have agreed on the next procedural
step which will involve communication between
Moscow and Washington through the Soviet Em-
bassy in Washington. I should note in this con-
nection that the Berlin Conference adopted a
resolution to exchange views on limitation of
armament as contemplated by a United Nations
resolution of last November.‘ It was, however,
made clear that these talks would not replace, or
cut across, the independent development of Presi-
dent Eisenhower’s atomic energy plan.
Aslen Questions
We dealt also with the matter of peace in Korea
and Indochina.
We wanted a political conference on Korea be-
cause we felt it a duty to ourselves, the Korean
ple, and the United Nations to seek to replace a
gdlea divided by an armistice with a Korea united
in ace. The Korean Armistice recommended
sue a conference with the Communists.’ But for
over 6 months the Communists had blocked agree-
ment upon either the time or place or com ition
of that conference. As far back as last ae tem-
ber, in agreement with President Rhee of orea,
the United States had pro d that the confer-
ence be held at Geneva. at proposal had been
rejected. We pro osed, also in agreement with
President Rhee, t at the conference should be
composed of Communist China, Soviet Russia,
North Korea, and, on the United Nations side, the
Republic of Korea and the 16 United Nations
members which had fought in Korea. This pro-
posal had been rejected. The Communists insisted
that a grou of Asian “neutrals” should be present
and that goviet Russia would be among these
“neutrals” and so not bound by conference
decisions.
We were able at Berlin to settle all these matters.
It was agreed that a conference will be held at
Geneva, as we had long ago proposed, and that
the composition will be precisely that which the
United States, the Republic of Korea, and the
United Nations General Assembly had sought.
There will be no Asian “neutrals” there.
No Recognltlon of Red China
Some profess to fear that the holding of this
conference will imply U.S. recognition of Com-
munist China. That fear is without basis. Those
throughout the world who sug est that the pros-
pective Geneva conference imp ies recognition are
giving the Communists a success which they could
not win at Berlin. The resolution adopted at
Berlin explicitly rovides—I shall read the text—
“It is underst that neither the invitation to,
nor the holding of, the above-mentioned confer-
ence shall be deemed to imply diplomatic recogni-
tion in any case where it has not already been
accorded.“
