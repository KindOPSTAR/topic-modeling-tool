Hold-Over Committee, writers of this petition, who are
empowered by the Marshallese Congress, to act in its name
when it is not in session and which is in turn a group
of members representing all the municipalities in the
Marshalls, due to the increasing threat to our life, liberty,
happiness and possession of land, do hereby submit this
petition to the United Nations with the hope that it will
act on our urgent plea. Thus, we request that:
1. All the experiments with lethal weapons within this
area be immediately ceased.
2. If the experiments with said weapons should be
Judged absolutely necessary for the eventual well being
of all the people of this world and cannot be stopped or
changed to other areas due to the unavailability of other
locations, we then submit the following suggestions:
(0) All possible precautionary measures be taken be-
fore such weapons are exploded. All human beings and
their valuable possessions be transported to safe distances
ﬁrst, before such exp10sions occur.
(b) All the people living in this area be instructed in
safety measures. The people of Rongelab would have
avoided much danger if they had known not to drink the
waters on their home island after the radio-active dusts
had settled on them.
(0) Adequate funds be set aside to pay for the pos-
sessions of the people in case they will have to be moved
from their homes. This will include lands. houses and
whatever possessions they cannot take with them, so that
the unsatisfactory arrangements for the Bikinians and
Eniwetak people shall not be repeated.
(d) Courses be taught to Marshallese Medical Practi-
tioners and Health-Aides which will be useful in the
detecting of and the circumventing of preventable dangers.
We would be very pleased to submit more information
or explain further any points we have raised that may
need clariﬁcations.
The Marshallese people who signed this petition are on
the following sheets, divided in the following manner:
The ﬁrst group are members of the Marshallese Congress
Hold-Over Committee. The second group are some of
the many interested Marshallese citizens. The name of
each person appears on the left hand side and his or her
home atoll and occupation on the right hand side opposite
the signature.
If more signatures are needed we will promptly supply
them. The only reason we are not supplying more now
is because to do so would mean a delay of some three
months, the time necessary to make complete circuit of
our far-ﬂung atolls and islands by ship.
[Signed by 11 members of the Marshallese Congress
Hold-over Committee]
