Slgniﬂcanee of Allied Landing
in Normandy
Statement by the President 2
White House press release dated June 5
This day is the 10th anniversary of the landing
of the Allied Expeditionary Force in Normand .
That combined land-sea-air operation was ma e
possible by the joint labors of cooperating nations.
t depended for its success upon the skill, deter-
mination, and self-sacriﬁce of men from several
lands. It set in motion a chain of events which
aﬁected the history of the entire world.
‘ No. 10534; 19 Fed. Reg. 3413.
'Read by Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., on
June 6 at Utah Beach in Normandy. Mr. Lodge was
the President's personal representative at a ceremony
marking the anniversary of the Normandy landing.
Despite the losses and suffering involved in that
human effort, and in the e ic conﬂict of which
it was a part, we toda ﬁn in those experiences
reasons for hope and inspiration. They remind
us particularly of the accomplishments attainable
through close cooperation and friendship among
free peoples striving toward a common goal.
Some of my most cherished memories of that cam-
paign are those of friendly cooperation with such
distinguished military leaders of foreign nations
as Field Marshal Montgomery, Admiral Ramsay,
Marshal of the Royal Air Force Tedder, Marshal
Delattre de Tassigny, Marshal J uin, and Marshal
Leclerc. I recall my pleasant association with
the outstanding Soviet soldier, Marshal Zhukov,
and the victorious meeting at the Elbe of the
Armies of the West and of the East.
These lessons of unit and cooperation have
by no means been lost in t e trying period of recon-
struction since the ﬁghting stop ed. Rather,
we see peoples, once bitter enemies, burying their
anta onisms and joining together to meet the
problems of the postwar world. If all those
nations which were members of the Grand Alli-
ance have not maintained in time of peace the
spirit of that wartime union, if some of the peoples
who were our comrades-in-arms have been kept
apart from us, that is cause for profound regret
but not for despair. The courage, devotion, and
faith which brought us through the perils of war
will inevitably bring us success in our unremit-
ting search for peace, security and freedom.
Memorial Day Observance at Cherbourg
Memorial Day ceremonies took place on May 30
at Cherbourg, France, as in other communities
around the world where American war dead are
buried. U. S. Consul A. G. Heltberg was the prin-
cipal speaker at the observance, which as in pre-
vious years was sponsored by the city p overnment.
In reporting to the Department of tate on the
day’s events, Consul He tberg noted one “peculiar
aspect” of the Cherbourg observance:
The Cherbour cemetery contains only 4 Ameri-
can graves—all ating from the Civil War. They
are the raves of sailors who died in the battle be-
tween t 1e U. S. S. K earsage and the Confederate
ship Alabama, which was fought on June 19, 1864,
within sight of Cherbourg.
