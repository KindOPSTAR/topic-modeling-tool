Over recent years the fearful problem of deal-
ing with Soviet expansion has brought many to a
truly disturbing emotional and moral state. In
a sense brains have been washed to such an extent
that many are tempted to trade principles of
justice for some sense of momentary respite.
Our ultimate reliance is not dollars, is not
guided missiles, is not weapons of mass destruc-
tion. The ultimate weapon is moral principle.
George Washiﬁgton, in his Farewell Address,
called upon our ation to observe justice toward
all others. “It will” he said, “be worthy of a
free, enlightened, an , at no distant period, a great
nation to give to mankind the too novel example
of a peop e always guided by an exalted jus-
tice. . . . The experiment, at least, is recom-
mended.”
That recommendation has, in fact, guided us
throughout most of our national life, and we
have become the great Nation which Washington
foresaw. This is not the moment to forsake that
guiding princi le. It is not a moment to ﬂee from
opportunities ecause we fear that we shall be
inad uate. If what we stand for is right, why
shoul we fear?
There are some in Euro who would have us
forsake our friends in Asia in the hope of gain
for Eurofpe. There are some in Asia who would
have us oisake our friends in Europe in ho e of
in for Asia. We dare not be critical of t mm,
or they are subject to strains which we are spared
by our fortunate material and geographical posi-
tion. Indeed, there are some Americans who
would have us sacriﬁce our friends both in Asia
and in Europe for some fancied beneﬁt to our-
selves.
I do not argue that American foreign policy
should be conducted for the beneﬁt of others.
American foreign policy should be designed to
promote American welfare. But we can know that
our own welfare would not really be promoted
by cynical conduct which deﬁes moral principles.
In a world in which no nation can live alone, to
treat our friends unjustly is to destroy ourselves.
We must stand as a solid rock of principle on
which others can depend. That will be the case
if we follow George Washington’s advice and
continue to be a people who are guided by “exalted
justice.”
Secretary Dulles Returns
From Berlln Conference
Press release 88 dated February 23
The following remarks were made by Secretary
Dulles on February 19 upon his return from the
Berlin Conference of Foreign Ministers:
I am glad to be back from the Berlin conference.
For 4 weeks the United States has been battling
there for the principles of freedom in which our
people believe.
We didn't make any progress in uniting Ger-
many or in liberating Austria, but the debate there
had a tremendous value in revealing that the So-
viet Russians had not changed their purposes.
They are not willing to let go their grip anywhere
and they would like to extend their grip if they
could.
Our European allies stood ﬁrm with us and we
believe that the prospects for European unity are
increased by the Berlin disclosures of the Soviet
purposes.
Our Far Eastern discussions led to agreement on
a conference to unite Korea, as had been agreed on
at the armistice. The terms for this conference
are 100 percent what we wanted. The place and
composition of the conference are precisely what
we have sought. No neutral will be present and it
was expressly stipulated that no recognition of
Communist China is involved.
I shall be reporting early this week to the Presi-
dent and the Congress. And I plan a radio and
television talk to the Nation next Wednesday
night.
lnvltatlons to Korean

Preaa release 97 dated February 26
The State Department on February 24 extended

standing reached by the four Foreign Ministers at
Berlin, under which the Soviet Union would in-
vite the Chinese Communists and North Korea
and the United States would invite the Republic
of Korea and the other 13 nations which, with
France and the United Kingdom, participated in
the Korean hostilities on the United Nations side.
As the quadripartite Berlin communique pro-
vides,1 representatives of the Four Powers will
decide and invite the interested states for discus
sion of the problem of Indochina at Geneva.
