'20. Further, the commission in pursuance of its
function and authority to interpret the terms of
reference, is of the view that the alteration of the
status of POle either by declaration of civilian
status or disposition in any other manner requires
the implementation of the procedures of explana-
tion and political conference to recede it; such
procedures being pursued to their egitimate termi-
nation as prescribed in the aforesaid terms, unless
the two commands agree on alternative procedures
or courses of action in regard to status and dis-
position of I’Oll's. Any unilateral action by any
party concerned will not be in conformity with the
said terms of reference.
21. In adopting this course the commission is
persuaded by its earnest desire to further the pur-
oses of the armistice agreement, to conform to
awful and impartial procedures within the con-
text of the eXisting Situation, to avoid possible
outbreaks of violence and to act in conformity
with the purpose and spirit of the Geneva Con-
vention relating to the treatment of POle.
:22. I venture to express the conﬁdent hope that
the respective commands will be persuaded by the
same desires in the further steps each of them will
take in relation to the status and disposition of
the POWs who will soon be restored to their
custodv.
23. I am grateful to the UNC for the renewal of
its assurance that it is prepared to assist the com-
mission until the time of its dissolution and desire
to assure them that it has endeavored to discharge
its obligations with objectivit ' and t0 the best of
its abilities. I shall be grate ii] for your reply to
this by the 16th of January 1954.

SWISS MEMBER'S STATEMENT
-\t today’s meeting of the NNRC, the chairman,
General Thimayya, has informed the Commission
of two letters intended to be sent to the two com-
mands, proposing the restitution of the POle to
the former detaining sides prior to 23 January.
After the rejection of the Swedish proposal of
11 January,’ which was supported by the Swiss
member of the Commission, regarding the declara-
tion of transfer of the POle to civilian status,
the Swiss delegation, notwithstanding certain le-
gal objections, is, on principle, prepared to agree
with restitution of the POWs to both commands
for humanitarian reasons. However, in the view
of the Swiss delegation, the Nxac has, contrary
to the opinion expressed in the above-mentioned
letters, no right to declare the restitution of the
' Not printed.
PO‘Vs dependent upon the condition that no al-
teration in their status be made or that the trans-
fer of the POll's shall have no effect on their ﬁnal
disposition. As a matter of fact, the Commission
has never taken such a decision.
The Swiss delegation disagrees with these two
letters. The chairman has decided to send them
in his own name and on his own responsibility.
SWEDISH MEMBER'S STATEMENT
The chairman of the NNRC has today, in his own
name and on his own res onsibility, written to
the Commands of both si es proposing the res-
toration of the POVVs remaining under the cus-
tody of the anc to the respective commands from
which they were received.
As the Swedish proposal regarding the abso-
lute dut of the Nxac to declare the relief from
the PO\ ' status to civilian status of such remain-
ing prisoners on January 22 was rejected by a
majority of Nxac, and as there appears to be no
possibility of reaching agreement Within the anc
on the ﬁnal disposition of the prisoners of war,
the Swedish member thought it reasonable that
the prisoners should be restored to the former de-
taining sides.
The Swedish member objected, however, to the
motivations contained in the said letters on the
grounds that they gave the impression of being
the unanimous view of NNRC, whereas in almost
all cases they represented, in fact, the opinion of
the chairman onl , or of a majority of the Com-
mission, compose one way or another.
GENERAL HULL'S LETTER OF JANUARY 16
I have read your letter of 14 January in which
you )ropose to nest the United Nations Com-
mand to accept tie restoration of custody, be-
ginning at 0900 hours, 20 January, of those
prisoners of war given over to the _Neutral Nm
tions Repatriation Commission by this command.
In my communication to you of 6 Janua , the
position of the United Nations Comman was
stated clearly. That position has not and Will
not be changed, since it is founded on both the
spirit and the letter of the terms of reference
which embody the factors of humanity and justice
for the prisoners themselves and the recognition
of their inalienable right of freedom of choice.
It is recognized that Communist intransigenoe
made it impossible for the Neutral Nations Repa-
triation Commission fully to aecom lish its mis-
sion under its a reed terms of re erence. The
United Nations ommand in good faith turned
over the risoners of war in its custody to the
Neutral ations Repatriation Commission, with
conﬁdence that each prisoner would be given full
