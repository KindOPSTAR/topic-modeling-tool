This position is as valid today as it was nearly 2
years ago. The United Nations needs Japan and
apan needs the United Nations. Let us ho e
that the Soviet Union will soon recognize tlie
barrenness of its osition and vote to admit Japan
to its rightful p ace among the members of the
United Nations. ,
Until such time as its admission becomes a fact,
Japan is maintaining its interest in the work of the
United Nations through its permanent observer
delegation.
Japan is a member of the International Court
of Justice, of the International Monetary Fund,
and of the International Bank for Reconstruction
and 'Development. It is a member and is on the
Council of the Food and Agriculture Organiza-
tion. Other specialized agencies to which the
countr belongs are the International Labor
Organization, the International Telecommunica-
tion Union, the Universal Postal Union, the \Vorld
Health Organization, the International Civil
Aviation Organization, and the World Meteor-
ological Organization. Japan is also an associate
member of the Economic Commission for Asia
and the Far East.
J a an’s active participation in the International
Nort Paciﬁc Fisheries Commission, for which
provision was made in the International Conven-
tion for the High Seas Fisheries of the North
Paciﬁc Ocean, demonstrates Japan’s cooperation
with Canada and the United States in the sphere
of ﬁsheries conservation. The ﬁrst meeting of
the Commission was held in Washington last
month. Discussions centered around organiza-
tional matters and research programs on ﬁsh of
common concern to the three countries.
U.S.-Japanese relations were further cemented
last Christmas Day, when control of the Amami
Oshima Group, the northernmost of the Ryukyus,
was relinquished to Japan.
Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement
The Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement
si ed last week at Tokyo is, in the view of the
Lnited States, a logical step in im lementation
of the Security Treaty between the nited States
and Japan, which became effective simultaneously
with the Treaty of Peace on April 28, 1952. You
will recall that the preamble to the Security
Treaty states that the United States is “. . .
willin to maintain certain of its armed forces
in an about Japan, in the expectation, however,
that Japan will itself increasingly assume respon-
sibility for its own defense. . . .”
The Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement
provides the basis for the grant of assistance pur-
suant to the mutual security legislation of the
United States. It takes us nearer to the time
when we shall be able to withdraw our forces
from Japan. The agreement signed last week is
not unique. It is one of a series of such agree-
l ments that the United States has me otiated with
sovereign nations throughout the wor d. In effect
this agreement makes Japan a full member of
the free world team.
In planning a program to assist Japan in
strengthening its defenses we recognize that an
essential element for consideration is its economic
stabilit . We shall also rovide a milita assist-
ance a visory group to elp train the t apanese
forces. This agreement represents an important
step to redress a situation which at one time saw
Japan completely defenseless and entirely under
the protection of United States forces.
Of course, the Soviet Union has attacked and
will continue to attack this step toward safeguard-
ing the integrity of Japan as a threat to itself.
Sometimes one may wonder how naive the Com-
munists think the rest of the world may be; when
their lpower drive smashed down across the 38th
paral el and ravaged the Republic of Korea, the
source of aggression in A51a was immediately
apparent.
Aim of Communist Aggresslen In Korea
And, further, it was clear that South Korea was
not the main Communist target. The Commu-
nists were aiming at Japan. By occu ying the
Korean Peninsula, the aggressors would ave held
the historical dagger aimed at Japan’s heart.
When the United Nations stalled this move, the
immediate Communist threat to Japan was
checked. In this breathing spell, Japan and the
United States are working together to guarantee
that any such future threat will not ﬁnd Japan
unprepared.
ow that Japan has joined with the United
States in a Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement,
the question naturally arises: “What does this
mean with regard to the evolution of regional
security in the Paciﬁc i”
In some quarters, questions arise as to why we
have not gone ahead and organized a. Paciﬁc pact
as we did for the North Atlantic community.
Such questions miss the problem entirely.
As you know, the United States is on record as
favoring a re ional security arrangement in the
Paciﬁc. We eel that the menace to the free world
by international communism is great.
However, one does not bring such organizations
as NATO into being with a wave of the wand.
NATO, like any regional security agreement,
evolves from a set of essential conditions. A pri-
mary condition was a common recognition of a
common peril from without. Another condition
was the habit of cooperation that had evolved
over a period of many years. A third condition
was the conviction shared by all that the security
of each could only be achieved through collective
action.
Clearly, unless these conditions obtained in the
North Atlantic community, it would have been
