sulted with the State and Treasury Departments,
requested the cooperation of brokers and dealers
in refraining from eﬁ'ectin transactions in all
securities of such origins. rading was restored
in Italian securities in December 1917 and in
J a anese securities in November 1950.
March 1951, followin the announcement by
the Government of the Fe eral Republic of Ger-
many (West Germany?l of its reco ition of re-
war external debts of t e German Igerich, the om-
mission, having consulted with the Department of
State, advised that it did not intend to withdraw
its request that brokers and dealers refrain from
effecting transactions in German securities until
full assurances could be given to investors, through
validation proceedings, that only securities which
constitute ‘ ood delivery” would be afforded a
market in t 1e United States. This action was
necessary because of the large volume of German
securities, particularly foreign currency bonds,
reacquired by the Germans and held in negotiable
form in Berlin, which were lost or looted after the
occupation of Berlin in 1945 by the Soviet armed
forces. In September 1952 and April 1953 the
Commission again requested brokers and dealers to
refrain from effecting transactions in German se-
curities pending the establishment of appropriate
validation procedures.
The Federal Republic of Germany has enacted
legislation requiring the validation of foreign cur-
rency bonds and certain internal securities and
procedures for validation have been or are being
established.1 The Agreement on German Ex-
ternal Debts signed in London on February 27,
1953, provided that the Federal Republic would
permit the settlement of certain debts, includin
German foreign currency securities, and woul
provide the necessary foreign exchange to permit
payments on debts which are settled. Validation
]S a necessary step before a bondholder may par-
ticipate in a settlement which may be offered pur-
suant to the agreement of February 27, 1953. An
exchange offer has been made by the Federal Re-
ublic with respect to certain issues of the German
Reich and the Free State of Prussia and an issue
of the Conversion Ofﬁce for German Foreign
Debts. It is understood that further exchange
offers are being negotiated.
Negotiations in the case of dollar bonds issued
or guaranteed by West German states or munici-
pahties are being conducted by the Foreign Bond-
holders Protective Council, Inc., 90 Broad Street,
New York 4, N. Y., and negotiations in the case of
other German dollar bonds are being conducted by
the United States Committee for German Corpo-
rate Dollar Bonds, 910 17th Street, NW., Wash-
ington 6, DC. Inquiries concerning these matters
should be addressed to the Foreign Bondholders
Protective Council or to the Committee for Ger-

man Corporate Dollar Bonds, whichever is
appropriate.
The procedures for validation are not identical
for all securities. Under an agreement dated
February 27, 1953,2 entered into between the
United States Government and the Federal Re-
ublic of Germany, a joint German and American
Board has been established in this country to vali-
date German dollar bonds, and registration of
such securities for validation began in September
1953. In addition, under the provisions of a
treaty betwwn the Federal Republic and the
United States signed on April 1, 1953,8 no Ger-
man dollar bond subject to the validation laws
of the Federal Re ublic is enforceable unless and
until it has been va idated.
In addition to the problem of validation, the
Commission has been concerned with obtaining
for investors recent information about the various
issuers of German dollar securities. Such infor-
mation is considered desirable in connection with
the resumption of trading in such securities. In
November 1952 the Commission initiated steps
through the Government of the Federal Republic
looking to the furnishing of current information
by the German issuers. Such information about
the Federal Re ublic is now available in a circu-
lar dated Octo er 6, 1953, which relates to the
exchange offer which it is now making. Copies
of the circular may be obtained from the exchange
agents: J. P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated, 23 IVall
Street, New York 8, N. . and Dillon, Read &
Co., 48 \Vall Street New i’ork 5, N. Y. Since
information about the other German issuers had
not been furnished, the Commission in November
1953, after consultation with the Department of
State, sent direct requests to 63 issuers of German
dollar obligations and again requested the assist-
ance of the Government of the Federal Republic.
As a result of such efforts, 13 German issuers ‘
have transmitted to the Commission copies (in the
German language) of their annual reports, but
the remaining 50 issuers have so far failed to send
information. The annual reports on hand are
available for public inspection in the Commission’s
Washington oﬁice and, where sufﬁcient copies have
been received, are also available for public inspec-
