This NATO system is looked on as an essential
element in United States policy.
For 1955, the amount of new authorizations and
appropriations required for our contribution to
NA'ro’s defensive strength will, I am glad to say,
be much less than heretofore. This is due to the
fact that a revision in force goals under the new
strategy, the substantial progress that has already
been made in equippin and training NATO forces,
and greater efﬁciency has enabled us to meet our
past commitments at less cost than had been esti-
mated.

Any consideration of NATO is incomplete with-
out a consideration of the present status of the
European Defense Community. NATO needs a
German contribution and, above all, it needs a
F ranco-German unity which will end, for all time,
what has been the world’s worst ﬁre hazard. The
French proposed to gain these ends by uniting
six continental nations, including France and Ger-
many, to create a new community whose armed
forces, drawn from each member nation, would,
in Europe, replace national forces.
By next month it will be 2 years since the treaty
to create the E00 was signed. So far ratifications
have been completed by three of the parties,
namely Belgium, the Netherlands, and the \Vest
German Re ublic. Ratiﬁcation by a fourth coun-
try, Luxem ourg, may occur very soon. In the
case of France and Italy, the parliamentary rati-
ﬁcation process has not yet begun, but early dates
for that ma soon be set.
These de ays constitute a negative factor from
the standpoint of the free world. They delay
the capacity of NATO to draw on Germans for
buildin the strength needed to implement N A'I‘O’S
forwar strategy. Also they prevent \Vest Ger-
many from joining the family of sovereign free
nations. This is ecause the treaties restore
sovereignty to the West German Republic are by
their terms contingent on E00 coming into force.
There is, of course, a duly elected West German
Government. But it is not yet a sovereign gov-
ernment.
It is obvious that the present status cannot con-
tinue much longer.
During the past year the NATO defense system
has been supplemented, so far as the United States
is concerned, by a base arrangement with Spain.
This will enlarge in an important way the facili-
ties available to the United States air and naval
craft in the Western Mediterranean area. This
has been desired for a long time. Now the nego-
tiations have been successfully concluded. This
represents an addition to our overall security. It
will, however, call for an item of appropriation.
Economic Aselstanoe
Another encouraging development during the
current car is the increase in the economic well-
being 0 our European allies. Generally speak-
ing, their living standards have risen, their cur-
rencies are stronger, and the people feel a greater
conﬁdence in their future.
Their international position from the stand-
point of balance of payments has also improved,
and the balance is now moderately favorable to
them. This result has been assisted by our oil'-
shore procurement program, which enables Europe
to earn dollars by manufacturing some of the mi i-
tary supplies which we need. Also, we have
'ven dollars to France on account of her expend-
itures in Indochina.
The creation of a more healthy economy in
Europe is due in considerable measure to the
adoption, this year, of the “lon haul” concept
for NATO. The prior program 0 rapid military
buildup was demonstrably not within the eco-
nomic capabilities of the member countries. The
new program involves less quantity but more
quality.
By the use of methods of greater selectivity,
and b increased dependence upon new strategy,
it will’be possible to maintain a steady increase
of defensive capabilit without military costs
which our Euro ean allies could not carry without
great economic elp from the United States.
We do not believe that even the United States
can prudently make vast economic grants a per-
manent part of its policies.
We have sought to eliminate economic aid in
Europe as pure budgetary support. Exce tions
are where this is necessary to maintain m1 ita
establishments which directly beneﬁt us and which
cannot be maintained to the degree deemed desir-
able by our military advisers without some support
from the United States.
The case of Turkey illustrates this point. Tur-
key maintains about 20 divisions of splendid
ﬁghting quality at a strategic location. The
Turkis economy cannot sup ort this without
some assistance and, therefore, the mutual security
program makes provision for this. We believe
that the money spent in this way brings a greater
return to the United States in terms of its own
security than if it were spent in some other way
or if it were not spent at all.
There are, in the program, some items of eco-
nomic aid not related to direct military beneﬁts.
This is particularly the case in relation to Asia
and Latin America. In most cases the amounts
are small. The largest single economic item, out-
side of Korea of which I shall speak later, is $85
million to be recommended for India. India’s
foreign policy differs from our own. But free-
dom accepts diversity. The Government of India
is carrying on a notable experiment in free gov-
ernment. It provides a striking contrast with
