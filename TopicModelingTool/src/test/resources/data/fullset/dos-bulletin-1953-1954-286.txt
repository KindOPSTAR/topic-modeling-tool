International Cooperation
in Fisheries Conservation
by Walter S. Robertson
Assistant Secretary for Far E astern Aﬂ'az'rs 1
I am most happy on behalf of the United States
Government to welcome you to Washington to
this, your ﬁrst meeting.
Our Canadian friends are frequent and honored
visitors to this city on matters of ﬁsheries conser-
vation. The many joint ﬁshing concerns of the
United States and Canadian Governments, on
both the Atlantic and Paciﬁc shores, bring our
scientists and administrators together with fre-
quency; and it is as always a pleasure to greet our
collea es from Canada.
An on this occasion it is a very special pleasure
to welcome our friends from Ja an. This is, I
believe, the ﬁrst international con erence in Wash-
ington in which the Government of Japan has
participated since the war. More than that, in
this meetin Japan now joins as a partner, with
the United tates and Canada, in a cooperative re-
search and conservation pro ram for the ﬁsh stock
of common concern in the orth Paciﬁc Ocean.
On both these grounds, I repeat our eat pleasure
in welcoming the representatives oghe Japanese
Government.
The subject with which you are concerning
yourselves, the conservation of high seas ﬁsheries
resources, is a question in worldwide ferment to-
day. Twomonths a o the subject was before the
General Assembly 0 the United Nations, but no
ﬁnal solution was reached.
There are two op osing schools of thought as
to how the continue productivity of marine re-
sources may best be assured.
One school of thought takes the view that na-
tional jurisdiction or sovereignty over the high
seas is a necessary condition for such assurance.
If this theory were laced in effect and if it be-
came international aw, there would be no free
seas in the sense that we know them now.
The other school of thought maintains that,
within the concept of the free seas, the conserva-
tion of ﬁsheries resources can be carried out in-
telligently and effectively b making use of con-
servation measures such as t ose developed in the
North Paciﬁc Fisheries Convention. The means
for such conservation are primarily cooperative
and coordinated research and joint use of our
scientiﬁc knowledge on an international basis.
Under this principle the high seas remain free.
Governments a ee jointly to undertake scientiﬁc
research in big seas ﬁsheries where needed and
jointly to undertake ﬁshing-control measures when
science shows them to be desirable. The essence

the International Commission for the North Paciﬁc
Fisheries at Washington, D. C., on Feb. 1 (press release

of this approach is international cooperation to
make it possible for mankind to derive the great-
est possible beneﬁt from the resources of the high
seas.
Your Commission, gentlemen, is a working
example of this second, and, as I believe, forward-
looking school of thought. Operating under this
latest and most advanced conservation treaty, you
will carry on under principles which are in some
ways new in the practice of international conser-
vation. The world will observe your activities, not
only from the test of your success in the scientiﬁc
study and mana ement of the reat North Paciﬁc
ﬁsh stocks, but a so as a test 0 high seas ﬁsheries
conservation under the concept of the freedom of
the seas. I wish you every success.

In joining with our colleagues of France and
the United Kingdom in submitting the redraft
before us,’ my Government wishes its views to be
clearly understood as to purpose.
Together with our cosponsors we have earnestly
and patiently sought here to give to General Ben-
nike’ the clearest and least complicated terms of
reference for undertakin the task of reconcilia-
tion which we have out ined in the new para-
graph 11.
As indicated by my colleague from the United
Kingdom, we have sought most honestly and sin-
cerely to meet the wishes, views, and objections of
the parties to this dispute and of other interested
members of the Council. During these negotia-
tions we have been impressed with the unhappy
divergence of views of the parties as to their in-
terests, rights, and obligations under their own

follows:
"Requests and authorizes the Chief of Staff to explore
possibilities of reconciling the Israeli and Syrian interests
involved in the dispute over the diversion of Jordan
waters at Banat Ya’qub, including full satisfaction of
existing irrigation rights at all seasons, while safeguard-
ing the rights of individuals in the Demilitarized Zone,

Agreement as he may deem appropriate to effect a rec-
onciliation ;"
