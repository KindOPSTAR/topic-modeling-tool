The obstacles to taking pro erly into account
the ra idly changing relations tween people on
a wor dwide scale are twofold: (1) political and
institutional and (2) physical and technical.
Political and lnstltutlonal Roadblocks
It is not only the United States but also most
of the other nations of the world that are experi-
encing global relations for the ﬁrst time in their
history. And the political and institutional dif-
ﬁculties in the way of each nation’s adapting it-
self to the new worldwide relationships are very
great. It is not peo le but the inadequacies of
political institutions dating, of course, from pre-
atomic ages) that now constitute the chief road-
block to effective coo eration as world citizens, in
the opinion of Maj. en. G. Brock Chisholm, well-
known Canadian sychiatrist who was until
recently Director- eneral of the World Health
Or anization. He notes that there is need of ﬂex-
ibi ity to permit quicker and freer decisions in
international affairs by heads of government,
without danger to democratic processes. It may
therefore be well to reexamine what ought to be
done in the national interest to adapt each nation’s
institutions and procedures to the necessities of
eﬂicient operation on a worldwide scale. What
national constitutions and legislative procedures,
in fact, have et been conceived with a view to
assurin relatively rompt and responsible action
in colla oration wit the overnments and peo les
of other nations? Dr. isholm adds that t ere
is a need of expert international civil servants,
who should not sacriﬁce any of their national
allegiance, and that their training is more exacting
than that of domestic civil services.
Another serious roadblock to development of
normal world relationships is wides read fear.
It is no lon er wild animals we fear ut our fel-
low men—w at they may do to us, what they think
we think. There is xenophobia—fear and dis-
trust of foreign peoples, ideas, and products.
Men overned y fear become victims of a sort
of “p obiocracy’—rule by fear and by “phobio-
crats.” Strangely, the fears among nations are
greatest in those that possess the weirdest pri-
mordial cosmic powers of destruction of one an-
other and of everything they cherish on earth.
It sometimes seems that vast new human ener-
gies would be released if we were to nourish faith
in the integrity of the universe and its Creator, in
the sound principles enunciated by our forefathers
in each of our culture worlds, and in the ability
and desire of many of our fellow men of all lands
to rise above the inane excesses of nationalism that
sometimes seem to threaten to engulf us all.
Physical and Technlcal Obstacles
Many physical and technical difﬁculties must be
overcome before we can effectively and easily
visualize geo aphical relationships that can be
perceived rea istically only on glo es. Mechani-
cally it is easy to pr01ect pinpoints of light repre-
senting stars upon a lanetarium dome and thus
study the precession o the equinoxes, eclipses, and
movements of the planet “wanderers” among the
ﬁxed stars. But it is much more diﬁicult to project
continuous coasts, rivers, and geo aphical dis-
tributions and to superpose one set 0 geographical
data on another.
For example, there is thus far no practical
means of resenting a globe, or of projecting onto
a screen t e appearance of a globe, with subject
matter on it, in a lecture room or, what seems to
be technically very different, on a television
screen.
But the time must come, I believe, when anyone
studying relationships, let us say, between two
points 5,000 or more miles a art, or involvin an
area as lar as one-tenth o? the earth’s surﬁwe,
will norma ly turn to a lobe supplemented by
transparent measuring andgcomparing devices that
will make it easier to use a lobe than a map.
The writer’s most usefu? present unoﬁicial re-
sponsibility, in his own estimation, is serving as
c airman of the National Research Council’s
“Committee on Construction and Use of Precise
Globes and Spherical Maps,” which is working on
a comprehensive program—thus far solely with
government funds, but we hope later also with
private funds, especially in the educational ﬁeld.
Study of Techniques
The study of many categories of geographical
phenomena on the global surface presents striking
difﬁculties. Printing population distribution,
cost- and time-distance data, and many other sub-
jects on globe gores and mounting them on globes
seems, at the moment rohibitive in cost. Pro-
jection from lantern sli es onto spherical surfaces
may prove most economical but necessitates en-
tirely new techniques involving special lenses and
projection apparatus and perhaps projecting onto
concave surfaces.
Research and development in problems of globe
production include determination of means of
making globes more accurate and uniform, of
transparent materials best adapted for use as
spherical overlays and means of imprinting geo-
graphical and geometrical patterns upon them,
and means of projecting global distributions onto
a dome analogous to a planetarium. The total
cost may be several hundred thousand dollars.
In any event, a whole generation in all parts
of the world should learn, soon, to think in truly
“global” terms. Large as the earth may seem
to us and complicated though its problems be,
we dare not exclude any people or any region
