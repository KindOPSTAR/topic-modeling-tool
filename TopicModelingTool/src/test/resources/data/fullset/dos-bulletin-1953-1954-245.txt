prohibits its intervention in domestic matters (ar-
ticle 2, paragraph 7). Your representative at the
United Nations is called Ambassador by act of
Congress, for the simple reason that he represents
a sovereign state and not a olitical subdivision.
It would, of course, be a mani est absurdity to give
the lar e and small states each one vote in a body
which ad the powers of a government.
It is not a heavy burden on the United States
taxpayer—16 cents per citizen in Year 11 of the
Atomic A e. This is less than half of what is
spent for t e sanitation of the city of New York,
or one-fourteenth of what is spent for cigarettes.
The amount s ent, according to the New York
Times ﬁgures, y the United Nations, foreign del-
e ations, and secretariat members living in New
ork far exceeds our annual contribution to the
United Nations and the specialized agencies—and
the American contribution was reduced both in
percentage and in actual dollars at the last session
of the General Assembly.
It does not threaten the destruction of our Con-
stitution because, as the Sn reme Court has said,
“the treaty makin power oes not extend as far
as to authorize w at the Constitution forbids.”
There is only one organ of the United Nations
which can take action which is legally binding.
That is the Security Council and there the United
States is com letely rotected by the veto. None
of the other t ings t e United Nations can do are
an thing but recommendatory.
t is not a nest of Communist spies, because
there is nothing to spy on in the United Nations—
which is why the Soviets haven’t even ﬁlled their
quota of employees. N0 United States citizen em-
ployed by the United Nations has ever been pros-
ecuted for espionage. Eve United States citi-
zen employed there will within a few months have
been screened in accordance with a Civil Service
Commission-FBI plan. With so many good
Americans to choose from there is no justiﬁcation
whatever for employing a single American in the
United Nations who is a Communist.
It is not a snare which dragged the United
States into the Korean war. The United States
took the initiative in getting the United Nations
to take action against the Communist aggressor
1n Korea.
It is certainly not a device which has had an
unbroken record of successes. Far from it. It
did not prevent the Communist victory in China.
Neither did the United States. Communist suc-
cesses in other parts of the world have taken place
in spite of the United Nations. Yet it not on]
survives but actually functions helpfully, though
imperfectly, in spite of the fact that the Commu-
nist bloc is in a cold war with the rest of the world.
Its Future
The need _for the United Nations is sure to
grow as rapldly as science progresses. Today,
none of the 60 nations comprisin the United Na-
tions is able to maintain itself a one—except for
the Soviet Union, which does it by harsh slave
labor. The United States cannot exist without
supplies far in excess of what we produce here.
If we were denied as few as 20 essential materials
we would be completely crippled economically.
The whole of North America, with guided mis-
siles and atomic weapons, can be crlplpled mili-
tarily. Maybe it was ossible to get a ong with-
out a lace like the nited Nations in the days
when t ie 4%-day boat to Europe was the quickest
way to travel across the seas, although even in
those days we got into two world wars. But a
place like the United Nations is as necessary now
in international politics as an airport in inter-
national travel.
It is erhaps because of this need that the
United ations, with all its faults, has been able,
more than any other body in modern history, to
organize peace and security—in spite of the great
threats to peace and security at large in the world.
This is, undoubtedly, why war would be inevi-
table if the United Nations disappeared.
If war came in spite of the United Nations, it
would then be the indispensable instrument for
repelling the ag ession—which is probably one
reason why the ommunists don’t leave it.
This explains why men of good will throughout
the world would be straining every nerve to create
even the imperfect device which we have now if
the United Nations did not exist.
Therefore there is a need for the United Na-
tions, a need as real as the yearning of mankind
no longer to send its sons of! to slaughter.
Three questions have been raised in the United
States with regard to the United Nations, and
satisfactory answers to these questions must be
iven.
g One concerns the loyalt of United States per-
sonnel 0n the payroll, and:7 as I have said, within
a few months every American employed there will
have been screened in accordance with the Civil
Service Commission-FBI plan.
The second is that the Soviets used the United
Nations to ﬁght their cold war battles whereas
the United States did not. This situation does
not exist in the United Nations today. We fol-
low the policy of actively usin the United Na.-
tions as the one eat world éorum for inter-
national resentation and rebuttal. At the last
session 0 the General Assembly we used it as a
place in which the big truth could be used to
demolish the big lie.
To give a few examples, Dr. Charles Mayo of
the Mayo Clinic, who was an American delegate,
made a smashing demonstration of the diabolical
falsity of the Communist charge that the United
States has been using germ warfare in Korea.
Other delegates focused the spotlight of world at-
tention on forced labor behind the Iron Curtain
and on treatment of World \Var II prisoners of
