The time available to us for this study has been
extremely short, but we have ressed our work to
earl termination because of t e obvious urgency
of t e matters involved.
We submit this report without waiting for
rinting of the documentation repared by the
ICommission’s extraordinarily a le staff. This
material will be published as promptly as possible,
and will be issued in the form of a supplement.
Very truly yours,

INTRODUCTION
As directed by the Act of Congress under which
our work has been undertaken, and guided by a
sense of heavy responsibility, the members of the
Commission on Foreign Economic Policy have
endeavored faithfully to re-examine the interna-
tional relationships of the United States in the
economic ﬁeld, as they bear upon the soundness of
our domestic economy and the security of our
citizens.
Dominating our thinking throughout, has been
the soberin realization that the policies pursued
and the actions taken by the United States in re-
spect to foreign economic policy profoundly in-
ﬂuence the destinies of all of the peoples of the
world. Our Nation bears an awesome responsibil-
ity of world leadership. Though not of our
seeking, it is one that we may be fated to bear for
a long time to come. If we bear it with under-
standing, courage, and honor, we can make incal-
culable contributions to the cause of peace and the
advancement of human welfare.
In our discharge of this responsibility, we shall
ﬁnd at times that our views w111 differ from those
held by other free eoples. On such occasions
we must dis lay for earance, but never falter in
the high qua ity of our leadership.
Nor can we forget that the security and well-
being of our own citizens are constantly at stake
as we take signiﬁcant steps in foreign economic
policy, though the effects of such decisions may at
times seem remote to the individual, or difﬁcult of
evaluation.
The res onsibility which rests upon the Presi-
dent and t e Congress to make wise decisions, and
to take them promptly, is grave indeed.
How then s all our Government determine what
is wise in the ﬁeld of foreign economic policy?
Ours is clearly one of the most dynamic, the
most resilient, the most creative economies in the
world. Never has it seemed more powerful than
it is today. What, therefore, could be wiser than
to determine what are the sources of that strength,
and then to build upon these as we play our part
in the international economy?
The strength of our domestic economy requires
adherence to three fundamental principles:
1. The freest ossible op ortunity for the de-
velopment of in ividual talgnts and initiative in
the utilization of private resources and through
the free association of workers.
2. The maintenance of vigorous, but fair, oom-
petition.
3. The maintenance of a broad free market for
goods and services.
Our primary reliance should therefore be upon
the incentives of the free enterprise system, the
stimulating effects of competition, and the stabiliz-
in inﬂuence of free markets.
In moving toward a fresh release of these ex-
pansive forces, here and abroad, we must not ex-
t to repeal history. The present fabric of our
ifvcvs, the obligations which we have assumed under
the necessities of national defense, the customs and
traditions of our people, the basic protective stand-
ards of our laws that safeguard wages, commerce,
industry, and agriculture, must all be res ected.
Where changes are required they must em-
barked upon gradually, with every precaution
possible taken to avoid dislocations in our present
systems of production, and distress to individual
citizens.
Changes when made must take us toward recog-
nizable goals. \Ve must know what we are seek-
ing to achieve and advance steadily and intelli-
gently toward those known objectives. We must
avoid the instability of the im rovised.
Boldness will be required. e have outgrown
some former practices.
The larger interests of all our people must at
all times be our standard of conduct.
Responsible behavior on our part, moreover,
requires that we recognize our own limitations and
restrict our commitments to our capabilities. Our
ﬁrst obligation to the world, as well as to our-
selves, is to keep the United States stron . Only
from that ﬁrm base shall we be able integligently
and worthin to measure up to our great responsn
bility in world leadership.
That from our own resources we have already
poured out vast sums to help reconstruct a war-
torn world, and to further our own security, is
common knowledge. But the extent to which
there still exists a serious distortion in our eco-
nomic relationships with the rest of the world is
not so clearly understood.
Basic, therefore, to any survey of our foreign
economic problems is an analysis of the so-called
dollar gap.
THE POSTWAR DOLLAR PROBLEM
During the period 1946 through 1953, the
United States transferred to the rest of the world
through gifts and loans $33 billion of goods and
services, exclusive of military items. This total
