peatedly violated the terms of the Korean Armi-
stice Agreement. It has disregarded international
rules on the care of prisoners of war. In order
to secure sorely needed foreign exchange to carry
on its aggressive adventures and its subversive
activities in other countries, it has engaged in
narcotics trade throughout the world and has
directed an extortion racket against overseas
Chinese whose relatives on the mainland are at
its mercy. In addition to its aggression in Korea
and its deﬁance of the United Nations itself, it
has supplied the Communist Viet Minh armies
with equipment and advisers and trained Viet
Minh troo s on Chinese soil. It has swe t aside
traditiona local autonomy in Tibet and as car-
ried on an active program of intimidation and
subversion throughout Southeast Asia.
Internally, the Mao regime is a ruthless police
state with all that that implies. Millions of
Chinese have been murdered or have committed
suicide in connection with the phoney land re-
forms and the campaigns against alleged irregu-
larities of private businessmen. Property of
both Chinese and foreigners has been conﬁscated
without compensation. Personal liberty is a thing
of the past. The “justice” of the so-called peo-
ple’s courts is subservient to state policies. Move-
ments of individuals are closely controlled. There
is forced labor on a large scale. Children are
trained and forced to inform on their parents and
friends. There is not even freedom of silence,
since all must be vocal in support of Communist
policies. Mass “brainwashing” is a continuous
process through daily study groups and all media
of communication. The family unit has become
a. special tarﬁet of the Communist system. The
Communists ave rewritten history and attempted
to make religion the handmaiden of politics.
In view of all these considerations it is hardly
surprising that the ﬁrm policy of the United States
Government is one of strong 0 position to the
Chinese Communist regime. e cannot reco -
nize this regime, and we shall continue vigorouSIy
to oppose attempts to accept it in any United N a-
tions organlzation as representing the Chinese peo-
le. We earnestly solicit the su port of the entire
rec world in these policies. e would view with
deep concern a. “creeping acceptance” of the
Peiping regime by t 6 world community of
nations.
We further consider that recognition and ac—
ceﬂptance of the Peiping regime would have the
e_ ect of substantially weakening the will to re-
s1st Communist expansion on the part of other
Asian people. The nations and people near the
Chinese mainland might under such circumstances
erroneously tend to view communism as “the in-
evitable wave of the future” and more and more
incline their political leanings and economic ac-
tivities to accommodate this conviction. If the
Chinese Communist regime were the only China
to which the 12 million overseas Chinese could
look, the Communists would have an important,
readymade “ﬁfth column” throughout Southeast
Asia and in many other nations of the world.
They already have the support of some of these
Chinese, but their followmg among them has
fallen off markedly since the extortion episode
and as the nature of the regime’s excesses has be-
come increasingly apparent.
Those who favor recognition of the Peiping
regime beg the question by urging us to “recognize
reality.” We do recognize reality, and much of
it we do not like. But it is not in the American
tradition to confuse the real with the immutable.
We recognize with concern an increase in the in-
cidence of cancer in recent years, but we refuse to
recognize cancer as “the inevitable wave of the
future.”
So much for our political policy toward the
Chinese Communist regime. On the military
side it is the view of the United States that the
way to deter aggression is for the free community
to be willing and able to respond vigorously at
places and with means of its own choosing.
Policy of Total Embargo
On the economic side we follow a policy of total
embargo a ainst Communist China, and our ships
are forbid en to call at Communist Chinese ports.
It is realized that every kind of merchandise can-
not be considered to be directly helpful on the
battleﬁeld. We have felt, however, that the maxi-
mum possible economic pressures should be ap-
plied a ainst an aggressor an aged in ﬁghtin
and kil ing the troops of the nited States an
other free countries. The aggression in Korea,
so far as Communist China is concerned, will not
be considered over until its troops are all with-
drawn. The Armistice in Korea only stopped
the shooting—doubtless because the Communists
found the ﬁghting unproﬁtable—but we have seen
no indication so far that the Mao regime has
abandoned its aggressive policies. If the time
should come when the consideration of lessenin
economic controls appears appropriate, we shal
still bear in mind the effect of such action in regard
to Communist China’s plans to build a large war
potential and its avowed intent to “liberate” all of
Asia and eventually the world.
We have been committed since sivning of the
Korean Armistice Agreement last fuly and the
gassage of the United Nations General Assembly
esolution last Au st to seek a Korean Political
Conference. We ave patiently sought since
early September to arran e for such a. conference
on terms consonant with t e Armistice Agreement
and the United Nations Resolution. The Berlin
conference laid plans for a multipower conference
at Geneva on April 26 to consider a Korean settle-
ment. This will not be, as the Communists are
claiming, a ﬁve-power conference. Communist
China, far from attending the conference as a
