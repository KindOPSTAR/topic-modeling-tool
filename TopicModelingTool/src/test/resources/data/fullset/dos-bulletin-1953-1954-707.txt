Back in 1951, I negotiated treaties with the Phil-
ippines,’ Australia, and New Zealand.3 These
recognized that this area was one of vital im-
portance to the United States. These treaties
also recognized that they were only initial steps
toward the development of a more comprehensive
system of collective security in the area.
This we have constantly sought. However, it
has proved difﬁcult to achieve this result. There
were differences of race and culture and diﬁerences
in the development of national self-government.
The countries which had won or were winnin
their independence from Western colonialism an
Japanese imperialism were often more concerned
with past dangers from which the were extri-
cating themselves than with the t reat of new
peril. The memories of the past blinded them
to the present perils of Communist imperialism.
They were not disposed to make the sacriﬁces in-
herent in any collective security system.
However, this situation began to change and
by the spring of this year it seemed that there
could be a broader program of collective defense.
On March 29, 1954, after consultations with
Congressional leaders of both parties, and after
having advised our principal allies, I stated:
“The imposition on Southeast Asia of the political
system of Communist Russia and its Chinese Com-
munist ally, by whatever means, would be a grave
threat to the whole free community. The United
States feels that that possibility should not be
passively accepted but should be met by united
action.” 4
This declaration was nothing new, although the
circumstances of the moment gave the words a
new signiﬁcance.
President Eisenhower speaking almost a year
earlier, in his address of April 16, 1953, had said
that “aggression in Korea and in Southeast Asia
are threats to the whole free community to be met
by united action.” °
After having explained our purposes to the
American people, we promptly conferred with
the representatives of nine free nations having
immediate interest in the area, namely, Viet-Nam,
Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, the Philippines, Aus-
tralia and New Zealand, France, and the United
Kingdom. lVe informed others whose interests
could be aﬁected.
The Governments of the United Kingdom and
of France asked me to visit their capitals to de-
velop further our concept. After conferences at
London on April 12 and 13 with Sir Winston
Churchill and Mr. Eden, we issued a joint U.S.-
U.K. communique which, after reciting the danger
to the entire area of Southeast Asia and the West-
ern Paciﬁc caused by Communist warfare in Indo-
china, concluded: ‘ Accordingly we are ready to
take part, with the other countries principally
concerned, in an examination of the possibility of
establishing a collective defense, within the frame-
work of the Charter of the United Nations, to
assure the peace, security and freedom of South-
east Asia and the \Vestern Pacific.” '
A similar agreement was reached in Paris with
Prime Minister Laniel and Foreign Minister
Bidault.8
The progress thus made was that which the
United States had sought. We had never sought
any sudden spectacular act such as an ultimatum
to Red China. Our goal was to develop a basic
unity of constructive purpose. We advanced to-
ward that goal. I feel conﬁdent that unity of
purpose persists, and that such a tragic event as
the fall of Dien-Bien-Phu will harden, not weaken,
our purpose to stay united.
The United States and other countries immedi-
ately concerned are giving careful consideration
to the establishment of a collective defense. Con-
versations are taking place among them. We
must agree as to who will take part in the united
gefense effort, and what their commitments will
e.
It must be recognized that difﬁculties have been
encountered, but this was expected. The com-
plexity of the problem is great. As I have pointed
out, the comp ications were such that it was not
ossible even to get started until recent months.
nder all the circumstances, I believe that good
progress is being made. I feel conﬁdent that the
outcome will be such that Communist aggression
will not be able to gain in Southeast Asia the
results it seeks.
This may involve serious commitments by us
all. But free peoples will never remain free un-
less they are willing to ﬁght for their vital in-
terests. Furthermore, vital interests can no
longer be protected merely by local defense. The
key to successful defense and to the deterring of
attack is association for mutual defense. That is
what the United States seeks in Southeast Asia.
Current Hostllltiee In Wet-Nam
The question remains as to what we should do
about the current hostilities in Viet-Nam.
In Korea we showed that we were prepared
under proper conditions to resort to military ac-
tion, if necessary, to protect our vital interests
and the principles upon which stable peace must
rest.
In Korea, we, along with others, joined in the
defense of an independent government, which
