U.S. Renews Protest
In Case of Nikolai Khokhlov
Following is the text 0% a letter sent on April
29 by the Acting U.S. i h Commissioner for
Germany, Walter C. Dowfing, to the U.S.S.R.
High Commissioner Vladimir Semeno'v, concern-
ing Nikolai E. Kholchlov:
My protocol ofﬁce has received a letter dated 24
April 1954, from your protocol ofﬁce stating that
it has been instructed to return my letter of 23
April1 concerning Nikolai E. Khokhlov on the
ground that the letter contained defamatory and
grovocative attacks upon the Government of the
oviet Union.
In this connection, I should like to remind you
of a statement made by the Soviet Government
on 21 December 1953, in reply to President Eisen-
hower’s address to the United Nations on atomic
eneé'gy. In this statement the Soviet Government
sai :
The Soviet Union regards a policy which would mean
support of acts of sabotage and subversion in other coun-
tries or the ﬁnancing of secret agents or saboteurs as
incompatible with normal relations between countries.
In view of this statement by the Soviet Gov-
ernment, I am at a loss to understand your per-
emptory rejection of my letter. In the circum-
stances, I can only renew in the strongest terms
the protest conveyed to you therein.
