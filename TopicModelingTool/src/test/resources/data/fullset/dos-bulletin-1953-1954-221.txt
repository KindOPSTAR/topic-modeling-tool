Another Chance for Freedom
But now, a generation later, freedom is having
another chance in J a an and Germany. Once
more in Japan—as in ermany—there is a repre-
sentative government. There is a government
composed of men with faith in democrac who are
dedicated to the welfare of their peop e and to
securin for their country a place of dignity and
honor in the world and a voice in the common
affairs of mankind commensurate with its national
stature.
It is our polic toward Japan—as toward Ger-
many—to help t ose men succeed.
As is generally the case when one has failed a
test, the terms are, however, a little tougher the
next time around. Germany today is truncated
and has had far more damage to repair than after
World War I. Japan, which was far more
devastated by \Vorld War II than even by the
appalling earthquake of 1923, has lost its overseas
possessions and must now support a population
three-ﬁfths a ain as lar e as m 1918.
After Wor (1 War I t e Communists had their
hands full maintaining rule over a prostrate
Russia. Today, the Communist empire stretches
from the Elbe and the Danube to the waters of
Alaska and the South China Sea. This empire,
which might appropriately be represented as a
double-headed bird of prey, has ﬁxed its appetites
with particular hopefulness upon Japan and
Germany.
If, however, our obstacles are greater, we have
on our side this time much greater roductive ca-
acity and, I hope, more wisdom. We have, I be
ieve, learned a 0d deal. And by we I mean the
Ja anese and t e Germans as well as ourselves
an our friends in Western Europe.
The United States had a chance during the Oc-
Wation of Japan to show what it had learned.
e tried, if I may t to express it in one sentence,
to give the individualJapanese—man and woman,
farmer and industrial worker, artisan and profes-
sional man—as large a voice as possible and as
large a stake as poss1ble in a country as prosperous
as possible. What we wanted for the Japanese
was what we have always wanted for our own
people.
We gave strong encouragement during the Oc-
cupation to Japan’s recovery from the war, ad-
vancing about $2 billion to that end. We moved
to break up those overconcentrations, or monop-
olies, of power—economic, political, and mili-
tary—that had deprived the Japanese people of
their rights and opportunities in the years before
the war and had led Japan to disaster. It is a con-
viction of the American people that a stable and
progressive society is one in which economic and
political power is widely dispersed. This is, of
course, one of our outstanding points of difference
with the Marxists, whose practice—whatever their
theory—is to concentrate ever more power in ever
fewer hands for the beneﬁt of an ever smaller num-
ber of people.
Need for a Strong Japan
If I may further condense the statement of our
objective in the Occupation, I should sa that it
was to promote the creation of a strong Japan, in
the true and best sense of the word. Unfortu-
nately, a cardinal element of strength was left out
of our concept. We and our allies, including those
who had been occupied by the J a anese Army, did
that which had come to be norma after total war:
We totally disarmed the enemy. In addition,
Japan with our encouragement renounced mili-
tary forces in its Constitution. It was not that
we wished to leave Japan helpless in the face of
deadly danger. On the contrar . We failed to
recognize that there was such a anger or to real-
ize what kind of world we were living in and were
to live in. We put our faith in the partnership of
the United Nations, which had been forged in a
war against aggression. We did not discriminate
against Japanese safety; we impartially rushed to
disarm ourselves as well.
The Japanese are now entirely in command of
their country. Our relations with them are those
of collaboration between friends and equals. The
American troops in Japan are there for the same
reason and on the same basis as those in Western
Europe—in recognition that the problem of de-
fense against aggression today transcends nation-
ality and does not permit any of us the luxury of
llvmg unto himsel . As far as we are concerned,
nothing in our relations with J a an today reﬂects
the relationship of winner or oser, occupier or
occupied. I trust that the great majority of Jap-
anese feel this statement is true.
Toda , our hopes for Japan are the same as
those 0 the Occupation. \Ve should like to see a
strong Japan, and a Japan whose strength includes
adequate defense forces. This is, of course, our
pollcy With respect to all free eoples. I think we
ave proved that we should 1i e to see all the free
peoples grow in strength. But our hopes for
Japan have a special meaning and urgency. For
in all the ex anse of Asia, from the Urals and
the Persian ulf on the west to the Paciﬁc on the
east, Japan is alone in being an exporter of the
industrial revolution, of its science, its technology,
its skills, its machines, its manufactured goods.
The other Asian countries are, without exception,
net importers of those things.
Whenever we speak in this vein we can count on
hearing the cry, “the United States wants to use
Japan in its ﬁght with the Communists.” I think
we should hit this facile slander on two sides.
First, we should take every opportunity to make
clear that the conﬂict with communism is not
primarily an American aﬂ'air. It is not, as the
neutrals dearly love to picture it, a conﬂict between
two giant powers. The Communist danger con-
