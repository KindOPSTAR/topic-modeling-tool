forces on the other, in accordance with approved
plans with respect to their command, training,
tactical su port, and logistical organization
developed y the military agencies and the
Supreme Commanders of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.
(4) The United States will continue in con-
formity with my recommendations to the Con ress,
to seek means of extending to the Atlantic om-
munity increased securit by sharing in greater
measure information wit respect to the military
utilization of new weapons and techniques for the
im rovement of the collective defense.
5) In consonance with its policy of full and
continuing support for the maintenance of the in-
tegrity and unity of the European Defense Com-
munity, the United States will regard any action
from whatever quarter which threatens that
integrity or unity as a threat to the security of the
United States. In such event, the United States
will consult in accordance with the provisions of
Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty.
(6) In accordance with the basic interest of the
United States in the North Atlantic Treaty, as ex-
pressed at the time of ratiﬁcation, the Treaty was
regarded as of indeﬁnite duration rather than for
any deﬁnite number of years. The United States
calls attention to the fact that for it to cease to be
a party to the North Atlantic Treaty would appear
quite contrary to our security interests when there
is established on the Continent of Europe the solid
core of unity which the European Defense Com-
munity will provide.
U.K. ASSOCIATION WITH EDC
Psa'r I.—Coumon AIMS
I
In order to bring about the effective and continuous
cooperation between their respective armed forces placed
under the command of the Supreme Allied Commander,
Europe. provided for in article 2 (a) of the agreement
regarding cooperation between the United Kingdom and
the European Defence Community,‘ the authorities con-
cerned of the parties to that agreement have agreed that
it is necessary to reconcile, on a basis of reciprocity,
differing techniques in as many ﬁelds as possible, so
leading to a common military outlook. They recognise
that this reconciliation will be attained by progressive
measures of adjustment and in the light of experience,
and that the ﬁrst step will be the exchange of the neces-
sary information in the various ﬁelds. The ultimate aim
is to enable the armed forces of the United Kingdom and
the European Defence Community to operate together
in the circumstances described in article 68 (paragraph
3), 69 (paragraph 3), and 70 (paragraph 3) of the Treaty
Establishing the European Defence Community. without
reducing their eﬂectiveness.
'This draft agreement, which is included in the Com-
mand Paper, is not printed here.
II
The following are among the particular ﬁelds, appli-
cable to the three Services, in which a common military
outlook shall be sought :—
(0) Tactical Doctrine and Staff Methods
In order to ensure the best cooperation between units
of the two armed forces, tactical doctrines and staff
methods shall be reconciled as far as possible. To this
end, a continuous exchange of documentary information
shall take place between the military authorities of the
United Kingdom and of the European Defence Com-
munity. After the establishment of the European Defence
Community a Joint study group shall be set up to examine
the means of evolving common doctrines. Observers at
tactical demonstrations and exercises shall be exchanged.
(b) Logistics
The common aim is to remove such differences in logis-
tics between the armed forces of the United Kingdom
and of the European Defence Community placed under
the command of the Supreme Allied Commander. Europe,
as might prejudice active operations in the field. This
calls for the harmonisation of their logistic systems and
the standardisation of their equipment.
Harmonisation of Logistics Systems
(1) As a ﬁrst step the elimination of differences in
logistic organisation shall be sought in certain of the less
controversial ﬁelds through the agency of joint study
groups.
Standardisation of Equipment
(ii) Cooperation in this ﬁeld shall be closely related
to the work of the military agency for standardisation of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. As an immediate
step. a common system of equipment referencing shall be
sought. The military authorities of the United Kingdom
and of the European Defence Community shall exchange
all the necessary documentary information on equipment
and shall arrange the appropriate demonstrations.
(0) Training
The training methods employed by both armed forces
shall be, as far as possible. on similar lines. This will be
achieved from the early stages of the formation of the
European Defence Forces by the exchange of personnel
and of documentary information, and by the allocation
of vacancies in United Kingdom military schools and
training establishments to personnel of the European
Defence Community. and reciprocally. At a later stage,
exchanges of units may also be arranged.
These measures will in many cases represent an ex-
tension of similar facilities and arrangements at present
in force between the United Kingdom and North Atlantic
Treaty Organisation countries and will be subject to simi-
lar ﬁnancial arrangements.
The manner in which these measures can be applied in
the three Services is set out in more detail in Part II.
III
It is recognised that the extent to which the common
aims can be achieved will be conditioned by the following
factors:
(a) the obligation to conform with the doctrines and
policy of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation;
(b) the stage of evolution of the European Defence
Forces;
(c) the special characteristics of each Service: it is
probable that the closest association can be achieved in
the case of air forces:
(d) such security regulations as may be laid down by
the parties;
(e) the resources which may be available, hearing in
mind the other commitments of the United Kingdom and
of the European Defence Community.
These resources are likely to vary between each Service.
