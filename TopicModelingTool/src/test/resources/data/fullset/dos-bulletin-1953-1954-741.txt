The Challenge to Freedom
Address by Secretary Dulles 1
I am honored that you have asked me to take
part in this annual commemoration of Virginia’s
Independence Resolution and of the Virginia Bill
of Rights. Today is also Armed Forces Day.
There is a clear relationship between these two
concepts of political liberty and its defense. In-
dependence and human rights seldom persist
merely because they have been proclaimed. They
de end on the willmgness and capacity of men to
ﬁght and die, if need be, to preserve them. That
is the particular dedication of our Armed Forces,
and today as we commemorate the historic acts
of the past, we also honor those who stand ready
to defend our present heritage of freedom.
Historic acts, such as occurred here in 1776,
should continuously be remembered. That is not
merely to pay a debt which the present owes to the
past. We owe it to ourselves to keep freshly in
mind the profound wisdom and the great acts of
faith of our forefathers. As was declared in the
Virginia Bill of Rights, “no free government, or
the blessings of liberty, can be preserved to any
people, but by frequent recurrence to
fundamental principles.”
A great part was played here in Williamsburg
during the ﬁrst 6 months of 1776. The Independ-
ence Resolution adopted here by the Virginia Con-
vention of Delegates on May 15, 1776, was the im-
mediate prelude to the Fourth of July Declara-
tion of Independence. The Virginia Bill of Rights
adopted on June 12, 1776, led directly to our Con-
stitutional Bill of Rights.
The course set by Virginia proved in harmony
with the spirit which pervaded all the Colonies,
and it led to the creation on this continent of a
political union inspired by the principles of re-
ligion and dedicated to liberty and justice.

“The Great American Experiment"
That, in turn, soon had worldwide consequences.
Our Republic produced such rich fruits—spirit-
ual, intellectual, and material—that it became
widely known as “The Great American Ex-
periment.”
This happened when the tide of despotism was
high. Czar Alexander and his allies were seekin
to extend their colonial domain and their politics.
system throughout the world.
At that juncture, the example of our Nation
caught the imagination of men everywhere and
largely inspired them, in their turn, to seek liberty.
So stron was that urge that in the end the despots
had to re ax their grip.
There followed a century which brought to many
increased political freedom and a large improve-
ment in economic and social welfare.
Today our Nation faces conditions which are in
certain respects similar to those which we faced
during the early years of our Republic. A tide of
despotism again threatens to engulf the world.
This has come about largely as a penalt for
man’s inability to prevent war. The First orld
War and the defeat of Russia enabled a small
group of fanatical Communists to gain control of
that great nation. The Second World War en-
abled that group to extend their power to the East
and to the West so that it now dominates 800
million people or one-third of the peoples of the
world. Their rulers are seeking still further to
“extend their rule. That is conspicuously the case
today in relation to the 200 million people of
Southeast Asia. Their avowed aim is to bring
all of mankind under the rule of their system.
The United States today is a great and powerful
Nation, able to exercise a far greater material in-
ﬂuence than could the young Rwublic. But we are
now a matured Nation, and we are rich in mate-
rial things. That makes it harder to exert moral
inﬂuence such as we developed during the early
