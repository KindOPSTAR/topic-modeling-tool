and consistent opposition in the negotiations both
at Panmunjom and later at Berlin to their unac-
ceptable conference proposals. They ﬁnally be-
came convinced that our side would never agree
to the kind of conference they had proposed.
I am inclined to think that the Soviet Union
in consultation with its Chinese Communist part-
ners has concluded that notwithstanding the ex-
press stipulations of the resolution setting up the
conference, Geneva may represent the beginnin
of an opportunity to advance the internationa
prestige and gradually force the eneral inter-
national acceptance of Communist hina. They
hope to exaggerate the role assigned to Communist
China b the resolution. Having failed to obtain
a so-ca ed “ﬁve-power conference” to include
Communist China, they hope nevertheless to
portray the conference to be held at Geneva in the
alse guise of a ﬁve-power conference. Already
the process has started. The ropaganda out of
Moscow and Peiping refers incessantly to “the
forthcomin ﬁve-power conference” at Geneva.
Many non- ommunist correspondents in Europe,
Asia, and a few in our own country are unwit-
tingly furthering the Communist line by carelessly
referring to the conference as a ﬁve-power one.
Multl-Power, not Five Power, Conference
It is essential that we kee the record straight.
It is not a “ﬁve-power con erence” but a multi-
power conference. It was made crystal clear to
the Soviet Union through the Berlin conference
that we em hatically rejected the concept of great-
power con erences which would play a principal
role in settling the large issues of the world w1th
all other countries relegated to a secondary role.
Communist China has no position above that of
any other participant. The Chinese Communist
regime wil be present only because of its aggres-
sor role, and it will be called upon to give an
accounting for its aggression.
As the ﬁnal paragraph of the resolution makes
clear, there is no diplomatic recognition of Com-
munist China implied in the holding of this con-
ference. Communist China will be present as a
regime which we are dealing with on a local basis
and only in regard to strictly limited subjects
where the regime is necessarily a party at interest
through its aggressive interventions. Far from
dealing with it as a great power, we do not even
deal with it as a le 'timate government. We
should not erroneous?l assume that Communist
China has been accor ed any special status. \Ve
were successful in keeping the Chinese Commu-
nist regime in its pro r place in the negotia-
tions at Berlin. It wou d be unfortunate if Com-
munist China should now be allowed to claim a
prestige to which it is not entitled and which was
explicitly denied to it at Berlin.
Undoubtedly the Soviet Union hopes through
the Korean Political Conference at Geneva to
drive an opening wedge in the door to the family
of nations which is now closed to Communist
China. We assume that the U.S.S.R. hopes in
due course to force that door wide open and obtain
a seat for Communist China at all the council
tables of the famil of nations. The Soviets are
staking much on tliieir ability to use the Geneva
Conference to further this aim.
But we are conﬁdent that without giving any
preferment or any improved international status
to the Peiping regime we can ascertain if there
is any disposition on the part of Communist China
to agree to Korean and Indochinese settlements.
If the Chinese Communists are not willing to see
a peaceful uniﬁcation of a free and independent
Korea, and a restoration of peace in the States of
Indochina, we believe that fact will be clearly ex-
posed for all to see at Geneva, as the Soviet de-
signs for Germany and Austria were exposed at
Berlin.
\Ve have nothin to fear from partici ation in
the conference at eneva. As Secretary ulles so
clearly put it in his report to the Nation last
week:'3
There is . . . no reason why we should refuse to seek
peacefully the results we want merely because of fear that
we will be outmaneuvered at the conference table. No
informed observers believe that we were outmaneuvered
at Berlin. . . . Our cause is not so poor, and our capacity'
not so low, that our Nation must seek security by sulking
in its tent.
If we are able to achieve satisfactory settlements
at Geneva, it will be a boon to the peoples of Korea
and Indochina and contribute to the peace and
stability of the Far East. If we are not, it will
demonstrate to the world that the Communists are
not willing to abandon their aggressive policies in
Asia, but are intent on bringing it under their
total control. Such an exposure would in itself
be signiﬁcant. It would tend to stren hen the
unity of the free nations in the face of t eir com-
mon danger.
If I were asked to put in a nutshell the result of
Berlin, I should say that it reaﬂirmed and
strengthened unity among the United States, the
United Kingdom, and France and brought about
a clearer perception by all the peoples of Euro e
of the sinister nature of the Communist grand e-
sign for Europe.
As to the Far East, the stage in effect was
merely transferred from Panmunjom and Berlin
to Geneva. The conference there will be a testing
time for each side. At Geneva we will have an
opportunity to probe deeply into Communist in-
tentions as to Korea and Indochina with the pros-
pect of ﬁndings which may be as revelatory as
those brought to light at the meeting of the For-
eign Ministers in Berlin.
We sincerely hope that the results of the con-
ference at Geneva will bring to the peoples of the
