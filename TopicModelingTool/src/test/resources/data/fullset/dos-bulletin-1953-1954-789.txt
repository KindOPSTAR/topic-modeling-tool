Nations rightly refused to accept such offers with
strings attached that the Soviet bloc dropped the
conditions on the use of these funds.
On November 4, 1953, the U.S.S.R. commu-
nicated to the International Labor Organization
in Geneva its decision to join that Organization.
Again there was a reservation—this time that they
would not acce t the jurisdiction of the Interna-
tional Court 0 Justice. Because of that impor-
tant reservation, the ILO found that it could not
accept Russian adherence. The U.S.S.R. then re-
vised its osition on the Inc and on April 26, 1954,
joined t at Organization without reservations.
Almost at the same time, the USSR. notiﬁed
Unssco that it would accept the Unssco Consti-
tution without reservations and should, therefore,
be considered a member of the Organization.
These apparent reversals of Soviet policy are
all the more signiﬁcant since both UNESCO and the
ILO have been prime targets of Soviet attacks over
the years. They never missed an op ortunity of
describing the International Labor rganization
as “an instrument of ca italist emplo ers to en-
slave the workers of t e world.” s regards
UNESCO, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary,
which had belonged to that Organization, even
though they did not actively articipate in its
work in recent years, resigned rom membership
only a short while ago on the grounds that it was
an instrument of “American imperialism.”
What accounts for the present change in the
Kremlin’s attitude? We are familiar with the
pattern of sweetness and light which is turned off
and on like a water tap by the Russians whenever
it suits them. WVhether the change in the Soviet
a proach toward the economic activities of the
nited Nations is merely part and parcel of their
so-called “peace oﬂ’ensive, ’ which in effect means
no real change in Soviet policy, will be determined
in the days ahead.
A Tostlmonlal to U. N. Achlevements
This change of tune by the Soviet and its satel-
lites after years of refusin to participate in the
economic activities of the nited Nations is in a
sense a testimonial to the real accomplishments of
the United Nations in this ﬁeld. The Communist
attempt to boycott the specialized agencies has
backﬁred. Soviet leaders undoubtedly are wor-
ried about the growing effectiveness of aid offered
to underdeveloped countries. The eople of un-
derdeveloped areas have become disi us10ned with
Communist propagandists and agitators who at-
tack United Nations and American assistance as
“colonial exploitation” but who never produce any
constructive contributions of their own. The ac-
complishments of the 1L0 in encouraging the rais-
ing of labor standards, of UNESCO in bringing
basic educational facilities to underdeveloped
areas and in fostering intellectual freedom, have
posed a real challenge to the Communist system.
The Soviets have also been worried by the lead-
ership the United States Government has given
to these pro rams. Soviet lack of cooperation was
not overloo ed in the underdeveloped countries.
The Russians could not reconcile this lack of coop-
eration with professed concern for the welfare of
the underdeveloped countries. Moreover, the
Soviets were plainly upset by the United Nations
efforts, in close cooperation with the International
Labor Orvanization, to focus public opinion on
the denial of basic rights to workers in the
USSR. and the inhuman Soviet slave labor
camps.
It remains to be seen whether the Communist
system can adapt itself to the free world atmos-
here in which these United Nations activities
unction, or whether the Communist objective will
be disruption through inﬁltration. We have here
another good testing ground of Soviet intentions.
Will they abide by the rules of the game? \Vill
they, like other contributors, be content to leave
to the proper boards and committees the im le-
mentation of the adopted policies of the specialized
avencies? Will they be willing to act as members
0 ILO and UNESCO on the same footing as other
members?
_We genuinely hope so. If the Soviets, for what-
ever motives, are prepared even temporarily to
take seriously the commitments of the charter and
behave in these organizations as real supporters,
their participation will be welcome.
But if they are joining these organizations in
order to sabotage them, if Soviet membership
results in the usual kind of Communist obstruc-
tionism and propa anda, this can on] brin forth
a strong reaction 0m the free wor d. l e will
watch carefully Soviet action and do everything
possible to revent an interference with the con-
structive e orts of t e United Nations. This
means ﬁrst of all that we will be ﬁrm in resisting
any attempt on the part of the USSR to chan
the rules under which the United Nations and t e
specialized agencies are operating.
Any attempt on the part of the U.S.S.R. to
change the tripartite character of Ino in which
workers, independent employers, and governments
work in close cooperation could not possibl be
accepted. We are not interested in nor wil the
Sowets be permitted to get away with chea ges-
tures. I can assure you that the United tates
Government, in cooperation with other free gov-
ernments, W111 insist that the rules already estab-
lished in the Economic and Social Council and
the specialized agencies be observed.
In UNESCO, we need not fear any conﬂict of ideas
between the free world and the Communist world,
for truth is stronger than falsehood. We need not
be apprehensive about the continuing effectiveness
of the International Labor Organization in pro-
moting industrial peace and improved labor con-
ditions, for both the employers and the workers
represented in the 11.0 are, with governments of
