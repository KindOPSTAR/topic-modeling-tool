The Development of United States Policy in the Near East,
South Asia, and Africa During 1953: Part III
by Harry N. Howard
MUTUAL SECURITY
AND ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS
The Problem of Mutual Security In the
Near and Middle East
That the United States continued its funda-
mental interest in the security of the Near and
Middle East during 1953 was clear from the early
addresses of Secretary Dulles on foreign policy.
Although the signing of the Tripartite Pact
among Greece, Turkey, and Yugoslavia, on Feb-
ruary 28, 1953, re resented a contribution to the
security of the Ba kan region and of the Eastern
Mediterranean, as did the October 12 agreement
between the United States and Greece concerning
base facilities, there was no progress with respect
to the development of a Middle East Defense Or-
ganization, the outlines and principles of which
were elaborated in October-November 1951.
In his report of June 1, 1953, concerning the
Near East, Secretary Dulles expressed the view
that the establishment of a Middle East Defense
Organization was “a future rather than an imme-
diate possibility,” since “many of the Arab League
countries are so engrossed with their quarrels with
Israel or with Great Britain or France that they
pay little heed to the menace of Soviet commu-
nism.” Where the Soviet Union was near, there
was more concern, however, and, in general, “the
northern tier of nations" demonstrated “awareness
of the danger.” There was “a vague desire to have
a collective security system,” but it could not be
from without, and “should be designed
an grow from within out of a sense of common
destiny and common danger.” Secretary Dulles
believed that, while awaiting the formal creation
of a “securit association,” the United States could
“usefully be p strengthen the interrelated defense
of those countries which want strength, not as
against each other or the \Vest, but to resist the
common threat to all free peoples.” ‘5
The Mutual Security Program for Fiscal Year
1954 showed a basic awareness of the problems
in the Near East, South Asia, and Africa,“ noting
that in the Near East, “ litical instability, eco-
nomic weakness and an a most total lack of mili-
tary strength” presented “an open invitation to
subversive forces from within and hostile litical
and military pressures from without.” 1 oreover,
“the restige of the western Democracies, includ-
ing t e United States in the Moslem States” had
“progressively deteriorated in the (postwar era"
and required “the most urgent an decisive re-
medial measures.” The ob]ectives of the United
States in the Near East and Africa were described
as follows:
