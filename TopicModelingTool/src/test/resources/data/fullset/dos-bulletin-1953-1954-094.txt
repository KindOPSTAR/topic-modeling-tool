The Special Refugee Survey Commission to the

ments, from Minnesota, and Dr. James L. Fieser,
former Vice Chairman and General Manager of
the American Red Cross, of Bethesda, Maryland,
each representative of a different section of the
United States.
The Commission was set up in October, 1953,
under provision of the Mutual Security Act of
1953, as follows:
Section 706, Title V. Relating to organization and gen-
eral provision of the Mutual Security Act of 1951, as
amended, as follows: ° ' ' (1:) Near East Refugees—
add after Sec. 548, the following new section:
Section 549. (a) In order to contribute to the peace and
stability of the Near East in particular and of the
world in general. the Director for Mutual Security
shall, in consultation with the Secretary of State, make
a survey of the refugee situation in the Near East and
report the results of the survey to the Congress within
one hundred ﬁfty days after the Mutual Security Act
of 1953 is enacted, together with recommendations for
seeking a solution. In the making of such report and
recommendations. special consideration shall be given
to a program which Willlld utilize the services and tal-
ents of these refugees to develop and expand the re-
sources of the area. including its water resources.
It was originally planned that the Commission
would depart for the Near East on November 7,
and that about three weeks would be spent in the
area studying the situation. On their return the
Commission would complete its re rt for trans-
mission to the Congress by Decem er 14, 1953, as
provided by Section 549 of the Mutual Security
Act of 1951, as amended, as quoted above.
“Transmitted on Dec. 14 to the President. the Vice
President. the Speaker of the House of Representatives,
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the House
Foreign Affairs Committee.
Circumstances, however, necessitated a defer-
ment of the ﬁeld survey to a more feasible date.
It was therefore determmed that an interim report
be ﬁled pending a later visit to the Near East to
study the situation at ﬁrst hand, when a ﬁnal re-
port would be made.
Inasmuch as it was not ossible for the Com-
mission to survey the conditions in the area ﬁrst
hand, it decided to commence its examination of
the problem along the following lines:
1. Consultation with oﬁcial representatives of
the Arab and Israeli Governments in the United
States.
2. Consultation with delegates to the United
Nations, oﬁicials of the United Nations, and at-
tendance at sessions of the United Nations on the
Palestine uestion.
3. Consu tation with Members of Congress who
have recent] been in the Near East.
4. Meet wrth members of the United States dele-
gation to the General Assembly of the United
Nations.
5. Interview oﬂicials of voluntary and non-gov-
ernmental agencies which conduct relief pro-
grams in the Near East area.
6. Conferences with re resentatives of the
United Nations Relief and orks Agenc for Pal-
estine Refugees (UNRWA), the Chief o the Staﬂ
of the United Nations Truce Su rvisory Organi-
zation, and with the former United Nations Act-
in Mediator for Palestine, Dr. Ralph Bunche.
g. Consultations on water resources with Mr.
Eric Johnston, Special Representative of the
President, and with Mr. Gordon Clapp, Chairman
of the Board of Tennessee Valley Authority.
8. Study of reports, and other documentation
on the subject.
All of the above were done, and in all contacts the
Commission was received cordially.
Because the Commission is not in a position to
make any ﬁrm ﬁndings until an inspection of con-
ditions in the area is possible, this is necessarily
an interim report.

The Arab refugees from Palestine are the vic-
tims of political, economic, social, and religious
