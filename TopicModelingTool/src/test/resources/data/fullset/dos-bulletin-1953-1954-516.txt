Conslderatlons Underlylng U.S.-China Policy
bDy E dwin W. Martin
eputy Director, Oﬁce of Chinese Aﬁairs ‘
It is a real privilege for me to be able to meet
with you of t e China Committee today and to
take a small part in your annual meeting. It has
been a pleasure to renew acquaintances with many
of you and to meet others for the ﬁrst time. This
association is particularly stimulating to me, for
it is seldom that those of us in the Department of
State who are primarily concerned with Chinese
affairs have an op ortunity to foregather with such
a large group 0 people who also have a major
interest in China. I can assure you I have learned
much here today.
I hope that I also have something to contribute,
although I must confess that I face you with some
trepidation, knowin that many, if not most of
on, have lived in C ina several times as long as
and have been closely following events in China
for many more years. On the other hand be-
cause you are a specialized audience, I do not ave
to explain how com lex and difﬁcult a subject
China is, nor apologize because I cannot present
to you a simple formula for solving what is some-
times called ‘the China problem.”
The only distinction which I might perhaps
claim in this athering of older and Wiser China
hands is the ubious one of having had the most
recent direct contact with officials of the present
mainland regime. As a member of Ambassador
Dean’s Miss10n, I sat across a narrow table from
Chinese and North Korean Communist ofﬁcials
day after day for a period of 7 weeks and, later
on, after Mr. Dean returned to this country, dur-
ing another series of lower-level meetings.
I would not recommend such an experience for
leasure, and I am not sure how much insight
into what makes the Communists tick we gained
from these formal, cold, and often acrimonious,
discussions. However, I did come away with a
stron impression that the men who run Commu-
nist hina dwell in another world from us, live
by an entirely different set of standards, and ap-
pear to have no genuine interest in working out

mutually acceptable solutions to the s eciﬁc prob-

are causing the current tensions in the Far East.
The Geneva Conference
The forthcoming conference at Geneva, how-
ever, will give us an opportunity once again to test
Chinese Communist intentions. Our agreement to
this conference has led to considerable discussion
in the press and in other public forums as to its
signiﬁcance in terms of our China. policy. The
question is asked: Does our a eement to sit down
at Geneva with representatives of the Peipin
regime mean that our olicy on China has change
or is about to change
The answer is deﬁnite] no. The Soviet
attempt at Berlin to bring a ut a. so-called ﬁve-
power conference was categorically rejected b the
three lVestern Foreign Ministers. Instea , an
agreement was ﬁnally accepted by the Soviets to
hold a conference on Korea alon the lines pro-
posed in the U.N. General Assemb y resolution of
August 28, 1953,’ which was based on the Armi-
stice Agreement and supported by the United
States. The Peiping regime will participate in
this conference solely as one of the belligerents
in Korea. Its status will be no diﬂerent from that
of its fellow aggressor, the North Korean regime.
It must be dealt with because of its involvement
in Korean affairs.
The same situation a plies to that hase of the
conference dealing with Indochina. n addition
to the four nations represented at Berlin, other
interested parties will participate, including Com-
munist China, whose interest stems from its moral
and material support of Ho Chi Minh’s rebel
forces. The basis of the conference will be the
same as that in the Korean phase. We will be
dealing with it on a strictly limited subject where
the Peiping regime is necessarily a. party at in-
terest through its aggressive intervention.
In order to make it ex licit that in participat-
ing in the conference at eneva with representa-
