We live in a small world, and only by a cooper-
ative effort of the free peoples occupying im or-
tant areas can we build security and peace. t is
not a question of turning the press, radio, tele-
vision, and newsreels into media of sugar-coated
propaganda, “selling” America to the Frenchman,
rance to the German, and Britain to the
American.
It is quite different from that. I repeat: For
understanding we need the facts and the perspec-
tive within which they ﬁt. I am sure that the
free press in all free countries has made real prog-
ress in this direction. But I think a lot more can
and by all means should, be done. The future of
all of us depends upon it.
No group can be more effective in such accom-
plishment than you of the American Newspaper
ublishers Association. Here, indeed, is an en-
deavor worthy of your talents and skills.
Within the framework of friendly alliances, we
are joined with hundreds of millions among the
free nations in working agreements, primarily
concerned with military security but inescapany
dealing with every hope and every concern of daily
life. Together we live in a mighty arena, bounded
b the polar regions, practically encircling the
g obe, peopled by men and women of independent
nations. These peoples, with scanty information
and understanding of one another, are now allies
of convenience under Communist threat; but to-
morrow they could be full artners ermanently
joined in mutual understan ing, impe led by com-
mon aspirations. Among the nations of that vast
arena, at least, war can become unthinkable—
quickly. A cooperative peace among them is no
mirage of the dreamer.
Within the United Nations, we possess a global
forum where we can plead the cause of ' eace
so that even the men of the Kremlin must listen.
Their ears may be stopped to the spirit of our
words. Their minds, however, cannot forever be
shut to the facts of the age within which we—and
they—must live, physically separated one from
the other by a few hours of ﬂight.
We cannot hope with a few speeches, a few
conferences, a few agreements to achieve the most
difficult of all human goals—a cooperative peace
for all mankind. Here may I say, my friends
that your representatives in the diplomatic world
have no other thought or no other urpose than
that which I have just stated: the ac ievement of
a cooperative peace among the free nations and
eventually to enlarge that by appealin to the
common sense, representing the facts of t e world
as they are today to all others, so that even the
iron wall must crumble and all men can join
together.
Trlbute to Secretary Dulles
To lead that kind of effort, we are blessed—
and I say we are blessed, and I believe it from the
bottom of my heart—with a man whose whole
life has been devoted to this one purpose, who
from bab hood has studied and thought and con-
templated, how to achieve this one great oal of
humankind, well knowing that within 1118 life-
time erfection cannot be attained, but to do his
part in reachin it. I cannot tell you how sin-
cerely I believe t at every one of us—every one of
160 million people—owes a great debt of gratitude
to Foster Dulles.
Free men do not lose their patience, their
courage, their faith, because the obstacles are
mountainous, the path uncharted. Given under-
standing, they iiivariably rise to the challenge.
Never, then, has there been a more compe ling
and rewarding time to work for internation.
understandin , to labor for cooperative peace.
I most ﬁrm y believe that the American people’s
decision to strengthen our country—in moral lead-
ership, in intellectual stature, in military posture,
in a dependable rosperity widely shared—will
be realized. Un erlying that decision is a tre-
mendous spiritual energy which I believe to be
adequate to every test. I believe that it grows
from day to day as our eople become more and
more aware of the dead y nature of the world’s
struggle.
I most ﬁrmly believe, too, that world leader-
ship in the cause of cooperative peace lies Within
the capacity of America. This capacity will be
realized when everyone here present uses his mind
and his will and all his resources in union with
others of like inﬂuence, to bring about the under-
standing, the comprehension, the determination
we need. Freedom of expression is not merely a.
right—in the circumstances of today, its construc-
tive use is a stern duty. Have we, have you as
publishers, the courage fully to exercise the
right and perform the duty?
Along with patriotism—understanding, com-
prehension, determination are the qualities we,
now need. Without them, we cannot win. With
them, we cannot fail.
A Time of Great Decisions
Remarks by the President‘
White House press release dated Aprll 26
I think each of us senses that when we meet, as
you are meeting today, we are doing so in a time
of great decisions. I think it is no longer neces-
sary to enter into a long argument or exposition
to show the importance to the United States of
Indochina and of the struggle oing on there.
No matter how the struggle ma ave started, it
has long since become one of t e testi places
between a free form of government and ictator-
