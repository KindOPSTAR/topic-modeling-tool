1942, and December 3, 1942, which proclaimed the
United States-Uruguayan Trade Agreement.
This followed termination by mutual consent
of the reci rocal trade agreement concluded be-
tween the nited States and Uruguay in 1942.
The action was taken in view of the fact that
Uruguay on December 16, 1953, became a contract-
ing arty to the General Agreement on Tariffs
and rade to which the United States is also a
party. Pursuant to United States policy of su-
perseding existing bilateral agreements as coun-
tries parties thereto become contracting parties to
the General Agreement, steps for terminating the
bilateral agreement were taken while Uru ay was
negotiating for accession to the Genera Agree-
ment.
The termination of the 1942 proclamations,
which is effective as of December 28, 1953, results
in no changes in tariﬁ' rates.
