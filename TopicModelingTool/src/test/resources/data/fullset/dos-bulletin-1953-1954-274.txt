have altered the traditional patterns of domestic
life and have increased the country’s strength and
restige in the sphere of international affairs.
The ﬁrst was a basic shift from a single-party po-
litical system to a more ﬂexible and representative
multiparty system. This shift was accomplished
by peaceful means of free and honest elections and
has had the desired effect of greatly increasing the
interest of the average Turkish citizen in his own
political, economic, and social well-being.
The second major change has occurred in the
military strength of Turkey. The defense forces
of Turkey have been substantially modernized and
by unanimous agreement of all parties concerned
have been integrated with the forces of other free
nations in the North Atlantic Treaty Or aniza-
tion. The effectiveness of the nation’s ﬁghting
men has been tested in Korea where they per-
formed with great distinction in the collective ac-
tion of the free world to halt Communist aggres-
sion. The third but not the least important
change has been takin place in the structure, di-
rection, and velocity of the Turkish economy.
The nature and signiﬁcance of these economic
changes are unique and merit careful attention by
free-world observers. At the time of the estab-
lishment of the Turkish Republic the amount of
domestic private capital available for investment
was insigniﬁcant in terms of the country’s needs
and the then Turkish Government entertained a
dee -seated distrust of forei capital both public
an private. Under these circumstances the gov-
ernment adopted a licv of statism, and it is im-
portant to note that it did so out of what it believed
to be economic necessity and not because the lead-
ers were imbued with any of the various brands
of doctrinaire socialism in vogue at that time in
Europe and Asia. The government instituted a
nationalization program which effected the trans-
fer of ownership and control of most industrial
and service enterprises from foreign interests to
the national govermnent.
This move was followed by the establishment of
a number of state-owned banks which were given
speciﬁc tasks of or nizing and operating mining
ventures and in ustrial establishments. The
range of the latter ran all the wa from textile
and glass plants to cement factories and ﬁnally
to a steel indust . Although during the ﬁrst 25
years of the Repﬁlic’s life some private enterprise
coexisted with government owned and operated
industries, the government was the dominant force
in the economy. It had primary responsibility
for determining how much of the national income ‘
should be saved and for directing these savings
into 5 iﬁc investments. F ortunately this great
centra ized economic power of the state was devoid
of the diabolical political trappings inherent in
orthodox Fascist and Communist systems then in
force in neighboring countries, and consequently
the Turkish State did not exercise total politico-
economic controls comparable to those used by the
/
tory tax treatment.2 Another an
Italian State under Mussolini or the Russian State
under Stalin. _
This capacity of the Turks for facing economic
reality and for resisting the temptations of any
of the extreme economic, iolitical, and social doc-
trines of totalitarian re ormers has layed no
small part in the recent and rapid swing of the
economy away from statism an toward private
and competitive enterprise. After a quarter of a
century of statism the Turks are reexamining their
economic policies and programs with the View to
reshaping the count ’s economic and ﬁnancial
institutions and ractices to meet today’s circum-
stances, which diﬁ'er drastically from those that
prevailed at the time the policy of statism was
adopted. The Turks have found statism to be
far too inflexible to satisfy the country’s expand-
ing and changing economic needs, and they are not
perniittin any abstract economic doctrine to hin-
der them rom making the necessary and desirable
changes.
The ﬁrst positive legislative action taken to
speed up the shift from 'Fublic to rivate enter-
rise occurred in 1951. his helpe to deﬁne the
elds in which rivate business could partici ate
without fear olf) government competition. he
government announced its intent gradual] to liq-
uidate its holdings in those industrial ields to
be developed by private ca ital. Up to the pres-
ent time this action has en more effective in
encouraging new industries to enter ﬁelds pre-
viously occupied by or earmarked for development
by government than in effecting actual transfers
of ownership and control of existing industrial
plants from government to private hands. This
is quite understandable since many of the existing
government-owned plants are burdened with ob-
solete equipment and are uneconomically located
from either a production or a marketing stand-
point.
Legislation enacted in early 1954 several
steps beyond the 1951 measures especially on the
vitally important matter of offering positive in-
ducements to prospective private investors both
domestic and foreign. It contains reasonably
liberal provisions for private foreign investors
especially on such matters as withdrawal from the
country of proﬁts and capital—both original and
reinvested earnings, and equitable nondiscrimina-
d closely related
' Under the new law, enacted on Jan. 18, repatriation of
capital is no longer subject to a minimum time limit.
Formerly. cash outlay capital could not be repatriated
until after 3 years from the date of entry, while capital
in the form of equipment and nonphysical assets had to
remain in Turkey for 5 years before repatriation was
permitted.
There now are no restrictions on the transfer of profits,
interests, and dividends as compared with the former
annual limitation of 10 percent of the capital base. The
principal of. and interest on. foreign loans are also freely
transferable and are no longer subject to the restrictions
previously imposed.
