(1) to contribute to the reduction of C00 sur-
plus stocks which are becoming costly to hold and
the existence of which exerts a depressing inﬂu-
ence upon the market;
(2) to dispose of such stocks abroad in the most
constructive manner in order to strengthen the
economies of friendly foreign countries, to en-
courage an increase in consumption articularly
where consumption standards are ibw, to en-
courage trade, to build up defenses, etc.; and
(3) to avoid substitution for or displacement
of sales which would otherwise take place.
To the extent that the surplus commodities can
be employed to defray expenditures abroad of the
U.S. Government, without jeo ardy to other objec-
tives, every effort will be ma e to do so.
Agreements: It will be necessary as a general
rule to negotiate with friendly foreign countries
agreements concerning the kinds and amounts of
commodities which they might undertake to ab-
sorb during the period of the program—without
substitution for or displacement of sales which
would take place in the normal course of trade—
and the uses to which the local currency-sales pro-
ceeds would be put. The uses of such sales pro-
ceeds will no doubt vary from country to country.
The proportions which can be used in payment for
U.S. Government expenses will also vary de-
nding upon our negotiating position and the
alancing of all our objectives. A recipient coun-
try will usually be reluctant to accept, in effect, sur-
plus a 1'ricultural commodities on any considerable
scale in substitution for pros ective dollar earn-
ings. \Ve have experienced t is problem in con-
nection with negotiations for accelerated use of
local currency from surplus property credits.
The International Tln Agreement of 1953
by Clarence W. Nichols
The text of the International Tin Agreement
of 1953 was established by the United Nations
Conference on Tin. This agreement is now under
review and subject to si ature by 23 governments
which were represented y delegates in the Second
Session of the Conference.1 Continuing the nego-

‘ Australia. Belgian Congo and Ruanda Urundi, Belgium,
' Bolivia, ,Brazil, British Colonial and Dependent TOI‘i'ltt)
ries, Canada, Denmark, Ecuador, France, Federal Repub-
lic of Germany, India, lndnncsln, Italy. Japan, Lebanon,
Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey,
United Kingdom, United States. The following govern-
ments were represented by observers: Hungary. Iran,
Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics, Yugoslavia.
Moreover, it is diﬂicult to determine whether dol-
lars spent by the U.S. Government in such cases
would not in fact have been used subsequent]
to urchase similar commodities in the Hi
mar et. If so, the net result is no increase in
the export of U.S. commodities.
Under the best of circumstances negotiations
require time which will not necessarily coincide
with the requirement for ex enditures for a
speciﬁc project or purpose. he Defense De-
partment, for example, could not hold u a con-
tract pending the conclusion of a broa agree-
ment relating to the use of surplus commodities.
Purchases o Surplus Commodities Under Mu-
tual Security rogram: As you know, the foreign-
aid rograms have moved a considerable volume
of .S. a icultural commodities. Under sec-
tion 550 0 the Mutual Security Act” eﬂ'orts are
being undertaken to use surplus commodities
speciﬁcally in military aid programs abroad, in-
c uding off-shore procurement transactions.
Conclusion: With a disposal program of this
magnitude it will be necessary to explore all possi-
bilities for the use of surplus commodities without
causing adverse effects upon our trade and trade
of friendly countries, a princi le which Congress
stated in section 550 of the utual Security Act
and which the President reiterated in his recent
budget message. Consistent with overall objec-
tives our negotiations will attempt to use to the
optimum extent surplus commodities in lace of
dollar expenditures abroad by the U.S. ‘overn-
ment.

tiations which had been undertaken in 1950, the
Second Session was held at Geneva November 1&-
December 9, 1953. The pa se of the Conference
was to discuss measures I'dltsigned to meet the
special diiliculties which exist or are expected to
arise concerning tin and to conclude an inter-
national commodity agreement, should such an
agreement be considered desirable.
The proposals for stabilization which were sub-
mitted durin the 1950 session diﬂ'ered so widely
that the Con erence concluded there was need for
further and separate consideration by govern-
ments. The sesion of October-November 1950
therefore adjourned in Geneva subject to recon-
