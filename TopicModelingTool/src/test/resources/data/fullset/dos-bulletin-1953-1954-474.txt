AN APPROACH TO A PEACEFUL WORLD ON A PERSON-TO-PERSON BASIS
Following is the text of the 12th semiannual
report of the International Educational Exchange
Program of the Department of State, which was
transmitted to the Congress on March 22.‘
LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL
To: The Honorable the President of the Senate
The Honorable the Speaker of the House of
Representatives
Sins:
Pursuant to Section 1008 of Public Law 402
(80th Con ess), I transmit herewith the 12th
semiannua report of the International Educa-
tional Exchange Program of the Department of
State. This re ort reviews exchange activities
carried out an er authority of this act during
the period July 1-December 31, 1953.
Previously, reports on educational exchange ac-
tivities were included in the semiannual reports
of the former International Information Admin-
istration. However, under President Eisenhow-
er’s Reorganization Plan No. 8,2 effective August
1, 1953, international educational exchange activ-
ities and information activities were separated.
The educational exchange program was retained
in the Department of State and an independent
agency created to administer information activi-
ties under the act.
This report on educational exchange activities
administered under the act is therefore submitted
separately by the Department of State.
Very truly yours,
Jomv Fos'raa Dunnns
Secretary of State

The International Educational Exchange Pro-
gram was born of a faith and a conviction.
It was faith in the democratic system, in the
American way of life. It was conviction that the
sharing of ideas through direct personal experi-
ence would strengthen genuine understanding and
mutual respect basic to the security of the free
world.
Today that security is threatened. The Com-
munists are trying to convince the peoples of the
world that international communism, not de-
mocracy, is the answer to their problems. Other
anti-American forces are sowing mistrust of our
motives.
The Educational Exchange Pro in has
proved that it is a sound antidote. It is building
up a receptive climate of public opinion overseas.
In this atmosphere our actions, our motives, and
our policies can be correctly understood.
As now constituted, the rogram has its 1 -
islative roots in the Smith- undt Act, the Felﬁ-
bright Act, and a number of other pieces of special
legislation.
An integral part of the De artment of State,
the program receives speci policy guidance
whic makes it immediately responsive to sensi-
tive world conditions. Through the conduct of
this program the Department is able to carry out
its leadership role, as desired by the Con ess, in
coordinating the exchange efforts of 0t er U.S.
Government and private agencies to further for-
eign policy objectives.
