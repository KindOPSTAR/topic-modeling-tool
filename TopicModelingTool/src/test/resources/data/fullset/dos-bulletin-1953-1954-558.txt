United Silt“ Ald to Berlln 1945-54
In addition to Federal Republic aid to Ger-
many, it has taken about $750 million of U.S. aid
since 1945 to bring Berlin to its present state of
recovery. In the ﬁscal year 1952—53 the Mu-
tual Security Agenc aided Berlin to the extent
of $22 million. This was supplemented by $50
million made available b President Eisenhower
in June 1953 for the Ber in stockpile and invest-
ment rograms,’ and $15 million made available
for re ugee housing in Berlin in 1954. The larger
portion, $10 million, was spent in the Federal Re-
public to aid in the absorption of refugees coming
through Berlin; the remaining $5 million was for
housing actually in Berlin.
It is generally recognized that the needs of Ber-
lin, although they have changed considerably over
the last few years, are continuing and urgent. In
this connection, the continuation of U.S. occupa-
tion responsibilities in Berlin is important. F ur-
thermore, Harold E. Stassen, Director of Foreign
O erations, at a press conference in January 1954,
ca led attention to the city of Berlin as one of the
“special situations” for which ﬁnancial aid would
be requested in 1955, stating, “We contemplate
carrying on a level of economic aid necessary for
a healthy economic picture in Berlin.”
Berlln’s Economlc Sltuatlon at the End of 1953
The regress since the da s of the 1948—49 air-
lift and) the bleak winter 0 1950 has really been
more than could have been antici ated. Despite
ﬂuctuations due to seasonal and otlier reasons, un-
employment has fallen steadily since 1950 and
reached a low of 207,000 in October 1953. Indus-
trial production has doubled since 1950 and is now
about 66 percent of 1936. Exports in the same
period have been quadrupled. Increasing indus-
trial orders are being received, orders received
in December 1953 being 30 percent above Decem-
ber 1952.
Any effort to eliminate unemployment in West
Berlin is confronted with many difﬁculties. Con-
trary to earlier trends, the population of West Ber-
lin has increased in the last 4 years. Perhaps the
best measure of success, if adequate statistics were
available, would be the increase in job opportu-
nities. It is estimated, for instance, that the num-
ber of new jobs created in Berlin since 1950 has
been close to 200,000. In addition to the reduc-
tion in unemployment of about 100,000 since the
high point in 1950, some 30,000 workers formerly
employed in the East Sector of Berlin have been
absorbed in West Berlin. The number of relief
workers has also decreased by 30,000 (from 50,000
in 1950 to 20,000 in 1954). An estimated 40,000
to 50,000 of the 500,000 refugees who came into
Berlin from East Germany have also remained

to become a part of the lVest Berlin labor force.
This increase of employment represents a striking
tribute to the effectiveness of the investment
programs.
But Berlin’s economic problems cannot be said
to be solved while one worker in ﬁve is still un-
employed, while its production index is lagging
far behind West Germany, and while there is the
ever-present danger of a new inﬂux of refugees
from Soviet Germany hanging over the city.
Problem of Underemployment and
Underconsumptlon
Berlin is frequently referred to as an island.
thile emphasis is usually placed on the political
aspects of the situation of the area, se arated from
the Federal Republic and surrounde by Commu-
nist-dominated territory, there are some special
economic aspects which are of signiﬁcance for the
Berlin investment program. Restrictions on the
shipment of oods are far less serious than is some-
times thoug t, since goods can ﬂow over the
corridors to the West, in and out of Berlin, and
into the Communist East Zone. Its labor supply
and to a lesser extent its capital equipment, raw
materials, and ﬁnished ods are affected b
transport hazards and p0 itical pressures whic I
tend to make of the city an isolated entity. The
consequences of this situation for economic policy,
while somewhat overshadowed by the immediate
political roblems and recurring emergencies, are
perhaps eserving of special consideration.
The economic relationships in Berlin are in-
terestingly illustrative of some of the problems
discussed by Keynesian economists and all those
interested in the problems of underconsumption
and underemployment. There are, for instance,
in West Berlin substantial numbers of skilled as
well as unskilled workers who are unemployed.
There is underconsumption not only among the
refugees and the unemployed, but among others
on work relief, or in the lower-income brackets.
At the same time, there seems to be unbalanced
capital development, with considerable underin-
vestment in certain lines. In the city itself there
is no evidence of oversaving, but, for artiﬁcial
reasons, the consequences of oversaving appear in
the lag in the standard of living of large groups
of the people behind the economic potential for
develo ment which the city has shown.
thiYe it is not possible here in a survey of recent
investment programs to enter into an economic
study of this unique case, such a stud would be
interesting in theory and probably use 111 in prac-
tice. Even without such a study, one can tenta-
tively draw a number of conclus10ns which might
inﬂuence later action. These conclusions indicate
the importance of expanding the internal market
Berlin as an effort parallel to the expansion of
the market for Berlin goods in the West German
Republic, Europe, and the outside world. There
