ister would protest that his lan does not really
involve the sovietization of \ ’estern Germany.
I recall that in the October 1939 speech to which
I have already referred,‘ the Soviet Foreign Min-
ister explained that the mutual assistance pacts
which he had recently negotiated with Estonia,
Latvia, and Lithuania “no way implies any inter-
ference on the part of the Soviet Union .
as some foreign newspapers are trying to make
out. . . . we declare that all the nonsensical
talk about the sovietization of the Baltic coun-
tries is only to the interest of our common enemies
and all anti-Soviet provocateurs.”
The memory of what happened within a few
months to Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, and of
having seen that same pattern extend to the coun-
tries of Eastern Europe by the use of the methods
which the Soviet pro osal prescribes for Ger-
many, will, I hope, exp ain some skepticism at the
Soviet proposals for restoring freedom to
Germany.
Mr. Molotov is too intelligent to believe that the
people or government of West German would
accept his roposals or that the three estern
Powers wou d sug st that they do so. The West-
ern German Bungeestag, representing 70 percent
of the entire German people, has unanimously re-
fused to accept the East German regime as having
any legitimate status or right to speak for the
people of East Germany.
STATEMENTS OF FEBRUARY 9
Press release 82 dated February 11
First Statemnt (after 90-minute speech by Mr.
Molotov) :
Mr. Chairman, since I have heard nothing new,
I have nothing to say.
Second Statement: Mr. Chairman, I think it could
be questioned if it were said that we had not dis-
cussed the problem of security. I have just dug
out before me ﬁve speeches which I have made
around the table January 26, January 30, Februa
2, February 3, and February 4, all of which dea t
with the problem of security. I think these
speeches make clear that it is our concept of se-
curity that military establishments should be
created on a community basis where force will not
be used by the dictation of a single state or of a
single person, but only under circumstances which
unite several states in the realization of the fact
that there is a common peril from aggression.
That is our concept of security.
I have ex )ressed it practica ly every time I have
spoken with reference to this point two of the
agenda, and I would be glad, if it would serve any
useful purpose, to have reproduced the extracts
‘ For a summary of the speech transmltted to Washing-
ton by Laurence A. Stelnhardt. U. S. Ambassador at Mos-
cow. see Foreign Relations of the United States. The
Soviet Union, 1938—89, p. 786.
from these ﬁve speeches, in case they have escaped
the attention of the Soviet Foreign Minister.
The Soviet Foreign Minister has proposed that
Germany should be left a ower in the center of
Europe, with a limited natlonal force such as was
provided for by the Versailles Treaty. The pos-
sibility of Germany thus becoming a balance of
power in Europe, perhaps pla 'ing one side a ainst
the other, is not a concept which is accepta le to
the United States. And therefore, it seems to me
that on this matter also, there is a basic and
fundamental difference and nothing that was said
suggests to me that it could be reconciled. There-
fore, I strongly su )port the point of view which
has been expressed y the Foreign Minister of the
United Kingdom, which is that while these prob-
lems must beg-I think they will be—finally solved,
it will not advance us very far if we continue at
this particular conference to repeat over and over
again what has already been said. \Ve shall
have a chance to think over what has been said,
but I think it is much more useful to think over
what has been said rather than to hear it said
time after time.
The Foreign Minister may also recall that in one
of my previous interventions I referred to the fact
that we have under the United Nations a security
system which the United States, at least, does not
treat as nonexistent. It rovides, article 2, sec-
tion 4 :—“All members sha l refrain in their inter-
national relations from the threat or use of force
against the territorial integrity or olitical inde-
pendence of any state, . . .” at applies to
the United States and to all of us here.
Article 2, subdivision 6, provides :—“'I'he Or-
ganization shall ensure that states which are not
members of the United Nations act in accordance
with these principles so far as may be necessary
for the maintenance of international peace and
security.” That applies to Germany.
I do not think we should proceed here on the
assumption that these solemn agreements. that
bear our signatures. are nonexistent. It seems to
me that the subject has been dealt with as ade-
quately as we can deal with it here, and I again
repeat my endorsement of the point of view ex-
pressed by Mr. Eden.
STATEMENT OF FEBRUARY 10
Press release 64 dated February 11
Since Mr. Molotov has been kind enough to say
that the United States can be an “observer,” I
thought it would be in order to make some ob—
Servations on his plan.“
The pro sals submitted are in two parts, one
of which eals primarily with Germany and the
other of which represents the draft of a proposed
European treaty on collective security.
