the national origin of certain individuals and by
the late arrival of the Burmese observer liaison
roup at the scene of operations. This latter_ de-
ay was due to a misunderstanding of formalities
on the part of the Burmese and was rectiﬁed as
soon as the cause of the difﬁculty was discovered.
The nationality question Which arose at an early
stage of the operation when 38 men of the Shan
race presented themselves as candidates for evac-
uation still remains unsettled. A procedure how-
ever has been proposed for the handling of future
cases where nationality is contested, and it is hoped
that any further question of this nature can be
satisfactorily resolved on an ad hoc basis.
It was almost inevitable that such problems or
others like them would arise in the course of such
an extended operation as this. And still unsolved
is the question of weapons, of which only a very
few have been surrendered to date. As of No-
vember 25, 41 riﬂes, 7 carbines, 1 submachine gun,
I pistol, 1 mortar, and 167 rounds have been sur-
rendered. Today, November 27 , an additional 4
submachine guns, 1 carbine, 1 3-in. mortar were
surrendered. The committee is doing everything
it can to settle this matter. At resent, our in-
formation is that arms are being coglected at Mong
Hsat for se arate transport to Tachilek. I am
sure we all ope that these Weapons will soon be
turned over to the committee for dis sition.
Mr. Chairman, my Government lieves that
most of the procedural difﬁculties have now been
overcome. We believe there is good possibility
that in the end the number of evacuees may ex-
ceed the original] estimated ﬁgure of 2,000. But
whether this is t e case or not, and the resent
tempo of the evacuation can be maintain or ac-
celerated, we have every ho e and would express
the wish that all of the parties concerned will con-
tinue to cooperate in an eﬁort by peaceful means
and in the s irit of the charter to implement the
resolution a opted last April.
0.8. delegation press release dated December 4
Since we last met on November 27, 1953, fur-
ther developments have taken lace in connection
with the evacuation of foreign orces from Burma,
which I should like brieﬂy to review.
In a previous session I had dealt with the pat-
tern of attack on my Government demonstrated
here again this morning by the representative of
Polan . I shall not dwell on it, but he has sought
to impugn the integrity of the United States and
to minimize what is actually being done through
the efforts of the four governments concerned.
This is typical, but what cannot be denied or over-
looked is that something concrete is being accom-
plished toward the lessening of tension in Burma,
and to this accomplishment the Government of the
United States is making substantial contributions.
Let us note the facts. There has been circulated
to the members of this committee one further re-
port received from the Joint Military Commit-
tee in Ban kok " from which it will be seen that the
total nuni er of foreign forces evacuated from
Burma up to and including November 30 is 1,215.
In addition, 206 dependents have been evacuated,
bringing the grand total of troo s and dependents
already evacuated to 1,421. urther groups of
evacuees are expected to cross the Burmese-Thai
border durin" the next few days. From these
ﬁgures it willlhe seen that steady progress is being
registered in the evacuation of foreign forces from
Burma, and the outlook is that the original esti-
mated ﬁgure of 2,000 foreign forces evacuees
should soon be attained.
However, the question of the surrender of
weapons by the foreign forces still remains a prob-
lem. Although some 19 rifles and 1 submachine
gun were surrendered by the roup of 46 men and
4 women who crossed the bor er on November 30,
the total number of wea ons thus far turned over
to the Joint Military ommittee for destruction
has been disappointingly small. The Joint Mili-
tary Committee is continuin to give this impor-
tant matter its attention an is doin everything
possible to promote a satisfactory so ution. The
arms collected at Mon Hsat for separate trans-
port to Tachilek, to which I referred on November
27, have not yet been delivered. I am sure I reﬂect
the views of each and every one of us in expressing
the earnest hope that these weapons will soon be
turned over to the Joint Military Committee for
disposal.
The members of this committee will recall that
the date originally set by the Burmese Govern-
ment for the termination of the cease-ﬁre was
December 1, 1953. But it became evident that the
evacuation would not be completed by that date
and that further contin ents of foreign forces
were scheduled to leave arms. The Joint Mili-
tary Committee in Bangkok recommended an ex-
tension of the termination date of the cease-ﬁre.
Word has now been received that the Government
of Burma has agreed to extend that date to Decem-
ber 15.
I now desire to address myself to the joint reso-
lution A/C.1/L.90 Rev. 1, introduced by Australia,
Canada, India, Indonesia, New Zealand, and the
United Kingdom which is now before us."
The revisions of the original text which have
been made by the cosponsors fulfill the objectives
which we were seeking when together with Thai-
land we submitted amendments set forth in docu-
" U.N. doc. A/CJ/L. 93. Two subsequent reports were
circulated on Dec. 11 as U.N. doc. A/2627.
" The resolution urges that "efforts be continued on the
part 0! those concerned for the evacuation or internment"
ot' the foreign forces in Burma “and the surrender of all
arms." Committee I adopted the resolution on Dec. 4 by
a vote of 51—0—6 (Soviet bloc. Syria) ; the vote in plenary
session on Dec. 8 was 56-0-0. The representative of China
did not participate in either vote.
