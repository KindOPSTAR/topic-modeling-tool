clusively that the free world will stand to ether
in s ite of Soviet efforts to substitute wor for
dee s in its major objective to destroy the Western
unity which is our strength. Stalin himself, in
1929, said “It is not for nothing that the proverb
says ‘an obli 'n bear is more dan erous than an
enemy’.” T e ar has been ob igin , but be
tempted no one and he gave up none 0 his prey.
Go 01 in his masterpiece “Dead Souls” long be-
fore nin or Stalin appeared on the horizon
seemin ly forecast the Soviet attitude at the Ber-
lin con erence. His advice, which Mr. Molotov so
ably and enthusiastically followed, comes from
that wonderful character of Chichikov. Chichi-
kov said:
Remain calm, let nothing embarrass you, however bad
things may get. Never despair of anything: there is no
case that can’t be saved. . . . If you see that things are
approaching decision, don’t try to justify and defend
yourself; no, just mix things up by bringing in new ele
ments. Mix things up, and mix them up again, that’s all.
Introduce extraneous factors so that others get involved
as well as yourself. Why you can muddy the waters, if
you want, so that no one will ever be able to make head
or tail of them. And after all, your opponent only catches
crayﬁsh in muddy waters.
A ray of hope resulted from the Conference,
however, the agreement to hold talks in Geneva in
April on Korea and Indochina. And on its terms
of reference the West stood fast. Mr. Molotov’s
“concession”—as it is made to appear—on this
oint I believe is largely designed further to delay
rance’s great parliamentar decision on the rati-
ﬁcation of the European efense Community.
But, whatever the outcome at Geneva, the Western
three have remained ﬁrml united on the questions
of Germany, Austria an the Far East, and are
closer than ever before in their common point of
view.
What lessons can we learn from Berlin? I think
it is quite clear that we must continue our efforts
to strengthen the free world. We must do so in
the knowledge that Mr. Molotov and his associ-
ates for reasons made abundantly clear will not
permit the uniﬁcation of Germany in freedom or
the removal of occupation forces from Austria.
The urgent necessit for the ratiﬁcation of the
European Defense ommunity Treaty by the na-
tions concerned is now all too obvious. The pre-
vention of its entry into force was one of Russia’s
pfinii'pal objectives. The alternative sought by
r. olotov is the abandonment of Western de-
fense while the great Eurasian power retains its
full and threatening strength.
The outrageous denial of an Austrian settlement
proves clearly to me what wishful thinking has
sometimes obscured, namely, that the Soviet
leaders fear anything they do not control by force.
It is certainly not fear of Austrian military might;
Austria pledged itself to neutrality. It is the
fear of an idea, the idea of freedom. The Western
proposals for Germany, based as they were on
rinciples of free choice, were unacceptable to
ussia for the very same reason. The Soviet
leaders have, indeed denied hope for the present
to the peoples of Germany and Austria. They
have shown they fear above all to relax their severe
but uneasy grip on the areas their police power
now dominates. They fear the consequences of a
withdrawal once initiated. They are thus faced
with a terrible dilemma. They have today, I be-
lieve, a bafﬂing conﬂict of interest: on the one hand
is their internal need to bring about a relaxation
of world tensions; on the other hand they have
grave forebodings lest the very tangible acts re-
quired to roduce this relaxation may well set in
motion suc irresistible centrifugal forces in their
part-slave empire as to render recarious their own
position of internal power. urning their backs
on the Atlantic Charter to which we all subscribed
and which called for “freedom from fear” they
have forced a great part of the world to suffer the
anguish of their state of mind: “the fear of free-
om.”
In this connection, I believe, Secretary Dulles’
ﬁnal remarks at the Conference bear repeating.“
He said:
This is not the time or the place to discuss philosophies
of creeds. It is, however, important to observe that all
of our basic differences here have revolved around the
question of whether it was right, or indeed safe, to give
men and nations a genuine freedom of choice.
The Western Powers were willing to place trust in the
German and Austrian peoples. The Soviet Union was
not. . . .
The Soviet delegation, in multiple ways, has made mani-
fest its fear of freedom and its determination, through its
occupation forces and its control of election processes, to
try to make certain that freedom cannot be exercised in a
way which might be prejudicial to it.
Clearly the Kremlin did not want the Berlin
conference to result in any major a ements.
Clearly European security means to t e Soviet
Union destroying the securit of our world and
strengthening the Kremlin’s old on its satellite
states—and in fact lacing itself in position to dic-
tate to the whole 0 Europe. To the West Euro-
pean security means building peace through
cooperation of the nations.
As I said at the beginning of these thoughts I
have brought you tonighg it is in that spirit of
free coo eration, I am co dent, the nations of the
freewor dwill oforward. It is that spirit which
motivated Mr. Dulles when he said:
The three Western Ministers, each acting freely for his
sovereign and independent nation, have found agreement
on every aspect of our work. Thus we have exempliﬁed
a society of consent. If, in that spirit, our nations go on
with others of like mind, to build the strength of freedom,
then we shall win, everywhere, respect. It will be shared
by all who look to us for leadership, for we shall be guard-
ing and serving their freedom, with our own.‘
