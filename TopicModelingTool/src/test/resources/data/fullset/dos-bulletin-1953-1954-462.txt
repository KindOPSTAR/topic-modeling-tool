ices by grants and loans. In 1953, only about
15 ercent was ﬁnanced by United States aid.
est-ern Europe in particular, has made a
steady advance. European industrial and agri-
cultural production has risen to new eaks, gold
and dollar reserves have increased su tantially,
currencies have become ﬁrmer, inﬂationary res-
sures have generally leveled off, and the e ense
position of the European NATO countries has
continued to strengthen.
These achievements—tan 'ble evidence of the
successful combination of nited States aid and
the ener 'es of the European people—gradually
have ma e it possible to reduce our ass1stance to
Western Euro e as a whole. For the future, as
the Director 0 the Foreign Operations Adminis-
tration, Mr. Harold E. Stassen, noted followin his
return from the November meeting of the Minis-
ters of the Organization for European Economic
Cooperation, ‘ there is a very deﬁnite indication
that Western Euro e can maintain substantially
its current defense budgets, and at the same time
move forward on a sound economic basis with a
considerable reduction in military aid and also—
with a few exceptions—the termination of United
States economic assistance.”
The economic achievements in Europe have
permitted a proportionately greater concentration
on United States technical coo eration and special
economic aid programs in the ess developed areas
of the world. By carefully planned and properly
supported undertakings in these areas, by pin-
pomting projects on a selected priorit basis, by
more intensive effort on the part of t e partici-
pating countries, and by our own cooperative
assistance, there is every reason to believe that
the peoples of the underdevelo ed countries will
lift themselves onto much hig er levels of eco-
nomic well-being.
IXPAIOID TECHNICAL COOPERATION
A world-wide technical cooperation program
has been developed and expanded by the Foreign
Operations Administration to meet the need for a
long-range and relatively economical method of
ca ing out United States policy objectives for
wor d stability. During the last 6 months, re-
cruitment of qualiﬁed technicians has improved,
and the United States now has more specialists in
the ﬁeld than ever before. These professional
eXperts, working on the spot and close to the
problems at hand, are imparting knowledge of
modern methods to the people of the less devel-
oped areas. Through increasingly productive co-
operative relationships and individual contacts,
the foundation to future progress in the under-
developed areas is being laid. Present plans
project an expanding program of technical co-
operation, with economic aid, where it is essential,
carefully geared into the objectives of the various
individual projects.
There are good and compelling reasons why
technical cooperation operations must be lanned
and executed within the overall framewor of the
total United States effort to help promote world
progress. In most areas, the effectiveness of a
technical cooperation program is closely involved
with important economic considerations. In some
countries, such as Bolivia, for example, technical
cooperation must be related to the problem of
diversifying a sin le-industry economy. In other
countries, such as ndia, the technical cooperation
In has to be lanned with a view to the
ultimate effects on t e labor force, particularly
with regard to possible increases in unem loyment
or disrupting shifts as between agricu ture and
industry.
Integration of technical and economic measures
for planning and operating purposes increases the
eﬁectiveness of each component, and thereby the
impact of the total program. This does not imply
subordination or amalgamation so that the tech-
nical cooperation pro ams lose the enormous
good will they have bui t up over the ears. There
continues to be a clear-cut technica coo eration
program in each country taking part in t e tech-
nical coo eration effort.
The e ectiveness of the technical cooperation
program is being further enhanced by enlargin
the opportunities for United States colleges and
universities to articipate directly in country
projects. The oreign Operations Administra-
tion is assisting American universities to develop
local technical centers in the host country; there
are currently 30 universities under contract in 17
countries.
Some of these contracts are directly with the
Foreign Operations Administration; others are
with the local universities of the foreign countries.
As part of the effort to increase the participation
of United States colleges and universities in tech-
nical coo ration programs, arrangements are
being ma e to extend contracts over a three-year
period. United States institutions would be
encouraged to assist foreign institutions in such
ﬁelds as agriculture, health, education, public
administration, and engineering.
AIO, TRADE, AND U.S. IOONOIIO "Ill-Tl!
Expanded world trade is of vital importance in
the effort to build greater world stability and
ultimately remove the requirements for large-scale
United States assistance. As the previous Report
to Congress on the Mutual Security Program'
ointed out, the American economy cannot be
'vorced from the world economy. That re ort
gave speciﬁc instances to show that America’s
great roductive ca acity could not be long main-
tain , let alone en ar d, without the vast quan-
tities of basic materia 5 provided by other coun-
