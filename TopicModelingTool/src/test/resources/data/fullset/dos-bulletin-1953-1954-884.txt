Throughout the world this legislative proceed-
ing is being followed with unusual interest. For-
eign statesmen and soldiers are waitin to see
whether the United States, through this ongress,
will follow through with its program to make
atomic armaments a art of the wea ons systems
of the alliances in w ich the United) States is a
partner. Scientists and engineers of friendly na-
tions are also waiting to see if America Will be
willing to open up some of its peacetime nuclear
technology in return for raw materials and other
advantages ﬂowing to the United States. Perha s
most si iﬁcant of all, however, are the hundre
of millions of people in the world who, having
heard of the promise of atomic energy, wait
eagerly to see if there are beneﬁts in it for them
in addition to the military shield which has held
oﬁ the aggressive forces of Soviet communism for
almost a decade. The military atom is a fear-
some thing, even to those who owe their liberties
to it. The constructive use of atomic energy
could promote both peace and plenty, and so holds
a special place in man’s dream of the future.
The hills which your Committee is considering
need to be enacted if our nation is to serve its own
interests and at the same time to show the world
anew that our national interests harmonize with
the interests of men everywhere.

TREATY INFORMATION



Signing of Supplementary Tax
Protocol With United Kingdom
Press release 282 dated May 25
On May 25 Secretary Dulles and the British
Ambassador, Sir Roger Makins, signed a supple-
mentary protocol amending the income-tax con-
vention 0 April 16, 1945, as amended by the sup-
plementary protocol of June 6, 1946.
The 1945 convention relates to the avoidance of
double taxation. The provisions of article XXII
set forth a procedure by which the convention ma
be extended to overseas territories. Those row-
sions, for example, would make it possible fgr the
British Government to 've this Government a
formal notiﬁcation of a esire that the 1945 con-
vention, as amended, apply to “all or any of its
colonies, overseas territories, protectorates, or ter-
ritories in respect of which it exercises a. mandate,
which impose taxes substantially similar in char-
acter to those which are the subject” of the conven-
tion. A period of 60 days from the date of that
notiﬁcation is allowed for this Government to act
with respect to the notiﬁcation. In the absence of
a speciﬁc rejection by this Government, the ex-
tended ap lication would be automatic at the end
of the period of 60 days. Moreover, the entire con-
vention would apply, no provision being made for
modifying or eliminating any of the convention’s
provisions so far as the territories are concerned.
As a result of action taken, and policies ex-
pressed, by the Senate in approving income-tax
conventions with certain other countries in 1948,
1951, and 1952, having the effect of deleting or
modifyin certain provisions similar to proviswns
which ha been approved in the United Kingdom
convention, it became necessary to consider an
amendment of the territorial-extension provisions
in article XXII of the 1945 convention with the
United Kingdom.
The new supplementar protocol has only one
substantive article, where y the territorial-exten-
sion procedure provided in article XXII of the
1945 convention is amended so that (a) no limita-
tion of time is placed on action by either Govern-
ment in taking action with respect to a notiﬁcation
from the other, (6) certain provisions of the con-
vention could be deleted or modiﬁed so far as ex-
tension to articular colonies or other territories
is concerne , and (a) no extension would be eﬁ'ec-
tive until formally accepted by the Government
receiving the notiﬁcation. In these respects, the
rotocol makes the convention with the United
ingdom consistent, so far as territorial-extension
provisions are concerned, with corresponding pro-
visions in tax conventions between the United
States and certain other countries.
The supplementary rotocol will be transmitted
to the Senate for its a vice and consent to ratiﬁca-
tion. According to its terms, it will become an
integral part of the convention when brought into
force by the exchange of instruments of ratiﬁca-
tion.
