must also shape our policy and so conduct our daily
acts as to represent the interests of the majority
of our people where vital issues affecting our own
security are concerned. I am certain no American
would quarrel with this concept.
What I allude to is that a pro-Israeli, or a pro-
Arab olicy, has no place in our thinking. What
your overnment strives to put into effect is a
policy (I quote the President) of “sympathetic
and impartial friendship” to all the states in the
Middle East. Neither Side, we believe, at the mo-
ment thinks that this can be true. Both now be-
lieve we are partial to the other. Both tend to
be guided by the Biblical statement: “He that is
not with me is against me.” It is difﬁcult, close
to im ossible, for them to understand that we can
be friends to both and yet be impartial in our
policies.
It may be difﬁcult and it may take long, but I am
certain you will a ree with me that we should so
conduct ourselves in the area as to clearly demon-
strate that our government has nothing except a
truly objective policy. If we are to be accused of
being “pro” anything, let us make it amply clear
that that preﬁx can only apply to one thing, and
that is that our policy is ﬁrst and foremost “pro-
American.”
Speciﬁc problems of this issue are of great in-
terest such as the refugee situation, border delinea-
tion, matters of com ensation, the status of J eru-
salem, an equitable ivision of the vital waters of
the Jordan, etc., etc. These are matters which
would cover many times the allotted time I have
here this evening. We will 'udge each of these
major issues and each daily friction that may arise
on its merits as we see them and work unceasingly
for a reconciliation which we believe to be in the
best interests of all.
I shall only draw two conclusions on this situa-
tion this evening.
To the Israelis I say that you should come to
truly look upon yourselves as a Middle Eastern
State and see your own future in that context
rather than as a headquarters, or nucleus so to
speak, of worldwide groupings of eoples of a
particular religious faith Who must ave special
rights within and obligations to the Israeli state.
You should drop the attitude of the conqueror
and the conviction that force and a policy of re-
taliatory killings is the only policy that your neigh-
bors Wlll understand. You should make your
deeds correspond to your frequent utterance of
the desire for peace.
To the Arabs I say you should accept this State
of Israel as an accomplished fact. I say further
that you are deliberately attempting to maintain
a state of affairs delicately suspended between
peace and war, while at present desiring neither.
This is a most dangerous policy and one which
world opinion will increasingly condemn if you
continue to resist any move to obtain at least a
less dangerous modus m'vendi with your neighbor.
The Broader Issues
Turning away from the s eciﬁc again to broader
issues, you will readily rea ize that in the issue I
have just described the United States is somewhat
in the “middle.” This is also true in many of the
other disputes in the area, some of which I enumer-
ated a few minutes ago. Diﬂicult as the position
of being in the middle may be on the issue I have
just described, it is even more delicate in some of
the other disputes. This is true as some of these
disputes are between friendly states of the area
and major allies of the United States. In such
cases one cannot jud e the overall interests of the
United States entire by what a pear to be the
merits of the particufar issue loca ly. As an ex-
ample, the North African situation has worldwide
ramiﬁcations. On the one hand we see it affect-
ing interests which France believes vital to her
continued role as a world power and as affecting
her role in matters of great importance to the
United States, such as French Indochina and the
development of an integrated Europe. On the
other, we see, in the struggle for freedom in North
Africa, the seeds of dissension which affect the
position of the West in the entire Moslem world,
which spreads from Morocco to Indonesia. All
this is in addition to merits or demerits of the
effect of French policy in the local area. This
illustration of the worldwide ramiﬁcations of
local problems could be extended if we should
substitute E ypt and Iran for North Africa and
the United in dom for France.
The United tates must consider with great
care the implications of throwing whatever in-
ﬂuence we may have in such situations to one side
or the other. Such a choosing of sides is often
diﬂicult in any event as, being outside parties, we
can see merits on each side of the issue.
Our role in these cases is to attempt to assist
both parties to arrive at an arrangement which
both sides would accept as satisfactory. The fact
that there be solutions of this nature to these dis-
putes, under present world conditions, is often
more important to the United States than the terms
of that solution.
This is a role in which one cannot expect
popularity and certainly one which we have not ac-
cepted with pleasure. When nations of the area
become impatient because the United States does
not more fully support the causes of their own
nationalism, we might ask them to think of the
historical signiﬁcance of the fact that the United
States, in the span of a few short years, has moved
to where it is playinrr such a middle role. They
must realize that in the end, however, their long-
range interests cannot be served if the United
States overplays such a role to the point of en-
dangering the great NATO organization that is
today the only organized strength of the free
world against Soviet encroachment.
The analogy was recently put forward by one
of our diplomatic representatives that the pres-
