that has been publicly said by the President and
me as to the conditions, which as I say have been
stable and unchanging over a considerable period
of time, under which such intervention would be
considered possible. Of course, let me make clear
that one of the conditions which we have always
stood on is that there must be congressional sanc-
tion to any such action.

The Growth of Freedom in India
by George V. Allen
Ambassador to India 1
India was a faraway land, relatively unlmown
to most Americans, until World War II, when
thousands of American G. L’s went there and
served there because it was next door to Burma,
which was occupied by the Japanese. Before the
War it was known by American missionaries in-
timately, and by a few American businessmen,
and many of us had learned something about India
because of the prominence of Mahatma Gandhi
and his ﬁrst lieutenant, J awaharlal Nehru, who
were the leaders of India’s struggle for independ-
ence. The United States had consular representa-
tives in India more than a hundred years ago, but
it has really been only since the war that India
has loomed very lar e in American thinking.
Today, India is t e largest democracy in the
world, _W1th more than 360 million people. Today,
Indla is an independent republic with a consti-

relation to Southeast Asia. On the military side
there have been plans for consultations both in
relation to Thailand, where their military position
is being reviewed, and Secretary Wilson is in
Manila and is having conversations there with the
Philippine Government with respect to its mili-
tary positions. Some of his military advisers are
there with him.
There have been some suggestions about discus-
sions between the three Anzus owers, that is,
Australia, the United States, an New Zealand,
and also bringing in the United Kingdom and
France. There has been no ﬁnal decision on that
matter as yet, but conversations as to that possi-
bility are being considered. I want to emphasize,
however, that these military talks are in no sense
in substitution for political conversations which
are continuing to 0 on. Nor are these ﬁve-power
military talks, if t ey take place, in an sense ex-
clusive. As I emphasized, there are a so similar

Gandhi has passed on, but Mr. ehru is India’s
Prime Minister, and he is still working to achieve
the beneﬁts for his country that India considers
its due as a sovereign nation. That India is inde-
pendent is not doubted by us or by any Indian,
except perhaps by the Communists in India and
elsewhere who profess to believe, curiously, that
independence is real only if a country’s internal
and foreign policies are the same as those of the
Soviet Union. Certainly we Americans are aware
of Indian independence. But Indians and Ameri-
cans alike are often puzzled by the fact that our
two countries have recently differed sharply over
foreign affairs.
Indians are puzzled because they consider that
they are exercising1 their right to independent
views—exercising t at independence—which the
United States has always su ported. They recall
that America supported ndia’s independence
movement, not in a material way, but in a moral
and political wa . Our stock was very high in
