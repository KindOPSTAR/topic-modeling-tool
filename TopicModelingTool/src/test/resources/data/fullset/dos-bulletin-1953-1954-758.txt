White House press release dated May 13
Presldent Eisenhower
I am very happy, in the presence of this distin-
guished company, to sign this bill.
I think it is particularly fortunate that we have
with us the Ambassador from Canada, because this
bill is intended to set in motion the great project
which will operate to the beneﬁt of both our
countries.
This marks, of course, the legislative culmina-
tion of an effort that has taken 30 years to reach
this point. Now work can begin on the great
project itself. That work, we all hope, willipro-
gress ra idly without interruption to a successful
completion, so that the beneﬁts of this great
project can come to all our people on both sides
of that great river.
Senator Wlloy
Mr. President, I want to congratulate you. His-
tory will now record that at lon last the dream—
%1915,dtl16 hope, of countless mil ions is being ful-
e .
Back of us stands the Ambassador of Canada.
It is a symbol that we are united in the greatest
effort the two nations ever undertook in building
a waterway here that will mean happiness, health,
and prosperity for countless millions to come.
Across the river we have held hands. Now we
cannot part. We are one in a great adventure—to
build for the future of America.
I congratulate you and the American people.
Senator Ferguson
Mr. President, Mr. Ambassador, Members of
Congress: This is really a great occasion. I know
it will be historic because it is a symbol of friend-
ship between the United States and our friend,
Canada, to the north.
Comin from Michigan, one of the border
States, this has been a dream for many years. Mr.
President, when we look at this map we can see
that soon transportation can come into the heart-
land of America. Transportation, whether it be
by ship, plane, railroad, truck, or automobile, is
the lifeblood of commerce and trade. And I know
that history will say that we today were looking
into the future.
It means a better United States and a better
world, I am sure. This occasion is reall one that
we can all be happy about—that this a ministra-
tion could bring this about.
Ropresentatlvo Dondero
Mr. President, the people of the United States,
through their Congress, have determined that they
will participate with their good neighbor to the
north, Canada, in the construction of the St.
Lawrence Seaway. It has been the dream of many
decades. It is one of the greatest waterways in
the world and will be one of the great arteries of
commerce in the world. I think that it will con-
tribute much to the economic welfare and also to
the national defense of both the United States and
Canada.
Mr. President, ﬁve of your predecessors advo-
cated and endorsed the building of the St. Law-
rence Seaway. It has been delayed 30 or 40 years,
and now under your great leadership this mighty
roject, the master project of the North American
IContinent, is to become a reality.
I want to add just one more thought, and that is
this: that in the days to come, the American peo-
ple, the Canadian people, the Continent of North
America, will receive great beneﬁt from what we
are doing now.
I am proud to be a Member of the 83d Congress,
to have had some part in bringing this very happy
day about, as Chairman of the Committee on Pub-
lic Works of the House of Representatives.
To you, Mr. President, and your administration,
must go the credit for bringing about the begin-
ning of this great project. Only one thing re-
mains now, to make the seaway an assured fact,
and that is your signature to the bill before you.
