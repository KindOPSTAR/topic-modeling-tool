cerning economic aid. All of these three ups
function directl under the supervision an direc-
tion of the Am assador. Probably the phase of
the Spanish aid program most interesting to this
active industrial center is the economic aspect.
The man who is administering this vital part of
our program is Edward L. Williams, here with
me today. Also present today are Homer B ing-
ton, the new Counselor of the Embassy and or-
ace Smith Deputy Director of the erations
Mission. The group working under Mr. illiams
will develop the economic and technical-assistance
program in cooperation with the Interminis-
terial Coordinating Commission of the Spanish
Government.
You all have had the op ortunity to acquaint
yourselves with the details 0 the agreements which
were signed nearly 5 months ago, but I think it
would be timely now to review some of the basic
concepts to which both Governments have agreed.
Perhaps one of the most important, and one which
our own Government has stressed, is the mutual-
ity of the obligations and responsibilities assumed
by both parties. Each side receives certain deﬁ-
nite advanta es in return for those granted the
other. The ull recognition of this concept has
been extremely helpful in the planning stage of
this joint program, which is now virtually ﬁn-
ished, and will serve as a keystone to our new re-
lationship as we enter the o eratin phase.
I believe that we can both prou of what has
been accomplished. With respect to defense sup-
port for Spain, the ﬁrst items of American aid ar—
rived last week, consisting of military equipment
for Spain’s three armed forces and inc uding tanks
and guns. As for base construction, the rims
contractors have been named in the United tates
and their ﬁrst representatives have already arrived
in S sin to select qualiﬁed Spanish com anies
which will collaborate with them in this wor vital
both to the defense of S ain and to the United
States. It is expected t at the American com-
anies will maintain relatively few technicians
liere and that they will select through bidding
Spanish ﬁrms to do much of the actual construc-
tion. The Spanish companies and personnel will
articipate to the maximum extent possible in this
building rogram, which will cover quite a long
eriod. This operation will, we hope, stimulate
usiness activity and provide greater employment
throughout Spain.
It is appropriate today to discuss some aspects
of the economic agreement which we should all
know. For example, what part will dollars play
in this program?
As a matter of fact, dollars will not be sent
directly to Spain, although aid for the ﬁrst year
of the assistance program is calculated at $85
million in economic aid and $141 million in mili-
tary aid. In addition, the cost of the construction
of the bases and naval facilities this ﬁrst year is
expected to be about $60 million although the
total will be much larger. These are impressive
ﬁgures, but what we are actually talking about is
material, goods, and uipment. The milita -
aid funds will be spent or equipment such as ill,
items which have just arrived. Under the eco-
nomic pro m the dollars will be s at for
Spain’s agriculture, transportation, and industry.
And, most important, these things will come to
Spain only after careful study and planning of
the relative riorities of Spanish requirements
on the speci 0 request of your Government and
after approval by the S anish Interministerial
Commissmn and our Sperations Mission in
Madrid. No material whatever will be brought
to Spain that is not fully in accord with this jomt
program.
I would like to render a brief accounting of
the economic aid program to date. The entire
ﬁrst $11 million, announced last fall, has been
programed for raw materials including scrap
copper, aluminum, cotton, rubber, and steel, and
for urgently needed agricultural equipment.
Plans are near] complete for the programing—a
technical wordy which means “authorizing to
spend”—of an additional $20 million, most of
which will also be for raw materials. As on can
readily see, these raw materials are irected
quickly into Spanish industry and hel to main-
tain high productive and employment levels.
Opportunltlos for Technical Asslstaneo
One of the little- ublicized parts of the eco-
nomic agreement is t at pertaining to roductiv-
ity and technical assistance. In this eld there
is a great opportunity for exchange of ideas and
sharing of information and experience. To cite
one example brieﬂy technical assistance is avail-
able in the ﬁelds of soil conservation, sslands
control, and irrigation. As on know, t e United
States has large areas in e Southwest which
suffer from erosion and recurrent droughts, as do
certain parts of Spain. Much progress has been
made in combatin these problems, and it is be-
lieved that both pain and the United States
would roﬁt from an exchange of s ecialists who
know t 1e latest techniques in these elds. Under
such a program some of your technicians would
go to my countr while at the same time American
specialists woul come to Spain.
As a matter of fact, you have already given us
some technical assistance. Outstanding leaders
in the ﬁelds of learnin and medicine have come
from Spain to the United States and made dis-
tinguished contributions to our culture. It might
not be inap ropriate for me to mention the Span-
ish shephe s who have one to the United States
from this ve region an given dramatic evidence
of the rug e ess, honesty, and patience charac-
teristic of t e people of this part of Spain. These
are examples of technical assistance, of sharing
with each other special skills in one ﬁeld or
another.
