pendence. It a eared that the European owers
ou d in the oly Alliance contempla help-
ing pain to recover her former colonies, and some
even considered the possibility of establishing new
colonies on the American Continent. These ideas
had their ins iration in a desire not only to regain
the material neﬁts of empire, but also to check
the owth of republican institutions in the West-
ern orld. This ulterior political motive gave
added color to the apprehension of the U.S. at the
plans of the Holy l iance.
President Monroe’s message of December 2,
1823, expressed the special interest of the U.S.
in the affairs of this hemisphere as contrasted
with those of Europe. He declared that the U.S.
would consider it dangerous to our peace and
safety for the allied powers to attempt to extend
their “essentiall different” political system to an
portion of this emisphere. This count woul ,
moreover, view any attempt to subject t e inde-
pendent Latin American States once more to
colonization as the manifestation of an unfriendly
disposition toward the United States.
The Monroe Doctrine was, of course, entirely a
unilateral declaration by the U.S. Its enunciation
involved us in no commitment to other countries.
It was essentially a warning to non-American %W-
ers that they would court danger from the .S.
if they attempted either of the two acts which the
Doctrine declared to be a ainst our interests. Dur-
ing the ensuing century t e U.S. on some occasions
took vigorous action in support of the Monroe
Doctrine, and at other times virtually disregarded
it.
At approximately the same time there was
lanted in Latin America the germ of a somewhat
Hiﬂ'erent idea, namel , a plan of alliance and mu-
tual defense among t e independent Latin Ameri-
can nations. This was an important feature of the
proposals made by Simdn Bolivar to the Confer-
ence of Panama held in 1826. Bolivar envisaged a
federation of Latin American countries, with
which the U.S. would be associated in defensive
alliance. Rejected by the Latin American coun-
tries themselves, the idea remained a dream for
more than a century. It constituted, however, an
important precedent inﬂuencing the development
of the pan-American movement which has brought
forth the Treaty of Rio de J aneiro and the Charter
of the Organization of American States.
While the ideas of Bolivar remained germinat-
ing in the soil of Latin American juridical dis-
cussion, the U.S. proceeded with the assumption
of its unilateral responsibility for the defense of
the continent. It assumed also a responsibility
for the maintenance of peace within the Americas
insofar as this latter purpose was necessary to the
achievement of the former. In the early part of
the 20th century the strong arm of the U.S. made
itself felt with increasing vigor in the Caribbean
and Central American areas.
The Theodore Roosevelt Corollary
President Theodore Roosevelt formulated the
so-called Roosevelt corollary to the Monroe Doc-
trine. The theor of his policy was that if the
U.S. wished to cop European nations out of
American affairs, it was necessa for the U.S. to
maintain sufficient order and stability in the Amer-
icas so that the European owers would have no
justiﬁcation to intervene. practice this meant
that the U.S. would intervene in order to prevent
intervention by others.
We need not 0 into the history of U.S. inter-
vention in the Caribbean and Central American
countries and in Mexico for the urpose of enforc-
ing what we believed to be or erly government.
Sufﬁce it to say that these measures, taken in full
recognition of the fact that, under international
law, intervention to protect the lives and property
of our nationals was recognized as a justiﬁable
recourse when orderl systems of law had proved
inadequate, promote in Latin America a violent
reaction. T e Latin American Republics focused
their attention not upon the dangers of European
intervention, but upon violation of their national
sovereign’iy and territorial integrity by the United
States. he paramount issue, therefore, in the
development of an inter-American security sys-
tem from the Latin American standpoint, grew to
be the develo ment of arantees a ainst the inter-
vention of t e Unite States in atin American
affairs.
By the late 1920’s the U.S., in recognition of
this demand from Latin America, and seeing the
advantages of a more cooperative relationship
with the Latin American countries, began to alter
its approach. The Roosevelt corollary to the
Monroe Doctrine was abandoned. Gradually, the
U.S. ceased its intervention in the aﬂ'airs of its
southern neighbors. By 1936 the nonintervention
policy was ormally accepted by the U.S. in a
treaty ratiﬁed with the approval of the Senate.
So strong, however, was the sentiment in favor
of nonintervention among the Latin American
countries that its acceptance by the U.S. in treaty
form by no means terminated the constant in-
sistence of Latin American States upon this theme.
The fear of U.S. intervention, despite now some
20 years of faithful observance of the noninter-
vention doctrine, is still not fully laid. It was a
major feature of the debate at the Tenth Inter-
American Conference, held last March in Caracas,
over the newest development in the continental
security policy: namely, the resolution on commu-
nism. Of this we shall speak more fully later on.
Concurrently with the development of the non-
intervention principle, however, another concept
was in process of formation that would place the
whole continental security in a new light. This
was the development of collective responsibility
for the maintenance of continental peace and
security.
