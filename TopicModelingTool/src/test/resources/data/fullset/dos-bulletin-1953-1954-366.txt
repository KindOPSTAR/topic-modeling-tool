Although the activities of the Board and its reg-
istrants were necessarily restricted by military re-
quirements and the controls of a war economy, the
patriotism inspired by the war made for unity and
cooperation in organized voluntary effort. In this
respect signal success was achieved by the organi-
zation of the National \Var Fund, the United J ew-
ish Appeal, and the United National Clothing
Collection.
The National War Fund, under the residency
of Winthrop Aldrich, was established) early in
1943 on the Board’s initiative, and with President
Roosevelt’s approval, to raise funds for domestic
and foreign war-related agencies. State war
funds were established in each State, with local
campaigns in most communities combined with
Community Chests. President Roosevelt, in giv-
in his ap roval, said on January 11, 1943: “It
wi l contri ute greatly to our unity, enthusiasm,
and powers in the war effort.” The Fund was
eminently successful in raising the greatest
amount of money given to charity by any people
in the world. In particular, the joint use of the
established local fund-raising facilities of the
Community Chests was a major factor in reducing
both the cost and confusion of solicitation. The
major Jewish charities, acting jointly as the
United Jewish Appeal, were no less successful;
they too achieved maximal economy in the raising
of funds intended to meet the greatly expanded
relief needs of Jewish war victims. Another ex-
ample of joint effort was the campaign successfully
carried out in 1945 and 1946 by the United Na-
tional Clothing Collection. The greater part of
the clothing collected was distributed abroad
through the registered agencies.
With the encouragement of the Board, the prin-
cipal voluntary relief agencies, representing both
secular and reli 'ous interests, furthered coordi-
nation among t emselves through the establish-
ment in 1943 of a federation, the American Coun-
cil of Voluntary Agencies for Foreign Service.
The work of the Council (which is still active with
a membership of 45 agencies) was carried out, not
as an executive organization but largely through
functional, country, regional, and ad hoc commit-
tees, to afford means to develop a consensus on mat-
ters of common concern to the member bodies.
These committees, made up of member agencies
of wide and varied experience, were of continu-
ing service to the interested agencies of the Gov-
ernment. Their activities were supplemented
abroad by councils of American agencies operat-
ing in France, Germany, Austria, Greece, Italy,
India, Japan, and Korea, in collaboration with the
respective governments and indigenous agencies
of these countries.
Despite the greatly increased volume of relief,
the President’s Board during the period of its ad-
ministration reduced progressively the number of
registered agencies from an initial 223 in 1942 at
the time of its establishment to 90 in 1945, gener-
ally by persuasion, sometimes by hearings, and
occasionally by invoking the police powers dele-
ated to it by the President’s Executive order.
The marked reduction in the number of appeals to
the public reﬂected the value of the control rec-
ommended b Secretary Hull in 1941.
The stimu us of the participation of the United
States in active war, 1942-1945, greatly acceler-
ated the resources made available to the registered
a encies in support of their overseas o erations.
Tiey received $251 million in funds an goods to
the value of $186 million, a total of $437 m_11hon.
The greater part of the resources, it is signiﬁcant
to note, were contributed by the public to the Na-
tional War Fund, the United Jewish Appeal, and
the United National Clothing Collection. The
value of the voluntary exports of funds and oods
of the agencies registered with the Presi ent’s
Board was $413.7 million, about 29 percent of the
total voluntary exports for the whole period
1939-1953. .
Relief to British, French, Dutch, Norwegian,
Greek, Czech, Yugoslav, Polish, Italian, Pal-
estinian, Russian, and Chinese war-sufferers was
greatly increased in value. China and the Soviet
Union as wartime allies received a marked 1ncrease
in voluntary relief as adjuncts to lend-lease. _
Upon the conclusion of active warfare in
Europe, the War Relief Control Board suggested
to the President that the licensing of sollcltations
by voluntary relief organizatlons, originally
adopted as a war measure, was no longer desirable
as a function of the Federal Government. The
Board’s recommendation was made in reoognltlon
of the probability (later substantiated) that war
relief, especially foreign aid, would continue in
substantial volume for some time. It urged that
some functions, such as the maintenance of a pub-
lic record of the identity and activities of organi-
zations engaged in foreign relief ‘and the neces-
sary liaison and facilitating services, should be
continued for the time being l'iy peacetime de-
partments of the Government. he President ac-
cepted the Board’s recommendation and on May
14, 1946, issued Executive Order 9723 terminating
its existence.‘
The Postwar Years: 1946-1953
The liberation of the war-bound countries after
V—E and V—J Days opened u wider channels _for
a ﬂow of food, clothing, me icines, and hospital

appeals for help followed, particularly from dls-
tressed persons in Austria, Germany,_Greece, and
Italy to their kinsfolk and friendsun America.
Help was also asked for refugees 111 Denmark,
Sweden, Spain, and Portugal, as well as ‘for
