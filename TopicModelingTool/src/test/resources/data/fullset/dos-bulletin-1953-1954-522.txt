minimize it. It was a very large blast, but at no
time was the testin out of control. The misa pre-
hension seems to iave arisen due to two acts.
First, that the yield was about double that of the
calculated estimate—a margin of error not incom-
patible with a totally new weapon. (The range of
guesses on the ﬁrst A bomb covered a relatively
ar wider spectrum.) Second, because of the re-
sults of the “fall-out.”
When a large ex losion occurs on or within a
certain distance of t e ground, an amount of earth
or water or whatever is beneath the center of the
explosion is sucked up into the air. The heavy
articles fall out uickly. The lighter ones are
me away in the direction of the wind until they
too settle out. If the explosion is a nuclear one,
many of these particles are radioactive, as are the
va orized parts of the weapon itself.
‘or this reason the Atomic Energy Commission
has conducted the tests of its lar r weapons away
from the mainland so that the fa l-out would occur
-in the ocean, where it would be quickly dissipated
both by dilution and b the rapid decay of most
of the radioactivity which is of short duration.
The Marshall Islands were selected for the site
of the ﬁrst large-scale tests—Operation Cross-
roads—for reasons which will be a )arent from
the ma 5 which I shall show you. he late Adm.
W. H. . Blandy, under whom I had the privilege
of serving, selected the Bikini site.
The Marshall Islands during the months of
February, March, and A ril are usually favored
by winds which would b ow away from any in-
habited atolls. The two atolls of Bikini and
Eniwetok were chosen as the base for these opera-
tions. Each of these atolls is a large necklace of
coral reef surrounding a lagoon two to three hun~
dreds of uare miles in area, and at various points
on the rec , like beads on a string, appear a multi-
tude of little islands, some a few score acres in
extent—others no more than sands its. It is these
small, uninhabited, treeless sand ars which are
used for the experiments. As a matter of fact, the
Task Force dredged u enough sand and coral to
build one of these so-ca led islands to have it where
it was wanted most advantageously for shot num-
ber one. The impression that an entire atoll or
even large islands have been destroyed in these
tests is erroneous. It would be more accurate to
say a large sandspit or reef.
Before the shot takes place, there is a careful
survey of the winds at all elevations up to many
thousands of feet. This survey is conducted by
weather stations on islands and on ﬂeet units at
widely separated points. Contrary to general be-
lief, winds do not blow in only one direction at a
given time and place. At various heights above
the earth, winds are found to be blowing fre-
quently in opposite directions and at greatly vary-
ing speeds. An atomic cloud is therefore sheared
by these winds as it rises through them. The
meteorologists attempt to forecast the wind direc-
tion for the optimum condition, and the Task
Force Commander thereupon decides on the basis
of the weather reports, when the test shall be made.
The weather forecast is necessarily long-range be-
cause a warning area must be searched for ship-
ping and the search which is carried out both
visually and by radar in PQV Navy planes requires
a day or more to complete.
The “warning area” is an area surrounding the
provin grounds within which it is determined
that a hazard to shipping or aviation exists. \Ve
have established many such areas, as have other
overnments. This ma ) shows such areas 011' the
aciﬁc Coast at Point hiagu, and off the Hawaiian
Islands. Here is a large guided-missile warning
area from Florida across the Bahamas. Here is
one maintained by Great Britain off Australia.
Including our continental warning areas, we have
established a total of 447 such warning and/or
danger areas. This particular warning area was
ﬁrst established in 1947. The United Nations were
advised, and ap ropriate notices were carried then
and subsequent y in marine and aircraft naviga-
tional manuals.
With respect to the apprehension that fall-out
radioactivity would move toward Japan on the
Japanese Current, I can state that any rodioactiv-
ity falling into the test area would become harm-
less within a few miles after being icked up by
these currents, which move slowly ( ess than one
mile per hour), and would be completely unde-
tectible within 500 miles or less.
With respect to a story which received some
currency last week to the effect that there is dan-
ger of a fall-out of radioactive material in the
United States, it should be noted that after every
test we have had and the Russian tests as well
there is a small increase in natural “background”
radiation in some localities within the continental
United States, but, currently, it is less than that
observed after some of the revious continental
and overseas tests, and far be ow the levels which
could be harmful in any way to human beings,
animals, or crops. It Will decrease rapidly after
the tests until the radiation level has returned
approximately to the normal background.
A recent comment which I have been shown has
suggested that the incident involving the fall-out
on inhabited areas was actually a planned part of
the operation. I do not wish to comment on this
other than to characterize it as utterly false, irre-
sponsible, and gravely unjust to the men engaged
in this atriotic service.
Final y, I would say that one important result
of these hydrogen bomb developments has been
the enhancement of our military capability to the
point where we should soon be more free to in-
crease our emphasis on the eaceful uses of atomic
wer—at home and abroa . It will be a tremen-
ggus satisfaction to those who have participated in
this program that it has hastened t at day.
