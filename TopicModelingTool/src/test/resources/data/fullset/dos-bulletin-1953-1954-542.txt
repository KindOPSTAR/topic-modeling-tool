Israeli Complaint Against Egypt
Regarding Shipping Restrictions
Statement by Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.
US. Representative to the United Nations ‘
U.S./U.N. press release dated March 25
The issue before us is the compliance of a valued
member of the United Nations with a decision
taken 2% years ago by the highest body of this
organization charged with the maintenance of
international peace and security. After examin-
in the facts and arguments presented by both
si es, this Council adopted a resolution on Se -
tember 1, 1951,2 which continues to apply to t e
facts as we have heard them relatin to the com-
plaint now under consideration. T e resolution
of 1951 was adopted after the parties themselves
had entered into a general armistice agreement
which had as one of its principal purposes the
promotion of permanent peace in Pa estine. The
resolution stems from that agreement. The basic
issues are the same as those considered then, and
in our opinion, nothin has happened since 1949,
when the Armistice greement was signed, or
since 1951, when the resolution was adopted, to
alter their validity or signiﬁcance to the peace of
the area.
Throughout the history of the Palestine Ques-
tion the United Nations has sought a peaceful,
just, and agitable settlement of the many com-
licated pro lems arising out of the Palestine con-
ict. The decisions of the various organs of the
United Nations have not always satisﬁed our own
views 100 percent. But we have consistently
’ Made in the Security Council on Mar. 25.
' U.N. doc. S/2298/Rev. 1.
sought to respect and give effect to the combined
judgment which those decisions represent. \Ve,
for our part, feel that the parties directly con-
cerned in these questions have an ual duty to
respect and make eve reasonable e ort to give
effect to the combine judgment of the United
Nations, whether expressed in the Security Coun-
cil or in the General Assembly, or other competent
organs. We must say frank] that the desire of
the interested parties to do so as not always been
apparent. If, disregarding the collective efforts
0 the United Nations, the parties bring the house
down upon themselves it is they who will suffer
most. This may seem ike a strong statement, but
candor compels it.
When the United Nations was established, such
situations as these were the reason why we com-
bined together to 001 some of our resources and
to subject some 0 our interests to the judgment
of the majority. It seems to us that the parties to
the Palestine Question are losin sight of the im-
mense value to themselves that t is process repre-
sents. None of us can stand alone; disregard of
the Council’s view in one instance encoura es re-
calcitrance in another. The whole fabric 0 inter-
national cooperation inevitably suﬁ'ers. Thus, to
repeat, the question before us is one of compliance
with a. decismn of the United Nations. That deci-
sion was based on several important considera-
tions, one of which was that, and I quote, “neither
party can reasonably assert that it is actively a
belligerent or requires to exercise the right of
visit, search and seizure for any legitimate purpose
of self-defense.”
In our opinion, this principle is equally applica-
ble to the Suez Canal and to any waters outside
the Canal. This principle and the decision of
the Council in its resolution of 1951 should be ap-
plied by the parties themselves throu h the Mixed
Armistice Commission which the t iemselves set
up. Differences arising between t e parties under
the Armistice Agreement should always, in our
opinion, be handled as fully as possible in the ﬁrst
instance by the Mixed Armistice machine . An
exception to this rule could weaken the eli'iective-
ness of that machinery. We believe that the Mixed
Armistice Commission, in considering the speciﬁc
com laint with respect to actions in the Gulf of
Aqaba, must be bound not only by the provisions
of the General Armistice Agreement, but should
act also in the light of paragraph 5 of the resolu-
tion of September 1, 1951.
We therefore fully sup ort the draft resolution
presented to this Counci by New Zealand.‘ 1Ve
ope that the members of the Council will like-
wise ive it their full support in the knowledge
that t ere is involved here the all-important ques-
tion of peace and securit ' in the Near East. The
representative of E ypt {Mahmoud Azmi], in the
statement of his overnment’s viewpoint pre-
sented to us at our meeting on March 12, has re-
