Secretary Robert D. Murphy:
Text of Cambodlln Note
\VAsnINGToN, April 20, 1954
The Ambassador of Cambodia resents his
compliments to His Excellency the ecretary of
State and, by order of his Government, has the
honor to transmit to him the text of the following
proclamation of the Royal Cambodian Govern-
ment:
“The Royal Cambodian Government reports to
the world a base crime that has just been com-
mitted by the Viet Minh in the territory of the
Kingdom.
“These are the facts: On Monday, April 12,
1954, at 7 a. m., a regular train carrying passen-
gers and freight left Phnom-Penh for Battam-
bang. At 11 a. m., the train struck some remote-
control mines between the stations of Roméas and
Kreang Skear, 80 kilometers from Phnom-Penh.
The locomotive was blocked and 40 cars were
overturned. Immediately thereafter, about ﬁve
hundred regular Viet Minh soldiers appeared
from the woods bordering the track and, with
knives, riﬂes, grenades, submachine guns, and ma-
chine guns, threw themselves on the overturned,
immobilized train. A regular massacre, executed
with unusual barbarity, was perpetrated.
Wounded persons, trapped in the cars, cried out
for help. In reply, they were sprinkled with gaso-
line and burned alive, dying in unimaginable suf-
fering. Thirty cars were likewise sprinkled with
gasoline and burned. Passengers who attempted
to escape were pursued, caught, brought back to
the very scene of the carnage, and killed slowly
with axes and knives. The aged, children, women,
and even bonzes were, without exception, sub-
jected to this slaughter, stemming from the most
ignoble barbarity.
“None of the passengers had the fate of prison-
ers of war. More than a hundred passengers of
both sexes, including thirty bonzes and a Viet-
namese, perished thus, either in the ﬂames or by
slow death from axes and knives. There were no
members of the armed forces on the train. There
were no soldiers, policemen, or members of any
[other] active forces.
“The tragic incident occurred on the eve of the
Cambodian New Year. It is customary on that
occasion for the inhabitants, ordinary private in-
dividuals, ofﬁcials, or religious, to travel, often a
great distance, to 'oin their families, in order to
perform their traditional rites together.
“Consequently, in attacking a regular train
carrying ordinary passengers and goods, from
which all military personnel were excluded, the
Viet Minh cannot claim that it was a military ac-
tion in retaliation or reprisal against the Cambo-
dian national forces. In committing their ignoble
crime on the eve of the Cambodian New Year, the
Viet Minh intentionally ignored, to serve their
cause, the rights, as well as the practices and cus-
toms of a free, peace-loving people.
“In view of these facts, the Royal Government
of Cambodia appeals to the conscience of the
civilized world to judge whether the crime related
above is indeed proof that the Viet Minh are ﬁght-
ing for the ‘liberation’ and ‘independence’ of Cam-
bodia. Cambodia demands justice, that all the
acts of barbarity committed against it by the Viet
Minh be solemnly condemned.”
The Ambassador of Cambodia avails himself of
the occasion of the present note to renew to His
Excellency the Secretary of State the assurances
of his very high consideration.

WASHINGTON, May 1, 1954
The Acting Secretar of State presents his com-
pliments to His Exce lency the Ambassador of
Cambodia and has the honor to acknowledge re~
ceipt of his note of April 20, 1954, which contained
the text of a proclamation by the Royal Cambodian
Government describing a base crime which had
been committed by the Viet Minh in the territory
of the Kingdom of Cambodia.
This sanguinary atrocity, which occurred on
April 12 when the Viet Minh attacked a train in
Cambodia and murdered in cold blood and with-
out the slightest provocation more than one hun-
dred helpless and peaceful passengers, is shocking
to the American people. The Acting Secretary
would appreciate the Ambassador’s conveying to
the Foreign Minister his feeling of revulsion at
this senseless crime and his deep sympathy with
the bereaved families of the victims in their loss.
The Government of the United States has long
been aware of the moral depths to which the forces
of world Communism can descend. The frightful
massacre which has now taken place within the
boundaries of a peace-loving country is further
evidence, if any be needed, of Communist
depravity.
The Government of the United States solemnly
condemns the barbaric atrocity which has been
perpetrated against the peaceful Cambodian
people and expresses its sympathy to the families
of those who were so brutally murdered by the Viet
Minh.
