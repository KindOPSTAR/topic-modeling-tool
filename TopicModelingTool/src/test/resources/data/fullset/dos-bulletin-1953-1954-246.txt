war. I presented the dreadful story of Commu-
nist atrocities in Korea which so moved the Gen-
eral Assembly that it adopted a condemnatory
resolution. In addition to these speciﬁc topics,
we have adopted the ractice of always answer-
ing a Communist speaker immediately so that no
news story, goes out of the United Nations to the
world u lic consisting only of the Communist
side. n that news stor there is always some-
thing from the side of t e free world.
In November the President came to the con-
clusion that, if the legislature of Puerto Rico
adopted a resolution asking for complete inde-
pendence, he would be glad to do all in his power
to see that Puerto Rico got it. The President
chose the United Nations as the place at which
that announcement should be made. \Vhen it was
made, it created great good will for the United
States among Latin American countries and also
in countries in Asia and Africa where the colonial
question is a matter of active interest.
The third question asks whether it is true that
the United States has given an undue proportion
of manpower to the Korean war and that the other
pieilnbers of the United Nations have put in too
itt e.
There is no doubt that the contribution of the
United States to the war in Korea was of over-
riding importance and was in fact utterly in-
dispensable. In combat manpower alone the con-
tribution of the United States was far larger than
that of any one country except the Re ublic 0f
Korea—and it is the United States whic trained
and equi ped the Republic of Korea army.
It is a so true that the other United Nations
members put up the equivalent of two divisions.
The United States divisions at World \Var II
ﬁgures cost $600 million a year. The cost today
is probably greater, but is a secret. If, there-
fore, the United States had had to furnish these
two divisions, the added dollar cost would have
been at least $600 million. When you compare
that with our annual contribution of $25 million,
you can see that on a ﬁnancial basis alone the
United Nations is not a bad deal.
Carrying the ﬁscal argument still further, re-
member that the most expert studies indicate that
after every last bill has been paid, World War H
Wlll' have cost us $1 trillion, 300 billion—which
again makes our $25 million contribution to the
United Nations seem smaller.
Of course, money is not the only, and not even
the most important, consideration. If the United
States had had to supply two more divisions there
would have been that many more American casual-
ties, that many more tragedies in American homes,
which .were instead suffered in homes of other
countries whose brave men answered the call.
Many persons had the idea at the end of World
War II that the United Nations would be an auto-
matic peace producer—that a few gifted lawyers
scattered around the world would draft a charter;
that this charter would be ratiﬁed by the nationS'
that a handsome building would be erected; an
that then the world would have an automatic de-
vice for peace.
Ne Autemetle Devlee ter Peace
The truth is that there is no automatic device
for peace. If the United Nations is as automatic
as a burglar alarm it is doing well. But what
happens after the bell rings is up_to the mem-
bers, and you will get results solely in proportion
as you contribute. In_ the grim struggle for
peace, the payments which must be_made are not
merely in money; they are chieﬂy in the service
of men. In the face of something as critical as
an impending war nothing less than human
muscle, human hearts, and human sci-Vice Will do
the job.
Rather than draft a charter and then look .for
troops it might have been more 10 'cal at the time
for the nations to have earmarke the troops and
then drafted the charter. But history is not al-
ways logical and we do progress.
In the struggle for peace, as in every other hu-
man endeavor, the success of the struggle depends
directly on how hard you work, how deeply you
sacriﬁce, how sincerely you care, how muc i in the
service of your sons you are Willing to put in.
No amount of diplomatic nicety and verbal cour-
tesy can alter this fact, and the future of the
United Nations is bound up in it. _
The United Nations is a place where the nations
of the world may take whatever collective action
they are at any given moment capable of taking.
Such a place is a vital necessity. _ _
While the need for the United Nations is as
strong and as steady as the human yearning for
peace, its future success depends entirely on the
extent to which its members support it. It is up
to them. They can drop it impatiently and de-
stro it because it had not brought the millennium,
or t ey can kill it by failure to support it. Or,
like the Wright Brothers with their ﬁrst airplane
in 1903, they can perfect it and transform it into
something which will make future generations
forever grateful that we in the 1950’s had thepa-
tience and the foresight to make this beginning.
For Americans the United Nations is not _0nly
a place to promote peace, it is the greatest smgle
place in which to develop partners who, valuing
their own freedom, will ﬁght to defend it when-
ever it is attacked and thus, on a basis of mutual
respect, help us in our struggle to survive. For a
nation like the United States, which has most of
the world’s wealth and only 6 percent of the
world’s population, the conclusion must be obvious
that we cannot have too many partners to help us
carry the load of combat.
The United Nations is primitive; it is evolution-
