ment of seed includes cabbage, corn, and water-
melon, all important cash cro s and staple foods

Unusually heavy rains in March brought the
worst Tigris River ﬂood in the 47 years that ﬂood
levels have been recorded. It has been estimated
that some 3 million acres of land in the Tigris basin
were ﬂooded; 500,000 people were displaced or
made homeless and, although there was little loss
of human life, damage toll came to some $80
million.
U.S. Presents Argument
in U.N. Award Case
Press release 313 dated June 10
The Government of the United States was rep-
resented on June 10 before the International Court
of Justice at The Hague by Herman Phleger, Legal
Adviser of the Department of State, who pre-
sented the oral argument of the United States in
the advisory opinion proceedings regarding the
effect of awards of the Administrative Tribunal
of the United Nations.
In the present case the International Court of
Justice has been asked by the United Nations Gen-
eral Assembly to advise whether the Assembly has
the right, on any grounds, to refuse effect to awards
of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal.
It has also been asked, if the answer to the ﬁrst
question is afﬁrmative, on what principal grounds
it can lawfully exercise that right.
The awards in dispute are the compensation ad-
judged by the Tribunal as due to 11 United States
citizens who, in 1953, were dismissed from the
United Nations by the Secretary-General for re-
fusing to testify before oﬂicial U. S. investigat-
ing bodies regarding subversive activities. The
Tribunal held that the action of the Secretary-
General was not taken in accord with the staff reg-
ulations and was, therefore, illegal. Last fall, the
Eighth General Assembly, instead of appropriat-
ing funds to pay the awards, sought the advisory
opinion of the International Court of Justice.
Under the Statute of the International Court of
Justice, governments interested in an advisory
opinion proceeding are afforded an opportunity
to submit written statements to the Court and are
allowed oral hearings. In the present proceeding,
14 governments, including the United States, pre-
sented written statements setting forth the views
of their governments, while four other govern-
ments sent communications referring to expres-
sions they had previously made in General
Assembly debate.
Mr. Phle er, in his oral argument to the Court,
has summe up the United States position as fol-
lows:
In the view of the United States Government, the argu-
ment that the Assembly has no right to review the awards,
and must automatically pay them, cannot be sustained.
We think the Assembly has not only the right, but the
duty as well, to examine requests for appropriations, and
has the right to refuse appropriations to pay awards of
the Administrative Tribunal in those cases where it be-
lieves that the relevant considerations so require. We
think the grounds to support such action are found in the
Charter provisions deﬁning the budgetary and regulatory
responsibilities of the Assembly, its relationship to sub-
sidiary organs such as the Administrative Tribunal, the
function of the Secretary-General as the chief administra-
tive ofﬁcer of the Organization, and in the Charter pro-
visions regarding interpretation and judicial power.
Whether the General Assembly would decide. in a given
case, to refuse an appropriation must depend on its
judgment of many factors which are proper for the As-
sembly’s consideration. The weighing of these factors
adds up to a Judgment of a legislative character, to be
made by the highest United Nations body in which all
Members are represented. The Charter basis and limi-
tations of Assembly action can and should be stated, as
a matter of law. The reasons and motivations of As-
sembly decision to vote or refuse an appropriation in a
particular situation are otherwise to be left to the Judg-
ment of the Assembly, as the United Nations organ with
immediate responsibility in the matter.
