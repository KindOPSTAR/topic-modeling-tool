The Middle East and South Asia—the Problem of Security
by John D. Jemegan
Deputy Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern, South Asian and African Affairs 1
The General subject of the Middle East is an
extremely broad one. If I were to attem t to cover
all as ects of American relations with t at area it
woul take more time than is available and would
probably be beyond my capacity. It seemed to me
therefore, that it would be best to conﬁne myself
to one aspect which has been very much in the news
in recent weeks, that is, the problem of develo in
a security s stem for the area, the be inning w ic
ma have been made toward a so utlon of this
pro lem through the decision of Turkey and Paki-
stan to institute closer relations between them-
selves,2 and the decision of the American Govern-
ment to accede to Pakistan’s request for military
assistance.
For at least 2 centuries, since the decline of the
Ottoman Empire began, there has been little or
no indigenous defensive strength in the Middle
East and South Asia. In consequence, that area
has been the object of great power rivalries. One
of the outstanding elements in the picture was the
recurrent drive of imperial Russm to the south
and east. This drive met with little resistance
from the Middle Eastern states themselves and
was held in check only by the counterweight of
other European powers, especially Britain and
France. During the 19th century, Britain estab-
lished a ﬁrm base in the Indian subcontinent and
another base in the Near East. As a result, the
area from the Eastern Mediterranean to the Pa-
ciﬁc enjoyed a sort of Paw Britannica. Whatever
judgment may be passed on British rule and
British inﬂuence from the point of view of the
inhabitants of the area itself, this provided a de-
gree of stability and prevented an overturn of the
world balance of forces.
After World War II the basis of British power
in the Middle East and South Asia was reduced.
Britain withdrew from the Indian subcontinent,
from Burma, from Ceylon, and from Palestine.
She also felt obliged to relin uish her direct re-
s onsibilit for support of reece and Turkey.
his left t e states concerned free to pursue their
own nationalist aspirations in their own way, but
it also left them largely defenseless against a
predatory eat power, and unfortunately Soviet
ambitions in that direction did not end with the
overthrow of the Czarist regime.
It is si iﬁcant to note that the secret Nazi Ger-
many-U. .S.R. draft agreement of November 26,
1940, contains the following passage: “The Soviet
Union declares that its territorial aspirations
center south of the national territory of the Soviet
Union in the direction of the Indian Ocean.”'
Since 1940 we have had abundant evidence that
the Soviets still feel the same way. An outstand-
ing example was their attempt to take over con-
trol of Iranian Azerbaijan in 1945 and 1946.
Vlslblllty of Kremlln's Hand
We have no evidence to show that since Stalin’s
death Soviet objectives have changed. Moscow-
directed attempts at subversion continue. I do
not believe there is a single country in the Middle
East where the hand of the Kremlin does not show.
In some, such as Turkey, strong governmental ac-
tion has made these efforts extremely difﬁcult. In
others, however, the machinations of the local
Communists contribute greatly to internal
instabilit .
Thus, t e security of the Middle East and South
Asia has necessarily become a source of dee con-
cern to the free world. While the United tates
was willing and able to assume the responsibility
of strengthening Greece and Turkey and was able
to carry it out with success, it has not been pos-
sible to apply the same technique to the security
problems of the far greater area lying to the
south and east of Turkey. Many of the countries
