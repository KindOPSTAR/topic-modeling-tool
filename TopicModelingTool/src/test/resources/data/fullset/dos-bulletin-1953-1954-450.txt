Western Unity—Cornerstone of Free World Defense
by Deputy Under Secretary Murphy 1
Joseph Stalin died a little over a year ago,
March 5 to be exact.
His death set the world to dreaming. Even
the most pessimistic felt a little hopeful. And
why not? To a reasonable man Soviet ideas on
world domination seem, and are, preposterous.
Moscow should have every reason to try and get
along with the rest of the world. And Malenkov
seemed to talk more sensibly than his predecessor.
The situation held out hopes that many in Eu-
rope especiall were eager to reach for. Of course,
the Soviets id nothing but it was possible to
believe that they were only waiting for the right
moment to launch a conciliatory move.
The Berlin conference shattered these modest
hopes. It gave the free world a ﬁrsthand post-
Stalin picture of Soviet intentions. The picture
was unchanged. The leopard, Mr. Molotov made
clear, has not changed its spots. No matter how
dulcet a tune it sings, its appetite is still ravenous.
We now have reason to believe that return to group
control, instead of one man rule in the Kremlin,
has not changed the constant basic policy line and
that the U.S.S.R. does not intend to yield a foot
of territory.
Molotov was remarkably open in his efforts to
use the Conference to divide the Western World.
First and last throughout the Conference, he
probed to ﬁnd weak spots in our unity. He made
a steady and persistent effort to capitalize on pos-
sible differences. The U.S., of course, was his
principal target. It was a rather backhanded
compliment that he made no attempt to appease
us. \Ve were the enemy. He tried to draw both
France and the UK. into a European bloc that
excluded the United States.
He failed. Both France and Great Britain
stood ﬁrm. If anything, the Conference closed
with the Western Powers more ﬁrmly united.
The Conference ended, as Secretary Dulles has
reported, with a greater degree of unity among the

three Western Powers than had existed when the
Conference began.
This is of capital im ortance. The unity of
the Atlantic community as been, and remains, a
cornerstone of the free world’s struggle to defend
its freedom.
Why? Well look at your map. Look across
the Atlantic. Here are the nations and the peo-
ples from which we, most Americans, sprang. In
lood and culture our ties are strong. We share
the same views on human liberties.
Perha s this is the reason why we, sometimes,
do not a ways et along. We quarrel as do mem-
bers of a fami y. We are more critical of each
other than we would be of strangers. We expect
more of each other.
We can aﬁord to disa because our basic
loyalties are the same. 11 the face of common
dan ers in the past we have found these basic
loya ties stronger than our passing differences.
Today we are doing the same.
This, however, is not the real issue. It is not
the explanation of the importance the Soviets
place upon dividing Europe and the United States.
It is a question of power—of technical skills,
industrial capacity, and resources.
The world’s second greatest pool of skilled man-
power is in Europe.
Sovlot Manpower Shortage
A great weakness of the Soviets lies in their lack
of skilled manpower. Years of training lie be-
tween them and the day when they can match the
Atlantic community, man for man, in the techni-
cians demanded by an industrial economy. That
is why the citadel of the Ruhr is a magnet for
them. Even though Lenin has said the road to
Paris is via Peking, Molotov put it—as goes Ger-
many so goes Europe.
Production in the Soviet area has increased but
it hasn’t increased rapidly enough to suit them.

ministration (June 30, 1953) illustrates this point
