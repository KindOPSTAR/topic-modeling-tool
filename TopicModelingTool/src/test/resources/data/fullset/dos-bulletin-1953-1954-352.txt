drilling 300 tube wells in the state of Pepsu, 255 in
Punjab, and 200 in Uttar Pradesh, as part of the
2,000 wells involved in the Indo-American Pro-
gram. The tube well program, for which $13,-
700.000 of United States funds and the Indian
equivalent of $9,300,000, was designed to achieve
an increase in India’s food production and to help
overcome its food deﬁcit.”
On December 28 the Foreign Operations Ad-
ministration announced another agreement with
India calling for expenditures of $20 million and
the Indian equivalent of $6,730,000 for the pur-
chase of 100 new locomotives and 5,000 new freight
cars, in the interest of improving India’s railroad
system. On January 20, 1954, the FOA announced
that, under an Indo-American roject, India’s
farm-equipment manufacturers, railways, and con-
struction industry would be the principal con-
sumers of 200,000 tons of steel being provided
during 1954. The agreement provided for $25,-
500,000 in U.S. funds to ﬁnance purchase of steel
from free-world markets outside India.“
The United States and Pakistan, as a supple-
ment to the agreement of February 2, 1952, signed
an agreement on April 1, 1953, providing for an
American allotment of some $12,254,000, with an
equivalent from Pakistan. At the same time proj-
ects were approved for the utilization of $8,437,-
500 of these funds for ( 1) the continuation of the
Village Agricultural and Industrial Develo ment
Program, (2) importation of fertilizer, (3 con-
struction of a water development laboratory at
Karachi, (4) construction of a fertilizer factory at
Karachi, (5) construction of an irrigation and
reclamation dam across the Bolan River at Sibi
(Baluchistan), and (6) assistance in the develop-
ment of modern ﬁshing facilities at Karachi.“
In view of the serious wheat problem, a number
of steps were taken to assist Pakistan, includin
the sending of Dean Ha _ Reed of the College 0%
Agriculture at Purdue lIlziiversity to survey the
situation. Following an intensive study, Dean
Reed reported late in May 1953 that the most
urgent problem was that of assuring food during
the next year." To help meet this critical situa-
tion, President Eisenhower advised Congress on
J une 10, 1953, that the people of Pakistan were
faced with famine and urged that 1,000,000 tons
of wheat be sent on an emergency basis, out of
stocks held by the Commodity Credit Corporation.
Congress acted with dispatch and the legislation
was signed on June 25, 1953. The ﬁrst wheat ship-
ments reached Karachi less than a month later, and
by November 25 some 350 tons had reached
Pakistan.as
A frz'oa—Both Liberia and Ethiopia have re-
ceived important technical cooperation assistance
from the United States; the Liberian program
dates back to the war years. Under the general
agreement of 1950 a Joint Liberian—United States
Commission for Economic Development was estab-
lished, to which the Liberian Government assigns
approximate] 20 ercent of its total annual reve-
nue. Airﬁeld’ an harbor construction have been
carried out and economic and health missions have
assisted the country. 8°
On May 22, 1953, an agreement was signed with
Ethiopia whereby the United States was to pro-
vide equipment and trainin for the Ethiopian
armed forces, composed 0 some 20,000 men.
Moreover, by 1953, the United States had con-
tributed some $2,000,000 in technical and economic
assistance to Ethiopia, the local contribution being
some $500,000, with the American staﬂ’ totaling
some 67 people. Primarily technical assistance
in agriculture has been involved, one agricultural
secondary school havin been opened and another
planned. The Ethiopian Government plans to
spend $5,000,000 on an agricultural and mechani-
cal college.
Export-Import Bank Loans
Even before the inauguration of the programs
for technical and economic assistance, the Export-
Import Bank of Washington had authorized a
number of loans in the Near East, South Asia,
and Africa for the economic development of coun-
tries in that general area. By July 1953, these
loans were substantially as shown in the table on
