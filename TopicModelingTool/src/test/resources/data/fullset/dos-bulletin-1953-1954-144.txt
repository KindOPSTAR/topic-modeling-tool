Our Vlotory In Korea
by Walter S. Robertson
Assistant Secretary for Far Eastern Affairs ‘
Pride in all its forms, as we know, is very re re-
hensible. And local pride—pride in one’s p ace
of origin—being particularly vainglorious, is par-
ticularly sinful. However, I have no repentance
in confessing to this sin. I am intensely proud of
Virginia. And furthermore, I should say I do not
believe the Almi hty ever intended Vir 'nians to
be modest about ir inia. If He had, e would
not have made it so iﬁicult for us.
It is impossible not to be proud of Virginia’s
contribution to our civilization. There have been
so many great Virginians that they have tended to
stand in one another’s shadow, like trees that have
grown to giant stature, one close beside another, in
soil of exceptional richness. Had Jefferson, for
example, been a native of one of the States north
of the Potomac, he would today, I believe, have a
national cult at least as imprewive as Lincoln’s.
If Jeﬁerson has never full received the under-
standing and appreciation t at are his due, it may
be in part because he had on either side of him the
towering ﬁgures of Washington and of Lee. It
was the fate of those two incomparable leaders, as
it was their capacity, to embody and symbolize in
their own rsons t e great causes for which they
fought. e have the feeling about them that, even
while they lived they were immortals and were
not to be comprehended in terms common to ordi-
nary human beings. It is apparent that even their
contemporaries felt this.
J eﬂ'erson, though no less great than George
Washington and Robert E. Lee in terms of his
achievements, was by contrast an intensely human
ﬁgure. His attainments——and they were extraordi-
nary, almost unbelievable in their range—were the
attainments of a man who realized within himself,
perhaps as fully as any one person since Leonardo

that that will notbetried. If the Soviet leaders
come to Berlin with a genuine desire to create
conditions of peace, they will ﬁnd us openminded
and cooperative and we can to ether do much good
for German and Austria an indeed for Europe
and the wor d.
da Vinci, the potentialities of human beings. Per-
haps more truly than an other American, before
or since, Jefferson visua ized the si iﬁcance and
promise of our country. His vision is always new,
always meaningful. And it is to his vision that
our country, as long as it is true to itself, must
always be strivin to live up.
In all that Je erson did as a statesman, you
feel his consciousness that the eyes of the world
were upon the young American Republic. He
was intensely aware, throughout those years of
struggle, of the importance to the human race of
what he and his contemporaries were trying to
achieve. It was a constantly recurring theme of
his writing. As he expressed it on one occasion:
“No experiment can be more interestin than
that we are now t ing, which we trust Will end
in establishin the act that man may be governed
by reason an truth.”
Although the subject I have chosen to talk
about this evenin is Korea, it is to that int—
the point that Je erson made—that I sha 1 come
back in the end. What the American peo le did
was signiﬁcant for mankind in Jeﬂ'erson’s ay be-
cause democracy was in the experimental stage.
It is signiﬁcant today because democracy is facing
a challenge more determined than perhaps any it
has had to meet in the past.
Results 0! the Korean War
The American people, I am aware, have a gnaw-
ing feeling of dissatisfaction and frustration over
the results of the Korean war. The attitude of
many is that because we did not drive the Chinese
Communists back into Manchuria and fully liber—
ate Korea we failed in our undertaking. The
point is made that North Korea is still in the
grip of a foreign, Communist tyranny, that this
