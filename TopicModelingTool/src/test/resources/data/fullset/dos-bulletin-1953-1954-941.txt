of the collisions, the disturbances, which produce
social unrest and wars. Then, it is said, there will
be eace and maximum productivity, because we
shall have ap lied to man the same principles of
conduct whic , we ﬁnd, increase peace and pro-
ductivity in the case of domesticated animals.
Under our system political liberty and national
sovereignty are orderly and acceptable only if we
exercise self-restraints and self-control in accord-
ance with the dictates of moral law; it is indis-
pensable to a free society that there be acceptance
of the supremacy of moral law, or free society
becomes a society of intolerable license. Basically
the present conﬂict between freedom and despot-
ism 1s a conﬂict between a spiritual and material
view of the universe and of the nature of man.
It is not and cannot be satisfactory to the Soviet
Communists that freedom is suppressed only with-
in what is now the area dominated by them—this
for the reason that freedom an where is a constant
danger to them because free om is inherently a
contagious and dynamic moral force.
Thus it happens in our negotiations with the
Communists, whether it be in relation to Germany,
Austria, atomic ener , or Korea or Indochina,
there is always a con51stent pattern. The cannot
relax their grip on what the have. hey in-
variably inSIst upon a form a which will not
only assure the per etuation of their despotism
but they seek by rutiiless methods to gain control
of other and more distant areas which still enjoy
freedom.
That is the grim element, in what would other-
wise be a favorable, even happy, international ic-
ture, and it overshadows the future destiny 0 to-
day’s graduating class and the classes of all our
American universities. Arising out of these cir-
cumstances and to protect the youn eople in
the development of their careers an t e enjoy-
ment of a way of life which we cherish, your
government is engaged in the elaboration of a
system of collective security.
Naturally the most important objective of our
government is to keep the peace and the car inal
principle it has adopted for this urpose is the
rinciple of collective security. e learned this
lbsson from the bitter experiences of two world
wars. We have tried and it continues to be a tenet
of American policy to apply this principle on a
universal basis in the United Nations.
Unfortunately for the world, Soviet imperial-
ism, operating under various slogans and promot-
ing the cause of international communism, became
the chief disturber of the peace throughout a whole
series of expansionist projects. By devious ways
and the ample use of the veto its representatives
have tried to obstruct the normal 0 eration of the
[Tnited Nations peace machinery w ich under the
charter is comparatively simple and clear. A
number of nations including our own refused to
be frustrated by Soviet obstructionist tactics and
it fortunately became apparent that the peace-
making function of the United Nations is so im-
portant that it oﬂ'ers a reasonable latitude and a
variety of action all within the purview of the
Charter.
Thus it is well to remember that the Uniting for
Peace Resolution empowered the vetoless General
Assembly to initiate collective action against ag-
gression. Article 52 of the charter authorizes and
encourages regional securit arrangements for
keeping the eace. And, 0 course, the historic
Vandenberg esolution adopted by our Congress
authorized American association with regional
and other collective security arrangements.
So it is clear that the guideline for United States
security action contemplates that such action have
the moral sanction of the United Nations in ac-
cordance with its established procedures. In such
instances it is also clear that our national action
must be a part of collective action, either under
the charter as in the case of Korea, or under
regional arrangements for self-defense as author-
ized by the charter and of course including the
threatened victim nation itself. In the words of
our President, each area must be defended pri-
marily by the people of that region; no nation can
be saved which does not wish to be saved.
Thus our present policy represents an evolution
of the security goals we set for ourselves during
the course of American postwar planning. It has
been adapted to cope with Communist obstruction
but it still stresses security as the primary require-
ment for world progress.
Closely associated in our minds with security
is the promotion of world prosperity through co-
operation. Again the Iron Curtain has denied us
this on a worldwide basis but the free world offers
us a vast area in which we can act. And your
Government is acting with vigor in the ﬁelds of
economic cooperation and technical assistance as
well as in the broader areas of cultural exchanges
and intellectual cooperation. It is in these areas
that solid barriers can be erected against Com-
munist subversion which breeds on and inspires
social distress, and so strength can be stored
against eventual Communist aggression.
