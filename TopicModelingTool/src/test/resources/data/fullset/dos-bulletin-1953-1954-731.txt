The rate earned by government securities always
marks the lowest level in every healthy economy.
The rate necessary to attract domestic invest-
ment capital in Latin America, an area where in-
dustrialization is in an earlier stage than here, is
approximately that which prevailed in this coun-
try in the same period of our own industrial de-
velopment. It is hi her than that prevailing in
this country today. ventually it should be about
the same.
Especially in industries whose rate of return is
ﬁxed by government, the Latin American coun-
tries must, if they would brin out their own do-
mestic private capital, aﬂ'or assurances of an
opportunity to earn a rate of return which is rea~
sonable when judged by standards revailing in
their own economies and not by standards revail-
ing in the United States. Any policy of a lowing
a rate of return no hi her than those prevailing
in the United States e ectively destroys the pos-
sibility of attracting investment capital from
sources within the country. A policy which dis-
courages the entry of purely domestic capital into
government-regulated utilities dela s and ob-
structs the formation of a strong, sel -supporting
national economy.
Freer and Expanding Trade—
Reductlon of Trade Barriers
Of the factors which together explain the degree
of prosperity and economic strength that exists
here, not the least is that the United States is one
of the largest free trade areas in the world.
Every industry logically locates its operations
at that point within the trade area accessible to
it where local factors offer the greatest assurances
of producing a good product at competitive prices.
The greater the area accessible to the industry, the
greater the probabilities of encountering a loca-
tion affording maximum access to raw materials,
labor supply, ower, means of transportation, a
market, etc. great industry has never grown
up in the absence of a great market.
This administration is fully aware of the im-
practicability of any move by the American Re-
publics to establish free trade throughout the
Americas. It is convinced, however, that a policy
of reciprocal adjustment of trade barriers aﬂ’ords
maximum assurance of economic strength and sta-
bility not only to our own people but to the peo-
ples of the other American nations and to all
nations.
As President Eisenhower said in his message to
Congress of March 30:
. . we and other free nations are still severely limited
by the persistence of uneconomic, manmade barriers to
mutual trade and the ﬂow of funds among us.
Together we and our friends abroad must work at the
task of lowering the unjustiﬁable barriers—not all at
once but gradually and with full regard for our own
interests. In this effort, the United States must take the
initiative and. in doing so, make clear to the rest of the
world that we expect them to follow our lead.
There is natural opposition both at home and
abroad from those elements whose personal busi-
ness interests would be prejudiced by such a
program.
There are also sincere but (we feel) misguided
thinkers in the other American nations who argue
for retention of high Latin American tariff bar-
riers but for a reduction of our own. They argue
that the development of their own extractive and
manufacturing industries is dependent upon ac-
cess to the great market of the United States and
that we should therefore reduce our tariﬁ's. If
we would see their roducing industries grow
strong we must afford) them this access by reduc-
ing our tariﬂ’ barriers. In this argument they
are entirely sound.
Yet when it comes to their own tariﬁ' barriers,
these same men with great sincerity argue that
their local industries cannot com ete with those
of the United States and should t erefore be pro-
tected by high tariff barriers of whose existence
we must not complain.
We cannot share that view. We believe that
the reatest beneﬁt for the greatest number of
peopi in all countries lies in a reasonable, or-
der] , and reci rocal reduction of trade barriers.
The geograp ical location of an industry is con-
trolled by a combination of factors such as
proximity to raw material, to sources of labor,
to power of a type usable in the industry, to means
of transportation, and to the market. Obviously,
given the many instances in Latin America where
all of these factors are favorably related to each
other, many industries would be established
throughout Latin America if they but had as-
surance of access to a broader market for the prod-
ucts of their plants. Such industries could make
a real contribution not only to the economies of
the countries in which they were situated but to
the economies of other countries of the world.
Such industries could be established and grow in
Latin America, as elsewhere, under a worldwide
policy of orderly and reciprocal reductions in
trade barriers.
Need for Flrm Currencies
One of the basic features of a strong economy
is a ﬁrm local currency whose domestic purchasing
ower does not ﬂuctuate widely or unpredictabl .
EVhere it exists, prices will remain relative y
stable. There is conﬁdence in the promises of the
overnment to meet its ﬁnancial obligations.
Eiovernment bonds maintain their purchasing
ower. Funds needed for investment will stay at
ome rather than seek safety abroad. There is
investment in business and in securities issued to
generate capital for industry rather than in real
estate.
