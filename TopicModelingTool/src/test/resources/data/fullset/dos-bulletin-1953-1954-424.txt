of that region have not felt it in their national
interest to request American assistance. In
others, a grant of American military assistance
on the scale of that provided to Greece and Turkey
would be beyond the capacity of the countries
concerned to assimilate and utilize. Further-
more, I need hardly say that American resources
are not unlimited. Nevertheless, the danger of
aggression exists in the Middle East no less than
in the Far East and in Europe. The nations of
the free world could not ignore it and have not
i ored it. The have cons1dered it essential that
t e area be enabled to develop peacefully, free
from the danger of being swallowed by Soviet
communism.
You undoubtedly recall that there were dis-
cussions in 1951 about the establishment of :1 Mid-
dle East Command to be sponsored by the United
States, the United Kingdom, France Turkey, and
certain British dominions and to include the Arab
States.‘ This ro osal met with little enthusiasm
on the part of t e ear Eastern states, which were
too preoccupied with their disputes with the West
and the hostility between the Arabs and Israel to
wish to engage in a general defensive arrange-
ment under Western leadership.
In 1952 consideration was iven to the ssible
formation of what was called a Middle ast De-
fense Organization, which was to have been a
much looser rouping designed rimaril for co-
operative de ense plannin .‘ T is, again, failed
to attract the interest of t e Near Eastern states
whose participation would have been essential for
its success.
When Secretary of States Dulles took ofﬁce last
year he decided to have a new look at the whole
problem of the Near East and South Asia, includ-
ing the security situation. In the spring of 1953
he made an extensive tour of the area. He
traveled many thousands of miles and spoke at
length with leaders of government. When he re-
turned, he had this to say about the problem of
defense:‘
A Middle East Defense Organization is a future rather
than an immediate possibility. Many of the Arab League
countries are so engrossed with their quarrels with Israel
or with Great Britain or France that they pay little heed
to the menace of Soviet communism. However, there is
more concern where the Soviet Union is near. in gen-
eral, the northern tier of nations shows awareness of the
danger.
There is a vague desire to have a collective security sys
tem. But no such system can be imposed from without.
It should be designed and grow from within out of a
sense of common destiny and common danger.
While awaiting the formal creation of a security asso-
ciation, the United States can usefully help strengthen
the interrelated defense of those countries which want
strength, not as against each other or the West, but to
resist the common threat to all free peoples.
‘For a summary of the discussions, see Buuzmv of
Nov. 26, 1951. p. 842 and Dec. 15, 1952. p. 937.
‘ For a statement regarding U.S. efforts, see ibid., Dec.
15. 1952, p. 938.
'Ibid., June 15, 1953, p. 835.
I believe the key to the future of collective secur-
ity in the Middle East lies in what Secretary
Dulles said about its havin to spring from within
—-that it cannot be force on the area from the
outside. Both the idea of the Middle East Com-
mand and that of the Middle East Defense Or-
anization foundered because they relied on
initiative being supplied from the West.
Divergence 0t View: Regarding Danger
There is still no unanimity among the states of
the Middle East and South Asia regardin the
best means of preserving their freedom. here
is not even agreement among them, in all cases,
as to the nature or imminence of the threat to
their security. Some of them, conditioned by past
experience or inﬂuenced by immediate problems,
sti 1 seem to believe that they are as much en-
dangered by an “imperialist threat” from the west
as by eril from the north. Others have come to
feel, right] in our opinion, that the overriding
danger is t at of Communist expansionism. This
is the conclusion which has been reached by the
Government of Pakistan. As a matter of fact,
hi h ofﬁcials of the Government of Pakistan, in
informal conversations, had indicated to us months
ago their interest in stren hening Pakistan and
had made clear that Pa istan recognized the
dangers the free world faced. For our part, we
had been considering the potential possemed by
Pakistan in connection with the problem of in-
creasin the defensive strength of the Middle
East. TV'hile this question was still under study
within the American Government, the Govern-
ments of Turkey and Pakistan began to consider
the advantages of closer cooperation between
themselves in the olitical, economic, cultural, and
security ﬁelds. he United States Government
was aware of this line of thinking, which it we]-
comed and which resulted in a Joint announce-
ment by the Governments of Turkey and Pakistan
on February 19 of this year that they intended “to
study methods of achieving closer friendly col-
laboration in the political, economic, and cultural
spheres as well as of strengthening peace and
security in their own interest as also in that of all
peace-loving nations.”
Meanwhile, the American Government had been
pondering the pros and cons of extending grant
military aid to akistan. There were obvious ad-
vantages. The Government of Pakistan had
shown its awareness of the danger, and in the state
of the world today it did not seem 00d policy to
rebuﬁ' those who think as we do ancigwho can con-
tribute to the security of the free world on which
our own security depends. Pakistan has concrete
assets to offer to the free world. She has a ﬁne
army which provided a large share of distin-
guished regiments to the Indian Army before par-
tition—regiments noted for bravery in two world
wars. She has ample manpower to eXpand that
