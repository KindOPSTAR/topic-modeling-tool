with statistics on coal and steel, the sinews of any
industrial economy.
Steel production in the United States and its
European allies has a lead of more than three to
one over that of the Soviet bloc, including Com-
munist China which produces little. In coal the
ed is two to one.
he Soviets, to be sure, devote a major part of
production to their military programs. But that,
too, is a weakness. It is a weakness recognized by
Malenkov in his recent promises of increased con-
sumer goods, promises upon which he must make
500d i he is to still mounting unrest. If he
oesn’t—well, that resents him with another
problem. Even tota itarian regimes must make
some concessions to the people. Communism has
promised a “workers’ paradise.” That paradise
is long overdue.
The Soviets see part of the answer in Free
Euro as skilled manpower and industrial lant.
To a d these to their own strength is their un-
changing objective.
The raw material resources of Free Europe are
another attraction. The Soviets, to be sure, have
resources of their own. Russia today is practi-
cally self-contained in the raw materials of in-
dustry. Her deﬁciencies of World \Var II have
been made up largely from satellite countries.
Lead and zinc now ﬂow into Russian lants from
Poland, East Germany, and the Ba kans. The
Balkans sup 1y chrome, molybdenum, and anti-
mony. Czechoslovakia and East Germany can be
de nded upon for some uranium. Finland ships
nicilreel. Manchuria and China provide tungsten,
antimon tin. lead, zinc, graphite, and cop r.
The inS.S.R., itself, is rich in a number 0 min-
erals. The are, however, undeveloped. Devel-
opment wil take time, and time, again, is some-
thing the Communists leaders use sparingly.
The resources of the free world, however, are
developed. They, too, are ﬁnding undeveloped
deposits but they have the means wherewith to
develop them—and quickly.
This country, for example, needs manganese.
We have very little of our own. In the ast we
supplied our needs from Russia. When t at ave-
nue was closed to us, we turned to other countries
of the free world in Asia, Africa, and South
America where there are vast deposits of man-
ganese.
Free World's Raw Materlels
The resources of the free world are ample to
meet its needs. But it is our combined resources.
No one country alone has everything it needs.
Of a list of 32 materials essential to industrial
production, the United States is deﬁcient perhaps
in 18. We have a surplus in only nine. The
British Commonwealth, however, had a surplus in
24, and of these 13 appear on our list of 18 deﬁcien-
cies. Conversely, several of the Commonwealth’s
deﬁciencies, seven in all, were on our list of sur-
pluses. Our needs and lacks balance each to-
gether. Together we have what we want.
As one of our authorities has so aptly said:
If each [the Unlted States and the British Common-
wealth] desires to maintain its political security and
peacetime industrial development, it follows that they
must ever be closely associated in foreign policy, inter-
national trade and naval strength to protect sea lanes.
These are facts with which we, you and I, have
to deal.
The British, I might add, are devoting $1 billion
in the coming year to maintain and strengthen
their Navy. T e British do not like taxes any
more than do ou or I. They growl as much as
we do. But t ey are aying them because they
know they dare do no ess in face of the danger
that threatens.
I have spoken of European skilled manpower
and resources. There is another angle to coopera-
tion upon which I would like to touch.
No Monopoly on Brainpower
We Americans do not have a monopoly on
brainpower. And in the crisis with which we are
confronted we need the brains as well as the skills
of our brothers across the Atlantic.
It ma come as a shock to some of us when we
are reminded that the United States did not, sin-
glehanded, produce the A-bomb. The truth is,
1t was the result of a combination of the brains
of many men from many nations.
Einstein, in whose brain the project was born,
is German by birth and education although now
American by adoption. There was Fermi, an
Italian; Chadwick, an Englishman; Bohr, a Dane;
Szilard, a Hungarian; and scores of others. Alex-
ander Sachs, another naturalized American, ﬁrst
took the idea to Washington at the r nest of
three exiled foreign scientists, Einstein, zilard,
and Wi her.
The nited States provided the engineering
skill, as well as scientiﬁc ability, that put the
idea into operation. From ﬁrst to last, however,
it was a cooperative venture.
Naturally, I am proud of m country’s role in
that project. And I am no less proud of the
fact because we did not do it alone.
President Eisenhower has proposed that the
nations of the world, all of them, make a co-
operative effort to ut this marvel of our a to
work for the bene t of the human race. am
happy to think that suggestion came from an
American, and no less hap y because many people
in many lands would benefit thereby.
Let us face the facts. The unity of the Atlantic
community is far more than just a matter of sen-
timent. It is today a question of survival. In our
unity lies our strength. And in that strength lies
all mankind’s best hope for the future.
The unity the \Vestern Powers displayed in
Berlin came about by careful planning. Mr.
