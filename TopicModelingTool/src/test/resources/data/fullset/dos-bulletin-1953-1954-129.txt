There is further transmitted for the informa-
tion of the Senate the report made to me by the
Secretar of State regarding the aforesaid treaty.
The utual Defense Treaty signed by the
United States and the Republic of Korea is de-
signed to deter aggression by giving evidence of
our common determination to meet the common
danger. It thus reaﬁirms our belief that the se-
curity of an individual nation in the free world
depends upon the security of its partners, and
constitutes another link in the collective security
of the free nations of the Paciﬁc.
I recommend that the Senate give early favor-
able consideration to the treaty submitted here-
with, and advise and consent to its ratiﬁcation.

REPORT BY SECRETARY DULLES ‘
DEPARTMENT or STATE,
Washington, December 30, 1.953.
The PRESIDENT,
The W hite H ouse .'
I have the honor to submit to you, with a view
to the transmission thereof to the Senate for its
advice and consent to ratiﬁcation, the Mutual De-
fense Treaty between the United States of
America and the Republic of Korea, signed at
Washington on October 1, 1953.
The provisions of the treat were negotiated
with the Republic of Korea y me during the
course of a visit to Korea last August to discuss
problems of mutual concern with President Syng-
man Rhee. Senate leaders were consulted and
kept fully informed of the exchange of views
which led to the development and formulation of
this treaty.
As I stated at the signing of the treaty, it is a
defense treaty ﬁrmly dedicated to peace. It is
designed to deter aggression by making clear that
each I_party recognizes that an armed attack in the
Paci c area 11 on the territory administratively
controlled by either would be dan rous to its own
peace and safety, and declares t iat it would act
to meet the common danger in accordance with
its constitutional processes. The undertaking of
each party to aid the other operates only in case
that party is the victim of external armed attack.
Armed attack by a party, either against a foreign
state, or against territory not at the time recog-
nized by the other as lawfully brought under the
administrative control of the ﬁrst, does not bring
the treaty into operation. An armed attack by
either party does not obligate the other to come to
its assistance.
As another step in the development of a Paciﬁc
security system, the treaty will complement the
earlier treaties which have entered into force with
' S. Exec. A, 83d Cong., 2d sess., p. 2.
Australia and New Zealand, the Philippines, and
Japan. Like those treaties, the treaty with Korea
is in full conformity with the objectives and prin-
ci les of the Charter of the United Nations. It
a rms the belief of this Government that the se-
curity of an individual nation in the free world
depends upon the security of its partners and con-
stitutes another link in the collective security of
the free nations of the Paciﬁc.
The treaty consists of a preamble and six sub-
stantive articles. The preamble sets forth the cir-
cumstances for making the treaty, providing in
particular that the treaty is designed to coordinate
the efforts of the parties “pending the develop-
ment of a more comprehenswe and effective sys-
tem of regional security in the Paciﬁc area.”
Thus evolutionary developments are contemplated
as in the treaties with Australia and New Zealand,
the Philippines, and Japan.
Article I is identical with the comparable ar-
ticles in the tripartite and Phili pine treaties,
except for the inclusion of an ad it-ional phrase
whereby the parties agree to refrain in their inter-
national relations from the threat or use of force
in any manner inconsistent not only with respect
to the purposes of the United Nations, but also
with respect to the obligations assumed by any
party toward the United Nations.
Article II calls for consultation between the
arties whenever the territorial integrity, polit-
ical independence, or the security of either party
is threatened by external armed attack. The
article also embodies the rinciple established by
Senate Resolution 239, 80th Congress, the Vanden-
berg resolution,6 which calls for “self-help and
mutual aid” by all the parties to security arrange-
ments joined in by the United States and which
involve commitments by the United States. The
provisions of the article are similar to compa-
rable provisions in the treaties with Australia and
New Zealand and with the Philippines.
Article III is the heart of the treaty. Under
that article each party—
recognizes that an armed attack in the Pacific area on
either of the Parties in territories now under their re-
spective administrative control, or hereafter recognized
by one of the Parties as lawfully brought under the
administrative control of the other, would be dangerous
to its own peace and safety and declares that it would
act to meet the common danger in accordance with its
constitutional processes.
This language is the same as the com arable ro-
visions in the treaties with Australia and ew
Zealand and with the Philippines except that it
deﬁnes the area within which the treat is to
operate, namely in territories now un er the
res ective administrative control of either party,
or iereafter recognized by one of the parties as
lawfully brought under the administrative con-
trol of the other. This provision is designed to
take cognizance of the fact that the Republic of
