Dulles has told on that no planning could have
anticipated all t e moves made by so shrewd an
old hand as Molotov. The unity that emerged
was the natural and spontaneous reaction of men
who shared the same ideals, men dedicated to the
same concepts of human liberty and national
int ity.
ﬁr Molotov struck a stone wall in Berlin when
he tried to “sell” the French and the British on
capitulation to totalitarianism—the Governments
of both, as well as that of the United States, re-
jected, without hesitation, the Soviet oﬁ'er of
‘peace” on Soviet terms. "

We had roposed, in agreement with President
Rhee, that t e conference be held in Geneva. That
proposal had been rejected.
l e had pro osed, also in agreement with Pres-
ident Rhee, t at the conference should include
Communist China, Soviet Russia, North Korea,
and, on the United Nations side, the Republic of
Korea and the 16 United Nations member nations
who had fought in Korea. ‘ .
All this the Communists had refused. In Ber-
lin each proppsal was accepted. The Soviets, to
be sure, oug t each item and, as Mr. Dulles told
us so dramatically in his r dio address,2 they con-
tinued to ﬁght until just 60 minutes before the
Berlin conference adjourned.
The Soviets fought for recognition of Com-
munist China as a great “power.” This, indeed,
was one of their major objectives in Berlin.
They capitulated on that issue only when they
saw it was hopeless to ex t the W'est to yield.
Mr. Dulles, in his openlng statement on January
26,3 made the position of the United States crystal
clear. He said:
. I would like to state here plainly and unequivo-
cally what the Soviet Forcle Minister already knows—
the United States will not agree to join in a ﬁve-power
conference with the Chinese Communist aggressors for
the purpose of dealing generally with the peace of the
world.
The United States refuses not because. as is suggested,
it denies that the regime exists, or that it has power.
We in the United States well know that it exists and has
power, because its ailgressive armies Joined with the
North Korean aggressors to kill and wound 150,000 Amer-
;icans. We do not refuse to deal with it where
occasion requires. It is, however, one thing to
recognize evil as a fact. It is another thing to take evil
to one's breast and call it good.
Mr. Molotov, in Berlin, used a promise of eace
in Indochina as bait for the West. That he ailed
is to the credit of that Nation which has, indeed,
suffered cruelly through Communist activities in
Indochina.
The Soviets have tried to use French hopes for
peace in Indochina in an attempt to slow down, if

munity.
As the United States sees itz Enc is an important
step toward the security of Free Europe, and in-
cidentally, our own. President Eisenhower is
deeply convinced that there can be no long-term
assurance of security and vitality for Euro , and
therefore for the Western \Vorld including the
United States unless there is unity in Europe
which will inciude France and German .
In the words of our able Secretary 0 State:
Until the goals of Enc are achieved, Nuo, and indeed
future peace, are in JeOpardy.
We have, and are urging Eno upon our Euro-
pean friends. but they are independent nations
and we cannot compel them to act. Our concept
of unity does not include compulsion. They are
not satellites. \Ve of the free alliance are equals.
Ri htly or wrongly we make our own decisions.
\'e must understand the reasons for past
French hesitation re arding Enc. Originally, of
course, the idea was rench. Her leading states-
men are still in favor of it. The French people,
however, ﬁnd it hard to forget their ancient con-
ﬂicts with Germany. They fear a re-armed Ger-
man State.
The fact is, of course, that Enc is desi ed to
protect them against just that danger. at to
many Frenchmen the ve thought of a German
in uniform brings memories that are still bitterly
fresh—memories not of one war but, to some,
of three.
Understanding that is not too diﬁicult. There
are places in the Deep South in our own country
where memories much older than those of the
French still motivate certain reactions. The old
stor of the man who grew up believing “dam-
yan ” was one word isn t funny in Geor ia.
The Europeans have made remarkab e rog-
ress in the past 10 ears toward unity. here
is the Organization or European Economic Co-
(liperation, the Council of Europe, the European
ayments Union and, of course, the European
Coal and Steel Community, all now functioning.
The Berlin conference has probably helped E00
by making it clear that Russia is not genuinely
prepared to offer any alternative arrangement to
protect the peace and security of Europe.
The demonstration at Berlin of the solidarity
of the West was a solid achievement. And they
are standing by that solidarity. Eventually, we
can hope, they will see that the E00 is more than
just a demonstration of solidarity, but solidarity
in fact.
The Berlin conference demonstrated equall
clearly that the danger from Moscow is unabat
The ultimate Soviet aim is still the destruction
and conquest of the free world. This aim un-
doubted] will prevail until the Soviet people
can freeiy express themselves; until the Soviet
totalitarian structure has gone the way of all
dictatorships and is only history.
