Sateguards to lndlvldull
Now the uestion is often raised as to whether
this system is fair to the individual or not. The
system has many safeguards. In my judgment
one of the most important is the objective ap-
roach of those individuals employed in our
Evaluations Unit who make the primary judg-
ment in each case. If their determination is a -
verse to the emplo ee, the ﬁle is then forwarded
to the Director of t e Ofﬁce of Security, a Foreign
Service ofﬁcer of considerable experience both in
the Department and in the Security ﬁeld. He
must personally affirm the judgment of the Evalu-
ations Unit before the ﬁle is forwarded to me. I
personal] review the evaluation and if I agree
forwar it to the Under Secretary for Adminis-
tration. If he in turn agrees with my judgment,
the ﬁle is then forwarded to the Secretary. You
will observe that this system requires a minimum
of ﬁve personal evaluations of a security case be-
fore an employee is actually suspended from the
Department. It seems to me that this system of
ﬁve separate and distinct jud ents more than
safeguards the employee against ca ricious or
unreasonable action on the part of t e Govern-
ment.
Most ublic interest centers on the em loyee
cases. he Security Ofﬁce has the responsrbility
for making the ﬁnal determination on applicant
cases unless the applicant is a Presidential ap-
pointee. Following the ﬁve afﬁrmative decisions
that the employee’s continued employment is not
clearly consrstent with the national security, the
employee is suspended and furnished a written let-
ter of charges. This letter is as speciﬁc as secu-
rity practices will permit. Obviously, it would
be unwise to create a dan er to the national secu-
rity by advising an emp oyee of the individuals
who had furnished information with respect to
subversive activities. On the other hand, there
aglpears to me to be no sound reason why persons
w o furnish information with respect to behavior
patterns and personal habits of employees should
not be requested to identify themselves and face
those they accuse. In eneral terms, such is the
policy we pursue in the epartment.
After receiving a letter of charges, the employee
may ﬁle an answer in writing for such su porting
evidence as he may care to submit. At this point
another judgment is made. This judgment is by
the Security Counsel for the Department and by
me, acting either jointly or severally. If we make
a recommendation for dismissal, our 'udgment is
again subject to the scrutin of the nder Secre-
tary for Administration an , if he agrees with us,
then by the Secretary of State. If it is deter-
mined that it is desirable in the national interest
to discharge the employee, the em loyee is so noti-
ﬁed. He then has recourse to a earin before a
three-man plane] of Federal employees om other
agencies. his hearin is conducted under the
direction of the Civil ervice Commission. The
opinion of the panel is furnished to the Secretary
of State as an advisory opinion, and he may accept
or reject it, and thus ﬁnally conclude the case.
As I have indicated to you, I believe that per-
sonnel integrity and security are important rob-
lems, articularly when the free world is aced
with t e enormous conspiracy known as Soviet
communism. This conspiracy is a new danger to
our liberties. It has arisen as a clear and present
menace within the last quarter of a century. It
is something which our society has not encountered
in the past. America has successfull contended
with dangers to its freedoms during t e course of
its history, so that those of us who live in Amer-
ica today ﬁnd that freedom is our heritage. \Ve
must be sure that freedom is our legacy.
