inforced to regimental-size and ﬁnally after ﬁve hours of
bitter lighting the United Nations Command forces with-
drew slightly. The last action of the period. west of the
regimental attack of 23 July. occurred on 25 July when
another Chinese regiment assaulted the main line of re-
sistance positions for over two hours before heavy United
Nations Command ﬁres forced the enemy to withdraw.
Elements of another United Nations Command division
south of KL'MSONG experienced ten attacks of company
and battalion-size during the period. These attacks were
all carried out between 21 and 24 July and resulted in
minor losses of terrain for the United Nations Command.
In most cases the Chinese were compelled to withdraw
due to the heavy ﬁre placed on their assault units by the
United Nations Command. Although several penetrations
of the United Nations Command main line of resistance
were made. vigorous United Nations Command counter-
attacks resulted. in most instances, in a resumption of
United Nations Command control.
Slightly to the east in an adjacent United Nations Com-
mand division heavy ﬁghting commencing on 13 July con-
tinued on into late July. The Chinese maintained
pressure with an undetermined large number of enemy con—
tinuing the action until 21 July. At this time there was
a marked decrease in enemy activity and for several days
contact with the enemy was maintained only by aggressive
United Nations Command patrols. The Chinese came back
with a two platoon probe against an outpost of the divi-
sion shortly before daybreak on 26 July. This probe lasted
for over eight hours before the enemy completely with-
drew. Subsequently, two enemy companies struck against
the same friendly outpost the following evening. However,
this enemy force found stiffening resistance and remained
in contact for only one hour before withdrawing.
As the period opened a United Nations Command divi-
sion was deployed astride the PUKHAN River. Later in
the period another United Nations Command division re
lieved the former as the battle for the KUMSONG Bulge
continued to bring pressure against elements of the United
Nations Command across the central front. Early in the
period the enemy was still pushing south overrunning
United Nations Command positions due to the overwhelm-
ing weight of his assault forces. By 18 July the friendly
forces in this sector were beginning to contain and stabil-
ize the front. As enemy attacks waned in intensity, the
United Nations Command elements began a series of coun-
terattacks to seize the initiative. However. the enemy
continued to launch attacks to keep pressure on the United
Nations Command. Typical of the ﬁve company to bat-
talion-size actions reported was the enemy battalion attack
of 20 July. In this assault the enemy struck friendly main
line of resistance positions shortly after dark and the
mass of the enemy force broke into the United Nations
Command trenches and engaged the United Nations Com-
mand defenders in a bitter hand-tohand battle. Three
hours of intense ﬁghting for control of the position ended
with the determined United Nations Command troops still
denying occupancy of the position to the Chinese. After
this depleted enemy force withdrew early on 21 July, the
Chinese remained relatively quiet in this sector until the
armistice.
There was an intensiﬁcation of enemy activity across
the eastern front in comparison to the relative inactivity
of the previous period. A total of eighteen enemy ini-
tiated actions of company-size or larger occurred. These
enemy attacks were concentrated against XMAS Hill
south of MULGUJI, Hill 812—Hiil 854 complex south of
SOHL‘I, and outpost positions south of KOSONG.
During the period one United Nations Command divi-
sion. deployed between the PUKHAN River and the MUN-
DUNG-Nl Valley, experienced three attacks of company-
size or larger. These attacks were in cousouance with
those of the previous period against elements of this divi-
sion. An enemy company probed outpost positions in the
division‘s sector early on 18 July for one hour before with-
drawing. Shortly after this action began, an enemy bat-
talion, slightly to the east of the other action, assaulted
outposts of the division. The enemy was again repelled
after approximately 8 two hour ﬁreﬁght. Further east
another enemy battalion attacked outposts of the same
division and engaged the United Nations Command de-
fenders in hand-tohand combat. A vicious battle ensued
with the United Nations Command relinquishing control
of a platoon-size outpoat for several hours. Subsequently
a determined United Nations Command counterattack re-
secured the position. with the remnants of the enemy
force withdrawing shortly after daybreak on 18 July.
Throughout the remainder of the period this sector was
inactive, with the exception of several minor probes on
19 July.
The United Nations Command division astrlde the
SOYANG Valley experienced a marked increase in enemy
attention. In the Hill 812 complex south of SOHUI the
enemy brieﬂy probed United Nations Command positions
with a company on the night of 16—17 July. This action
was quickly followed by a platoon attack in which the
enemy reinforced to battalion-size and overran the United
Nations Command main line of resistance. Concurrently,
an enemy company attack slightly to the east was success-
ful. after a bitter battle in the United Nations Command
trenches, in throwing back the United Nations Command.
Shortly thereafter the enemy occupied the position with
two battalions. The attacks for control of Hill 812 re-
sulted in enemy casualties estimated at 160 killed in
action and 260 wounded in action.
Early on the morning of 18 July the enemy attempted to
expand his success on Hill 812 by attacking Hill 854, east
of the SOYANG Valley, with a regimental-size assault
force. Although the enemy supported the effort with
30,000 rounds of artillery and mortar, the assaulting force
broke and withdrew after approximately four hours of
determined attacks. Thence until the armistice on 27
July, the enemy probed these positions with minor size
forces; however, no actions of signiﬁcance occurred.
In one United Nations Command division sector south
of KOSONG enemy activity was particularly intense fol-
lowing a lengthy period of inactivity. The enemy launched
eleven attacks of company-size or larger against United
Nations Command outpost or main line of resistance poai-
tions in this area. The attacks were all brief and of
little consequence, with the exception of an attack the
enemy mounted with a company about daybreak on 18
July. The enemy struck against United Nations Command
main line of resistance positions and after a ﬁerce close-in
battle the enemy overrun one United Nations Command
position. Elements of the United Nations Command divi-
sion launched an aggressive counterattack about mid-
morning but were repulsed by a strong enemy force on the
objective. This sector of the front remained active until
27 July with the position remaining under enemy control.
United Nations Command naval aircraft, operating from
fast attack carriers in the Sea of Japan continued their
attacks on preselected targets and targets of opportunity
from the main line of resistance to the Manchurian Border.
More than four thousand sorties were ﬂown during the
period 16 through 27 July. The major eﬁort of naval air
during this period was directed against Communist front
line and supporting positions. On 13 July, in order to
counter an apparent effort by the Communist forces to
gain ground along the front line prior to an armistice.
maximum support was directed along the battleiine. In
furtherance of this effort four carriers carried out oper-
ations on around-the-ciock basis until 27 July at 22001.
The targets on these strikes in direct support of friendly
troops, for the most part, consisted of enemy supply and
iiilleting areas, gun positions, bunkers, main supply routes,
and trenches. Accurate evaluation of the results of many
of these attacks was prohibited due to the nature of the
target or to the nature of this type of mission.
The main supply routes throughout Northeast Korea
were also struck daily in an effort to minimize the ﬂow of
supplies to enemy forces committed to the front line.
These attacks resulted in the destruction of numerous
railcars, trucks, and other rolling stock. In addition,
