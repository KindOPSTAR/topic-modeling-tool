FOA Allots Funds to Greece
and the Netherlands
The Foreign Operations Administration on
April 7 announced new allotments of $10 million
for Greece and $4 million for the Netherlands
from mutual security program funds of the cur-
rent ﬁscal year.
The new funds for Greece, in addition to $1
million allotted last September and $4 million in
November are made available to support the Greek
defense eﬁ'ort. The $10 million allotment will
ﬁnance the procurement of agricultural commodi-
ties as well as chemicals, fuels, and other Greek
dollar import requirements.
The allotment for the Netherlands, which will
ﬁnance the procurement of surplus cottonseed oil
in the United States, has been made under the
provisions of section 550 of the Mutual Security
Act of 1953. This section provides that between
$100 million and $250 million of mutual security
appropriations for the current ﬁscal year shall be
used to ﬁnance surplus U.S. agricultural commodi-
ties to _be sold to friendly countries for local
currencies.
The equivalent of $4 million in Netherlands
guilders, derived from the sale of the cottonseed
oil, will be used for degaussing the Dutch merchant
ﬂeet. Degaussing is a process which neutralizes
the magnetic properties of steel ships as a safe-
guard against magnetic mines.

650,000 under section 550 to ﬁnance such surplus
commodity sales to the United Kingdom, Federal

Voluntary Agencies To Aid in
Technical Cooperation Program
The Director of the Foreign Operations Ad-
ministration, Harold E. Stassen, on April 8 an-
nounced plans for developing closer relationships
with voluntary a ncies in t e technical coopera-
tion programs 0 FOA. _These agencies are pri-
vat_e,_nonproﬁt organizations of a philanthropic or
religious nature.
This is the second step taken in recent months
by. Foa to increase the active participation by
private nongovernmental oups in US. programs
of cooperation with the ree peo les in the less
developed countries of the Far ast, Near East,
ASia, Africa, and Latin America. Earlier, Mr.
Stassen announced that many of next year’s proJ-
ects would be carried out through the use of 1, 2,
and 3 year contracts With American univers1ties
and land-grant colleges.
Mr. Stassen said:
In our world-wide reviews of the FDA programs, we
have seen evidence of very beneﬁcial results from pro-
grams emphasizing a “people-to-people” approach.
Through closer relationships with the voluntary groups,
the colleges and universities, we hope to draw on the
wealth of experience and technical knowledge that these
groups have gained in conducting their own programs of
a similar nature—both in the United States and abroad.
Many of the voluntary agencies have pioneered in work
with people of the underdeveloped lands and have gained
their conﬁdence and respect. We recognize the valuable
contributions their experience can make toward achiev-
ing objectives which they share with Fon.
Under the new plan, private nonproﬁt organiza-
tions experienced in operations outside the United
States will be invited to play a more active long-
range role in the Foa technical cooperation pro-
grams. The new arrangements with the volunteer
groups will be of both a contractual and non-
contractual nature.
