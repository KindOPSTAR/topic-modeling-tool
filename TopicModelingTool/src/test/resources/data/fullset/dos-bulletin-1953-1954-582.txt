the Congress for further developments in Ameri-
can international economic policy.‘
I would not wish to leave the surve of \Vestern
Europe without commenting on the lighly origi-
nal and informative analysis of the course of
production and demand in four European coun-
tries. The facts developed and methods of pres-
entation will afford an extremely useful basis for
future discussion and analysis. There is clearly,
however, scope for differences of interpretation so
far as some of the policy implications which are
drawn are concerned.
The view that the impact of government policies
on demand, from an economic point of view, has
been of an arbitrary and almost accidental charac-
ter needs, perhaps, some qualiﬁcation. In our
own view the survey underestimates the role and
signiﬁcance of governmental ﬁscal and monetary
policies in the curtailment of effective demand
and the achievement of internal ﬁnancial stability.
The stringent measures adopted b most European
governments curtailing many ﬁel s of government
activity and discouraging personal consum tion
have been of major importance in holding own
demand.
For the future, the survey advocates major re-
liance on public expenditures, rather than on such
measures as reduction of taxes, to achieve eco-
nomic ex ansion. In suggesting that “the bal-
ance of a vantage lies in concentrating primarily
on promoting economic expansion through public
spending,” the survey again tends to underestimate
t 1e danger of the effect of such policies on a re-
newal of inﬂation and does not give suﬂicient at-
tention to methods, in addition to tax incentives,
throu h which economic ex ansion might be pro-
motedg without the great ris s to internal ﬁnancial
stability entailed in heavy dependence on govern-
ment spending. As already indicated by the plans
recentl submitted by some Western European
countries, these include a wide variety of ﬁnancial,
ﬁscal, and technical measures designed to increase
the competitiveness of their industries in Euro-
pean and world markets, to facilitate investment
and extension of credits, and, concomitant with
an improvement in production, productivity, and
development of broader markets, to raise purchas-
inv ower.
The survey correctly concludes that the means
to a solution of the problem of sustained economic
expansion “are only very partially within the con-
trol of individual countrles.” Participation in a
wide variety of international organizations dedi-
cated to a solution of common problems, such as
the United Nations Economic Commission for
Europe, is in itself recognition of that need for
common action in a wider context, to which the
survey refers. At the same time, there are many
important steps which individual countries can
and should take on their initiative and responsi-

bility, without waiting for developments on a
broader basis. The level of reserves within Eu-
rope today, and the substantial progress already
made in bettering the structural position of Eu-
rope within the world economy, have ver largely
increased the capability of Europe to dea with its
roblems at its own initiative and in its own ways.

Sovlot Unlon and Eastern Europe
In turning from \Vestern Europe to the East,
I wish again to con ratulate those responsible for
this years survey or a workmanlike job. This
year’s survey presents a far more realistic ap-
praisal of economic conditions in Eastern Europe
than has been the case in the past.
In making this appraisal, the Ear: Secretariat
has been asmsted in no small measure by a series
of straightforward statements and decrees by the
chief s okesmen and the governing bodies of these
countries. This is particularly so in the case of
the USSR.
These statements and government decrees point
to the fact that the consumer sectors of the econ-
omies of the countries concerned have suffered in
the past in comparison with the producer and de-
fense sectors of these economies. And these same
statements and decrees clearly assert, in the words
of the survey, “that a greater effort is now to be
made to raise the standards of Ian fulﬁllment
above the levels which have tende to rule hitherto
in the consumer sector of the economy.”
The survey rightly stresses that the extent to
which the Soviet and Eastern Euro can govern-
ments are prepared to raise substantia ly the stand-
ards of living of their citizens will necessarily
depend on the extent to which they are prepared
to forego previously planned increases in arma-
ments and heavy industry. There appears, how-
ever, to be little evidence of an intention to aban-
don previous goals for the producer and arma-
ments sectors of the Soviet economy. It would
not be unreasonable to assume, therefore, that the
upsurge in the consumer sector of this economy is
to result primarily from extra efforts rather than
from any shift of emphasis in investment. The
survey does not speciﬁcally draw this inference
but does emphasize that, on this all-important
question, no information is as yet forthcoming.
The survey also states that “the problems of
[Soviet] agriculture, and those industries based on
it, are far more complex,” and that “there is some
reason to think that hopes may have been pre-
maturely set on faster results than it would be
reasonable to expect within the next 2 or 3 years,
especially in the key sector of animal husbandry.”
This judgment seems to have been conﬁrmed less
than a fortnight ago by reports of a new Soviet
decree to the effect that drastic measures will be
