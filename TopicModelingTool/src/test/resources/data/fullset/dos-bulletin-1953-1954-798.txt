fession must band together to show that the United
States is a great or anism of free men who put
freedom above all 0t er values.
I sometimes think that Patrick Henry may have
overstated the case—for any one of us may not
quite accept and live by his immortal statement:
‘ Give me liberty or give me death.” But I still
believe that that statement is true for our race.
We will accept nothing over and above freedom.
And as long as we live that—and believe in it—
and do our work in that spirit, to my mind, Amer-
ica is not onl safe but America is going forward
in the expan in and growing economy that will
bring greater an greater happiness to our people,
security for us, an promote peace in the worl .
REMARKS BY SECRETARY DULLES
Press release 268 dated May 20.
I ave some thought this mornin to whether I
shoﬁd tell you about some of the t ings that are
on my mind today and talk about my business;
or whether I wouldn’t do better to talk about your
business. I decided that it is easier and always
safer to talk about the other fellow’s business.
So, you will excuse me, I ho e, if I do not talk
to you about the problems of In ochina and Guate-
mala and other parts of the world which occupy
me very much at the moment. Instead I would
like to direct myself to some of the more basic
problems with which you deal and which are also
of great importance to any United States Secre-
tary of State. I am convinced that, unless the
problems with which you deal are solved in the
way in which you are trying to solve them, it will
not be possible for me or any other United States
Secretary of State to carry out successfully United
States foreign policy.
In order to have a successful United States
foreign policy it is necessary to have back of you
a society of freedom which produces the fruits
which people want. This Nation had a very suc-
cessful foreign policy over a large part of its
national life, particularly during its early years.
This was because the United States was producing
in a spectacular way, out of the efforts of free men
in a free society, results which were so rich in
terms not merely of economics, but of intellectual,
spiritual results, that what we did caught the
imagination of people all over the world. It
became known as the “Great American Experi-
ment.” Everyone wanted to do what we were
doing. They wanted to ﬁnd out how we got that
way, what it was that made us tick. When they
did ﬁnd out, they wanted to do the same thing
for themselves. The result was that we had an
environment all around us of friendly and admir-
ing peoples who were eager to take guidance and
leadership from the United States. In those days
being Secretary of State was a leisurely, gentle-
manl job, because most of the work was done for
the Secretary of State by American people all
around the world who were selling Americanism.
In recent years, it seems to me, there has devel-
oped a big question mark throughout much of the
world as to whether or not a free society is really
what its ossessors claim for it. That is, whether
men wou dn’t get along better under a society of
conformity, a society of dictatorship, where the
government took responsibility for everything
that was done and where the human beings merely
carried out the directions of someone who told
them what to do. Then, everything would be
directed in accordance with economic planning
and there would be no freedom of choice on the
part of the individuals as far as their economic
ife was concerned or, indeed, as far as their intel-
lectual or spiritual life was concerned.
Emphasis on Government Activity
As I say, this freedom that we have is not the
dynamic force which it once was. There has
grown up in much of the world a feeling, which
to some extent has prevailed in our own country,
that the real test 0 a nation’s achievements was
to be found in the ﬁgures of what the government
itself did, and that what was done outside of gov-
ernment activity did not count for much in the
scales. In my opinion, if that thesis can’t be dis-
proved and if we can’t demonstrate the capacity
of free men to develop an economy which is ex-
panding, which has a high level of employment—
if that can’t be demonstrated, then the bottom is
going to fall out in the United States foreign
policy. In that event we are on the defensive
throughout the world. \Ve soon will be isolated
in the world. And once that happens the ﬁrst
thing we know we may be compelled, merely by
the pressure of events and by the magnitude of
the forces in other systems, ourselves to fall in
with that system.
I brought with me a couple of speeches which
I made on earlier dates, when I had time to pre-
pare myself. I want to refer ﬁrst to a speech
which I made before I became Secretary of State
in December 1952. In that speech I talked about
freedom and its purposes, and I ended up by re-
ferring to the hopes and expectations that were
placed in the Eisenhower Administration, which
I believed would be realized, and I said this:
Perhaps the best that it can do will be to encourage, and
make place for, the individual and group efforts which are
the most precious jewels of freedom. Nothing has been
more disastrous in the cause of freedom than the growing
assumption that nothing happens unless government does
I would also like to refer to a speech which I
made in Caracas a little earlier this year.l There
