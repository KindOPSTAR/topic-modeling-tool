year and 3 months and am glad of this oppor-
tunity before this inﬂuential audience to set down
the high opinion which I have of so many of the
men and women with whom I have wor ed and
who have spent their lives working for the United
States in the field of foreign relations. There has
been so much publicity since World War II about
a few rotten apples that we have lost si ht of the
many excellent persons giving service t at is not
only faithful but skillful in a high degree and
utterly indispensable to our survival as a nation.
We all owe a real debt to men like Robert Mur-
hy, who is Deputy Under Secretary of State;
avid Key, the Assistant Secretary for United
Nations Affairs; Livingston Merchant, Assistant
Secretary for European Affairs; Henry Byroade,
Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern, South
Asian and African Aﬁ'airs; Douglas MacArthur
II, Counselor for the De artment of State. There
are 40 career Amb ors-—people like George
Allen in India, Charles E. Bohlen in the Soviet
Union, Jefferson Caﬁ'ery in Egypt, James Dunn
in S ain, Loy Henderson in Iran, John Cabot in
Swe en, James Riddleberger in Yugoslavia,
Harold Tittmann in Peru, and Fletcher Warren
in Venezuela—all of these ofﬁcers and others like
them are rendering priceless service to their coun-
try in posts which call for the exercise of the most
ex uisite judgment and which require a knowledge
ofqhow to get thin done in oreign countries
which is possessed very few Americans. If
we did not have ofﬁcials like them we would be
in very serious trouble. I wish we had more of
them, and I hope that youn men and women of
similar uality from one on of our Nation to the
other will plan to make a career in the ﬁeld of
foreign relations so that for the future of our
country we will have a supply of these indispensa-
ble public ofﬁcials.
The United Nations is one great factor in the
ﬁeld of foreign relations which must have par-
ticular meanin for a newspaperman—and I speak
as one who sti considers himself to be basically
a member of that profession. The powers of the
United Nations to take actions which are legally
binding are very few in number. They are limited
exclusively to the Security Council, where the
United States is com letely protected by the right
of veto. The overw elmlng majorit of United
Nations actions are purely recommen atory. The
reason that they have such great weight is because
of the force of public opinion—in this case world
opinion.
And world public opinion, while it does not
react as rapidly as public 0 inion does in an Amer-
ican city or State or in the nited States, is never-
theless a very real force.
It was world opinion which was so informed
and stimulated by the proceedin in the United
Nations in 1946 that the Soviet nion withdrew
the troops which they had in Northern Iran which
were a ve real threat to the integrity of that
country an to the entire region, a region which is
so highly strategic to the interests of our countr —
as well as to the interests of the people who ive
there.
It was the force of world opinion, which was
again stimulated by the United Nations, which
made our resistance to Communist aggression in
Korea considerably more than it would have been
if the United Nations had never existed.
The contribution of the United Nations to our
resistance to Communist aggression in Korea is
not limited to the fact that it added two divisions
which we would have otherwise had to supply our-
selves and which would have cost us $600 million a
year—and this ﬁgure, when compared to our con-
tributions of $13 million a ear to the United Na-
tions proper, does not seem ike a bad deal.
The contribution of the United Nations to our
resistance to a gression in Korea is not limited to
the fact that 51s presence of those two divisions
meant that other young men risked becoming cas-
ualties which otherwise might have been the fate
of American boys.
Those are worthwhile contributions—and they
could have been even larger if mistaken policies
had not been followed in Washington in those
years—policies which required countries having
military manpower, but not having dollars, to
reimburse us in dollars for the su plies and equi -
ment which we rovided. This e rived us of tfie
manpower whic otherwise would ave been avail-
able. It was a reversal of World War II policy.
It is a mistake, by the way, which will not be re-
peated in the future.
But these things, although of the ﬁrst impor-
tance, are not all that the United Nations contrib-
uted to resisting aggression in Korea.
The fact that the United Nations condemned
Communist ag ession at once made the whole
action one base on principle and not on American
strategic self-preservation. This completely
foiled the Communist propaganda line that action
in Korea was controlled by the power politics of
the Wall Street imperialists.
Another valuable result of United Nations in-
tervention which would also never have taken
lace without the United Nations was due to the
act that soldiers of so many races, religions, and
colors, including such widel separated nations as
Turke , Ethiopia, Thailands,’ the Philip ines, and
Colom ia, among the total 16, were in t e battle-
line. It thus became impossible for the Commu-
nists to maintain successfully that our action in
Korea was another example of the white man
trying to dominate colored people and reestablish
colonialism.
Iran and Korea are two illustrations of what
public opinion can do when it is rallied as it was
at the United Nations.
The United Nations serves many other useful
purposes in the ﬁeld of public 0 inion.
It is, for one thing, a place w ere you can get
the feel of world opinion. On one occasion, Mr.
Vyshinsky, with upraised ﬁst, turned to me and
