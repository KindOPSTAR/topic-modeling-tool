REORGANIZATION PLAN NO. I.1
I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 1
of 1954, prepared in accordance with the Reorgan-
ization Act of 1949, as amended.
The reorganization plan establishes a new Gov-
ernment agency, the Foreign Claims Settlement
Commission of the United States; transfers to that
Commission the functions of the War Claims Com-
mission and of the International Claims Commis-
sion of the United States; and abolishes the latter
two Commissions.
The Foreign Claims Settlement Commission
will be composed of three members appointed by
the President by and with the advice and consent
of the Senate. The President will designate one
of the members as Chairman of the Commission.
The Chairman will be responsible for the internal
management of the affairs of the Commission.
The reorganization plan contains provisions de-
signed to assure smooth administration of func-
tions during the period of transition to the new
organization.
The War Claims Commission was created as a
temporary agency by the War Claims Act of 1948.
The Commission was made responsible for settling
certain claims of former United States World War
II prisoners of war, civilian internees captured or
in iiding to avoid capture in the Philippines,
Guam, Wake Island, and the Midway Islands, and
certain religious organizations in the Philippines
which had aided American forces during the war.
In 1952, the Commission was assigned, addition-
ally, the administration of claims of Philippine
religious organizations which sustained losses of
their educational, medical, and welfare facilities
in the war, and of beneﬁts to United States rison-
ers of war for inhumane treatment during intern-
ment by the enemy.
From its inception in 1949 to April 1, 1954, ap-
roximately 500,000 claims were ﬁled with the War
laims Commission, and approximately $134,000,-

000 was paid to claimants. Approximately 96,000
remaining claims are in the process of settlement,
and the Commission must complete action on them,
together with such appeals as may be ﬁled, by
March 31, 1955.
The International Claims Commission was es-
tablished within the Department of State by the
International Claims Settlement Act of 1949. Its
immediate function was to adjudicate claims cov-
ered by a settlement of $17,000,000 which was de-
osited with the Government of the United States
y the Yugoslav Government primarily to com-
pensate our nationals for losses sustained through
nationalization of properties. The act also au-
thorized the Commission to settle such claims as
might be included later in any similar agreement
between the United States and a foreign govern-
ment. Subsequently, the Commission was as-
signed the administration of a $400,000 settlement
negotiated with the Government of Panama.
From its establishment in 1950 to April 1, 1954,
the International Claims Commission has settled
531 claims out of a total of 1,622 ﬁled. Of this
total, 1,555 claims were against Yugoslavia and
67 were against Panama. Under the act, settle-
ment of the remaining Yugoslav claims must be
com leted by December 31, 1954.
T ie accompanying reorganization lan has sub-
stantial potential advantages. he Foreign
Claims Settlement Commission will be able to ad-
minister any additional claims programs ﬁnanced
by funds derived from foreign governments with-
out the delay which has often characterized the
initiation of past programs. Moreover, the use of
an existing agency will be more economical than
the establishment of a new commission to admin-
ister a given type of foreign claims program.
Consolidation of the affairs of the two present
Commissions will also permit the retention and
use of the best experience gained during the last
several years in the ﬁeld of claims settlement. The
declining workload of current programs can be
meshed with the rising workload of new programs
with maximum efﬁciency and effectiveness.
