rector of the Foreign Operations Administration,
will participate in the negotiations for the United
States.
The negotiations follow preliminary talks con-
cernin a loan to the Coal and Steel Community
whiclﬁiave taken place during the past months.
These talks had their origin in the view expressed
by President Eisenhower in June 1953, that ﬁnanc-
ing of a portion of the Hi h Authority’s invest-
ment program by the U.S. overnment or one of
its agencies would foster European integration
in a tangible and useful way.3

livered a note to the Czechoslovak Ministry of
Foreign Affairs on March 24, 1.954, in res onse to
