A Record for Polltlcal Cynlclsm
In the light of what was to hap en in that
summer of 1940, when the Kremlin too over these
three small countries by force, we can now see that
the international record for political cynicism was
reached in the speech Molotov made on October 31,
1939.
Speakin of the mutual assistance pacts with
the Baltic States, Molotov then said:
The special character of these mutual assistance pacts,
in no way implies any interference on the part of the
Soviet Union in the aﬂairs of Esthonia, Latvia or Lithu-
ania. . . . On the contrary, all these pacts of mutual
assistance strictly stipulate the inviolability of the sover-
eignty of the signatory states and the principle of non-
interference in each other's affairs. . . . We stand for
the scrupulous and punctilious observance of the pacts on
the basis of complete reciprocity, and we declare that all
the nonsensical talk about the Sovietization of the Baltic
countries is only to the interest of our common enemies
and of all anti-Soviet provocateurs.
That statement of Molotov’s was not the ﬁrst in
the long line of promises made and broken, of
agreements solemnly signed and systematically
violated, with which the Soviet Government has
blotted the pages of its di lomatic history—nor
was it to be the last, as we have learned by bitter
experience.
Along with the takeover of the Baltic States,
the Soviet power system expanded into the Ru-
manian territories of Bessarabia and Bukovina.
But even these did not satisfy Soviet ambitions.
From captured documents in the Nazi Foreign
Office, we know now that Stalin’s price for joining
the Axis included not onl the seizure of these
territories in Euro e but a so a free hand in Fin-
land, Bul ria, an Eastern Turkey and the right
to expan through the Turkish Straits into the
Mediterranean and through Persia, into India.8
These far-reaching ambitions ﬁnally so alarmed
Hitler that he decided they threatened his own
plans for conquest and that the threat must be
crushed. When Hitler turned u n Stalin, Stalin
turned to the Western democracies for help—help
that was 'ven in full measure but never as fully
acknowledged.
With the disintegration of the Nazi military
ower and political control in central Europe un-
der the hammering of the Allied armies on the
West and the Soviet armies on the East, the Soviet
power system moved in behind its advancing
troops. The Red Arm occupied Eastern Ger-
many and Austria, all 0 Poland, most of Czecho-
slovakia, all of Rumania, Hungary, and Bulgaria.
Military control of these areas was supplemented
by political control exercised through cadres of
trusted Communist agents both homegrown and
Moscow-trained. Communist military and olit-
ical agents and advisers dominated Yugoslavia
and Albania.
The rest of Europe was war-weary and ex-
hausted. This seemed indeed to the men in the
'Ibid., pp. 255-259.
Kremlin the ideal time to put into effect the true
Soviet aims, regardless of the desires of the peoples
concerned.
The Soviet pattern of consolidating its power
system in Europe during the postwar years is
familiar to all of us. In the areas occupied by
the Soviet armed forces trusted Communists were
placed in key posts in the new governments oppo-
sition leaders were ruthlessly eliminated by im-
prisonment, death, or exile. In 4 short years the
regimes of all the countries of Eastern Europe
were Sovietized. The countries themselves were
given the supremely ironic title of “People’s De-
mocracies.” They were neither democracies nor
did they belong to the people—they belonged to
their Soviet masters.
In Western Euro e, on which the Communist
conspirators also ha designs, things did not 0 so
easily. In the ﬁrst place, the copies of tiese
countries were forewarned by t e fate of their
neighbors to the East. They had time and op-
portunity to move to protect themselves. More-
over, as Stalin once openly com lained, the Soviet
Communist Fifth Column in \ estern Europe was
obliged to operate without the support and pro-
tection of Soviet armed forces.
Compelled, therefore, to content itself with a
mere half of the European Continent, Soviet com-
munism concentrated on intensifying and con-
solidating its control over the captured countries.
The plan was to reorient the entire life of this
area away from the \Vest and in the direction of
Moscow. All these countries were to become
obedient suppliers of the Soviet economy and, par-
ticularly, of the Soviet war potential. In agri-
culture, the Soviet pattern of collectivized farming
was introduced in the face of stubborn opposition
by the peasants. The natural resources of these
lands were systematically exploited for Soviet
beneﬁt. Industries were ordered to ear their out-
put to Soviet production. Inevitab y, as a result
of such measures the standards of living of the
populations of the captured countries steadily
dropped. At the same time the hated Communist
secret police system was fastened on each country,
and national armies became mere auxiliaries of
the Soviet armed forces.
As a result of this relentless process of Soviet-
ization, the Soviet Union has converted virtually
the whole of Eastern Euro e from the Baltic to
the Aegean into what is to a l intents and purposes
an advance military base. This base is the spear-
head of the Soviet power system in Europe.
The Facts of Soviet Power
In the rush of events, which tend to distract our
attention elsewhere, we are occasionally inclined
to forget or to push to the backs of our minds the
hard and unpleasant facts which make this Soviet
powersystem which I have describe'da constant
threat to the security of Europepand to our
security.
