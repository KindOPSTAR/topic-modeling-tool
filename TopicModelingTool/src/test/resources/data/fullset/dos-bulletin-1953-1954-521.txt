dissimilarity of national origins. I am convinced
that for that reason—because it has overcome dis-
tance and difference of background—it is all the
stronger. Actually, Japanese and American civ-
ilization have much in common. The things to
which the Japanese devote themselves are those
that we ourselves take very seriously—whether
it is designing steel mills or cultivating ﬂower
ardens. We conceived an admiration for the
apanese long ago, when, starting with few as-
sets but their own character and intelligence, they
transformed their island home into one of the
most productive parts of the world. This kind
of success story, in which dili ence and applica-
tion prevail over adversity and all obstacles, has
alwa s had an irresistible appeal to the American
peo e—perhaps because it 1s their story too.
T is great lantern which comes to us as a sym-
bol of the traditions of Japan is as nearly im-
perishable in its construction as a product of
human hands can be. It was given to us by the
peoples of Tokyo, like the cherry trees around us
which have become to all our country symbolic
of the physical beauties of our National Ca ital.
It will always mean to us that the people of okyo
reciprocate the friendship we fee for them and
have chosen this poetic and endurin means of
assurino' that they stand beside us, no ess than we
beside them, in our common efforts to realize the
promise of our century, which contains so much
of darkness, so much of hope.
Hydrogen Bomb Tests
in the Paciﬁc
b1 Lewis L. Strauss
hairman, Atomic Energy Commission 1
The President has authorized me to make avail-
able those portions of my report of yesterday to
him, the publication of which would not compro-
mise information vital to our national security.
I have just returned from the Paciﬁc proving
ounds of the Atomic Ener Commission, where
witnessed the second art 0 a test series of ther-
monuclear weapons. will describe it as well as
I am able, but perhaps before doing so it would be
appropriate to begin with a short summary of the
historical background.
\Ve detected the test of an atomic weapon, or
device, by the Russians in August of 1949.2
Realizing that our leadership was therefore chal-
lenged and that our sole possession of the weapon
which had been a major deterrent to aggression
had been canceled, it became clear that our su eri-
ority would thereafter be only relative an de-
pendent upon a quantitative lead—that is to say,
upon our possession of greater numbers of atomic
weapons so long as that could be maintained.
There was, however, the alternative of a qualita-
tive lead if we could make a weapon of greater
force—greater than the ﬁssion weapons by a de-
gree of magnitude comparable to the difference be-
tween fission bombs and conventional bombs. A
theoretical method of accomplishing this was
known to our scientists.
In January 1950 the President directed the
Atomic Energy Commission to undertake the
necessary steps to see if this weapon, variously
called the hydrogen bomb, the fus10n bomb, and
the thermonuclear bomb, could in fact be made.
As you know, thanks to the ingenuity of those
scientists and engineers who devoted themselves
to the project, the feasibility of the fusion reaction
was demonstrated and a prototype was tested at
Eniwetok in November 1952.
This test produced the largest manmade e lo-
sion ever Witnessed to that date, and fromxtihat
point we moved into reﬁnement of design and
other development. In August of last year the
Russians also tested a weapon or device of a yield
well beyond the range of regular ﬁssion weapons
and which derived a part of its force from the
fusion of light elements.8 There is good reason to
believe that they had be n work on this weapon
substantially before we id.
The present series of tests has been long in the
lanning. It is conducted jointly by the Atomic
nergy Commission and the De artment of De-
fense. A Task Force composed o the three armed
services and a scientiﬁc staff representing the Com-
mission was established last ear in accordance
with the procedure successfu y followed in pre—
ceding tests outside our continental limits. The
Nav , Air Force, and Army have successively sup-
pli the command for the Task Forces.
Early this January, men and sup lies began to
move out to the roving grounds or this series.
The ﬁrst shot too place on its scheduled date of
March 1, and the second on March 26. Both were
successful. No test is made without a deﬁnite
urpose and a careful determination that it is
directed toward an end result of major importance
to our military strength and readiness. The re-
sults which the scientists at Los Alamos and Liver-
more had hoped to obtain from these two tests
were fully realized, and enormous potential has
been added to our military posture by what we
have learned.
It should also be noted that the testing of weap-
ons is important likewise in order to be fully aware
of the ossible future, aggressive ability of an
enemy, or we now fully know that we possess no
monopoly of capability in this awesome ﬁeld.
N ow as to this speciﬁc test series. The ﬁrst shot
has been variously described as “devastating,”
“out of control,” and with other exaggerated and
