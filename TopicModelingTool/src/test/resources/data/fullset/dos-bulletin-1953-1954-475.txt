Two-thirds of this total was a carefully selected
group of people from other countries who came
to the United States to study, to teach, to lecture
to carry on specialized research, or to gain actual
work experience.
They were young peo le, such as the de uty
chief of the Legislative fieference Service 0 the
Government of India, who this year completed
work on his Ph.D. in public administration at
American University. They were teachers, like
the director for a number of rural schools in Cuba,
who observed educational methods in our schools.
Another group included current leaders of
thought and opinion—newsmen, government ofﬁ-
cials, members of national legislative bodies, labor
and business leaders, and social workers. Be-
cause of duties back home, many of this latter
group stay in the United States only a brief
period, usually not more than 3 months.
The other third of the exchanges were Amer-
icans who went abroad to study, teach, lecture,
or do research. The represented all of our 48
States. Some are ho ding conferences on Amer-
ican studies or teaching English as a foreign lan-
guage to meet the rowing interest overseas in
American life. Ot ers are specialists, like the
Labor Commissioner of the State of Wyoming or
the Chief Justice of the State of Nebraska, who
are helping to correct many distorted conceptions
of American life, not only in professional and
academic circles but among workers in the fac-
tories, farms, and mines.
Many of these exchanges were planned within
the framework of projects to meet special situa-
tions in different countries. For example, in Korea
a group of American educators is helping Korean
teachers and school administrators to reestablish
prima and secondary schools with an up-to-date
curricu um. Groups of newsmen from NATO coun-
tries are seein our defense efforts at ﬁrsthand,
within the setting of our national life.
Efforts are made to keep the exchan e program
ﬂexible enough to meet other imme iate needs.
For example, shortly after the President’s pro-
posal to the United Nations on the peaceful uses
of atomic ener , the Department developed a
panel of top-ﬂig t experts who will be available
to lecture overseas on American uses of atomic
energy for peaceful and humane purposes.
In addition, 384 impressionable young people
in 12 countries were given scholarships to study in
American-sponsored schools overseas. These
institutions, like the American Farm School in
Greece and the American University of Beirut,
have long been recognized as a bulwark of Ameri-
can inﬂuence in the Near East.
Twenty-two American-sponsored schools in the
other American Republics were given small cash
grants, and 208 similar schools received profes-
sional guidance and other services to help them to
maintain American standards of teaching and
school administration. These schools, recently
praised so highly by Dr. Milton Eisenhower, have
educated over a mi lion Latin American children.
As the American Ambassador to Guatemala
pointed out they are “trainin a generation of
oung eople who will, throng their education,
ave ac iieved strong ties with and a basic under-
standing of the United States.”
The Department also helped 311 other exchange
pro'ects. Through these projects more than 1,886
exc anges were arranged which furthered the De-
artment’s objectives at no cost to the United
a tates Government.
Expenditures under the Smith-Mundt Act for
exchanges were relatively small, $8,011,043, con-
sidering the scope of the program. However,
without these funds the Department would have
been unable to make full use of ap roximately $8
million in private support or $9 million in foreign
currency available under the Fulbright Act.
RESULTS OF PROGRAM
It must be assumed that the full results of ex-
change ex erience are a matter of cumulative im-
pact. Al exchanges also have an immediate
result. There was, for example, the Japanese
legislator who told his countrymen:
I realized from this trip that the essential diﬂerence and
disagreement between Communist Russia and the United
States is that the former represents a way of life by
compulsion and the latter a way of life which is based on
and derives its strength from voluntary processes. The
American way is just and proper for human society.
Or as a European specialist put it:
I had always been afraid of Russian imperialism. Not
however until I visited your country did I learn to believe
in the United States as a supporter of all the good and
culture-supporting ideas. If you invite people from other
countries to visit the U.S.A., you can make your passive
friend your active ally.
Such examples are almost endless. In Co en-
hagen a returned Danish teacher, Otto Brein olt,
is conducting evening classes for adults entitled
“U.S.A., Community and People” and “Aspects
of Life Expressed in American Literature.’
A Latin American newspaper editor wrote over
80 feature stories, highly favorable, about his expe-
rience in the United States. They were given
front page space and followed up by a lecture
tour.
Thorarinn Thorarinsson, editor of a daily paper
in Iceland, has launched a one-man campaign to
explain the necessity for American troops in Ice-
land. He reminds his readers that as early as
1920 Lenin had noted the importance of Iceland
in time of war. He has stated, “All Communist
actions indicate that they intend to conquer the
world and dominate it.” He refuted charges of
“imperialism” in the United States. He to (1 his
countrymen that, by not cooperating in the build—
