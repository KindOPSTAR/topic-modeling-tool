1953 was only $94.6 million, or little more than
the $91 million of the previous year. And the
Communists slashed their buying of Pakistan cot-
ton, which had come to about $84 million in 1952,
down to about $7 million in 1953.
They Play by Their Own Rules
Clearly the glittering prospect of a. vast and
lucrative trade with the Chinese Communists
which had captured the imagination of many
Western traders was not materializing.
The China Association, a British trade organi-
zation, said in December: “There is no doubt but
that the potentialities have been greatly exag-
gerated in the public mind, partly as a result of the
superﬁcial successes of the various unofﬁcial trade
missions which have paid visits to Peking this year.
This overeagerness has unfortunately been re-
ﬂected in an increasing severity of the terms which
China now demands.’
Information about the increasing severity of the
trade requirements which Communist China was
trying to impose upon the free world came from
all sides in the last half of 1953. Those terms
would hardly suggest a genuine interest in normal
and expanding trade relations.
When the Chinese Communists sell, they de-
mand a conﬁrmed letter of credit in the hands of
their own bank before they will ship the goods.
They collect payment as soon as they have loaded
the goods on a ship. They resent a Communist
Chinese Government certi cate of inspection
against which the buyer has no recourse if he
ﬁnds—weeks or months later—that the quality of
the goods is below speciﬁcation.
One who sells to Communist China is asked to
follow a very different set of rules. He ships his
goods and waits until they have arrived in Com—
munist China, have been inspected by Communist
Chinese Government inspectors, and are in the
hands of the buyers, before he can collect his
money. In the meantime he extends credit with-
out interest, immobilizimr the capital he had in-
vested in the cargo, freight, and insurance, and is
forced to accept claims resulting from inspection
of his goods in Communist China.
No doubt exce tions to these rules are still being
granted to some estern traders, for the rules are
so remote from long-recognized international
trading practices that many ﬁrms would naturally
balk at them. But there is no doubt that the un-
conventional and frustrating practices of the Chi-
nese Communists have interfered seriously with
the amount of commerce and have disillusioned
many who saw an almost unlimited market in
China’s multitudes.
United States Policy on the China Trade
As mentioned before, the plolicy of the United
States throughout the 6 mont s under review was
to continue its total embargo on all exports-—
strategic or nonstrategic—to Communist China
and North Korea, which were aggressors, and
labeled as such by the United Nations. Rumors
heard from time to time in various countries, to
the effect that the United States had decided to
relax its embargo or was under irresistible pres-
sure to do so, and that American cars were reach-
ing the Chinese mainland by way of Japan, were
completely untrue.
The position of the United States throughout
the reVIew period was also that the free-world
embargo on strategic goods to Communist China—
an embargo much more sweeping than that apply-
in to the European bloc—should be maintained.
Ot er free overnments took the same osition,
and the em argo continued in force. 'uch re-
laxations as took place in controls were changes
that did not affect the multilateral embargo. One
example was the change in the control of anti-
biotics and sulfonamldes. The nations which
carry on trade with Communist China had been
controllin those drugs, while hostilities continued
in Koreafliy limiting the quantities shipped; the
quotas assumed by the various nations were sched-
uled to expire on December 31, 1953, and were
permitted to expire on schedule. Another example
was the relaxation by Japan on certain items that
had been under embargo by that country—but
these were items that the other countries were not
embargoing. The same was true of the United
Kingdom’s decision to permit the shipment of light
passenger automobiles.
Though the policies of other major free gov-
ernments regarding trade with Communist China
have not been identical with our own, the United
States has not attempted—and will not attempt—
to bring about conformity through coercion.
This is true of all of our relations with other
countries, not merely our relations with them on
the issue of Communist China.
Leaders of this Government forcefully res
aﬁirmed that principle during the period we are
reviewing.
Secretary of State John Foster Dulles said in a
statement on December 1 : ‘
The tide of events has made our Nation more power-
ful, but I believe that it should not make us less loyal
to our great American traditions and that it should not
blur our dedication to the truths, expressed in our
Declaration of Independence, that we owe a respect to
the opinions of others.
Today it is to our interest to assist certain countries.
But that does not give us the right to try to take them
over, to dictate their trade policies, and to make them
our satellites.
Indeed, we do not want weak or subservient allies.
Our friends and allies are dependable just because they
are unwilling to be anyone’s satellites. They will
freely sacriﬁce much in a common eﬂort. But they will
no more be subservient to the United States than they
will be subservient to Soviet Russia.
