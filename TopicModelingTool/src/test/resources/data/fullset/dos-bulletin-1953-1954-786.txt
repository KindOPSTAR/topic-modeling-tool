Advancing U.S. Economic Policies Through the United Nations
by David McK. Key
Assistant Secretary for United Nations Aﬁaz'ra ‘
I would like to discuss with you tonight certain
international aspects of American economic
pplicy— articularly, how our participation in the
nited ations helps us in our economic and
trade relations with other countries. This is a
ﬁtting place in which to do so because Miami is
one of the vital crossroads in our far-ﬂung eco-
nomic relations with other countries. For ex-
am 1e, our huge trade with Latin America—
which in 1953 took ﬁrst place over Canada—is
symbolized by the )rojection of the Florida enin-
sula into the Cari bean as a bridge and c annel
for commerce in the Western Hemisphere.
Let me sa at the outset that c ' delegates in
the United ations do not 0 erate, as do the repre-
sentatives of the Soviet b 00, on the basis of a
rigid “party line” unrelated to the ublic interest.
Our representatives attem t to reiibct accurately
the interest and desires o the American people
and to concert them with those of friendly powers
whose support and cooperation are essential.
In this connection, our representatives in the
United Nations have received real assistance in
promoting the interests of the American commu-
nity from the United States Chamber of Com-
merce. The sup ort of your national organiza-
tion for the broad) objectives of the U.N. has been
clearly demonstrated. I was glad to note that at
its recent 42d annual meeting in Washington, the
Chamber of Commerce ado ted resolutions which
stated that “the United ations ﬁlls an indis-
pensable function in today’s world”; which sup-
ported the designation of October 24 of each ear
as United Nations Day; and which supporte the
purposes of UNESCO, one of the speciallzed agen-
cies of the United Nations. These and prev1ous
evidences of support were, I know, not 'ven
lightly or merely as a gesture of good will. hey
were the result of hard study and the practical
experience of the representatives of the Chamber
of Commerce.
‘ Address made before the Miami Chamber of Commerce,
Miami, Fla., on May 13 (press release 247 dated May 12).
This sup ort is most welcome to public oﬁicials
like myselfp who are responsible to the taxpayers
for their investment in the United Nations. It is
also evidence that the Chamber of Commerce, to-
gether with a number of other responsible private
American bodies, is prepared to make its inﬂuence
felt in the councils of the United Nations. Paren-
thetically, let me pa personal tribute to Dr. Earl
Cruickshank, who ibr many years has been the
Chamber of Commerce observer at the United Na-
tions and who has followed keenly developments
there of interest to the Chamber. I can attest
to Dr. Cruickshank’s thoroughness and initiative
because he has worked closely with our ofﬁcials
both in New York and Washington. He is a great
credit to the Chamber.
I think that it is signiﬁcant that both the United
States Chamber and the International Junior
Chamber of Commerce were granted consultative
status with the Economic and Social Council
(commonly called Ecosoc) at its last session. This
means that from now on Chamber representatives
may appear and speak at Ecosoc sessions on mat-
ters of concern to the American business commu-
nity. The International Chamber of Commerce
has enjoyed consultative status with the Council
for some years, as have the National Association
of Manufacturers and the Inter-American Council
of Commerce and Production. Through these or-
ganizations, businessmen here and abroad can
make their views heard and their inﬂuence felt in
all the economic activities of the United Nations.
They can also help us present to the world an accu-
rate picture of the American way of life.
This is especially important with respect to
Eoosoc, which is responsible for making recom-
mendations to the members of the United Nations
and for coordinating the activities of the special-
ized agencies. One of its most important func-
tions is to review each year the world economic
conditions and to seek majority agreement on
measures to remedy existing problems. In this
annual consideration of current developments in
