makes all forms of association and cooperation
easier and more necessary.
Now let us look briefly at the relationships of
trade and commerce. Again private enterprise
is responsible, and no daily relationships with
Latin America are more im ortant. President
Eisenhower has declared that ‘ Our whole economy
turns and depends upon the commerce of the
world.” Thousands of businessmen in Latin
America and the United States engage in a trade
which totaled over $7 billion last year. Our im-
ports alone, from Latin America, have increased
six times in dollar value since 1939—and they are
one-third of all United States imports. Imports
from Europe have risen in value three times in
the same period, but emergency economic aid was
r uired to revive economic activity after the war.
see no reason why our trade with Latin Amer-
ica should not ex and until it matches our huge
trade with Cana a. On a per capita basis, that
would bring our trade with atin America to $70
billion a ear.
One re entless factor which will increase trade
is our growing need for minerals and other raw
materials. A recent commission of experts came
up with the stern report that already we import 10
percent of all the minerals we consume. In 20
years they estimated the amount will be almost
certainly 20 percent. During World War II,
Latin America was already our most important
foreign source of supply for 20 different strategic
materials, including petroleum, copper, and lead.
Think of the extent to which we would depend
upon friendly collaboration with neighboring
countries in the event of another catastrophe.
And we must not forget that our wide export trade
is dependent upon a stable market in our own
country for foreign products. We must buy to be
able to sell.
Prlvete Investment
Perhaps the greatest challenge of all to private
enterprise in Latin America today is in the ﬁeld
of private investment~ Some of the Latin Ameri-
can countries are now aware that private invest-
ment has been the Aladdin’s lamp which has
magicall raised living standards in the United
States. They are discovering that this lamp need
only be rubbed in the right way to create miracles
for their own countries—toward fulﬁllment of
their economic aspirations. Only a small amount
of encouragement has resulted in the movement
of over $2 billion in new investment from the
United States to Latin America since World War
II. And American investors now have $6 billion
in Latin America, more than 30 rcent of all
United States private investment a road. At the
same time, 95 percent of all new investment in
Latin America since the war has been of local
ca ital.
en Dr. Milton Eisenhower, the President’s
brother, re rted on his recent mission to South
America,2 e expressed his view that private ca -
ital primarily must be depended on to develo tlie
reat economic potentials of the nations in tin
merica. But he said, “Here we met a great
inconsistency: While some condemn foreign in-
vestment as an actual or otential evil and while
some adopt practices and e islation that frighten
or make almost im ossible e entrance of foreign
capital, all strong y insist that a reater volume
of public and private capital from a road is needed
if the are to meet their 'ust aspirations.” Dr.
Eisen ower summed up t ie situation by saying
that “A enuine belief in the value to the com-
munity 0 private competitive enterprise and pri-
vate proﬁt is rhaps the most fundamental
requirement” in Ilflitin American economic devel-
opment.
Here indeed is a challen e for us. How can we
most effectively persuade tin Americans that
private capital has become the servant of the com-
munity in our countryl How can we dissipate the
idea of “Wall Street Im rialism” as pictured in
Communist propaganda?e The Communists are
intensely active in propaganda to discourage in-
vestment and commerce. They fear economic
improvement and rising living standards which
would deflate their arguments. I believe the great-
est Communist danger to Latin America so far is
their success in delaying economic development.
We should be able to demonstrate that produc-
tivity in our own country has been largely due to
private enterprise—and that this is therefore the
great asset our country has to offer to other coun-
tries. And it is important that we do this be-
cause, in the long run, economic health and
strength that come from productivity in friendly
countries are vital to world ce.
To meet this challenge, periliedlps we could make
better use of the startling facts in recent reports
on the United States ewnomy. Last year, for
example, our factories produced 500 million pairs
of shoes, and our people spent $230 billion in retail
stores. Total personal income for all the people
of the United States was $285 billion. In contrast,
however, dividends paid out by all corporations
in the United States to all their owners in 1953
were less than $10 billion. Foreigners who fear
the supposed imperialistic monopolies—the cor-
porations and banks—should be reassured to know
that less than 4 percent of the national income
went to the owners of these institutions. Those
who think that the ownership of corporations is
concentth in the hands of a few people should
likewise be reassured to know that one family in
every ten in the United States owns some shares
in corporations—5 million families out of the 50
million families in our country. Incidentally,
half the individual shareholders are women. To
show the even wider distribution of income among
