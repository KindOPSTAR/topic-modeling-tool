The Challenge for Private Enterprise in Latin America
by Robert F. Woodward
Deputy Assistant Secretary for Inter-American A ﬂair-s 1
Anyone who works on relations with Latin
America is not likely to underestimate the power
of a woman. In 1928 the women of the American
Republics organized the Inter-American Com-
mission of Women. The objectives of this Com-
mission were not unlike those of your great League
of Women Voters. In that year, 1928, not one of
the Latin American countrles yet gave the vote
to women. Today, 14 of those countries have
complete women’s suﬂ'rage. In three other coun-
tries women can vote in municipal elections. And
that leaves only three countries in which women
do not yet vote at all.
Women, throu h the ages, have had the reputa-
tion of singular oresight, the ability to look into
the future and seek a goal, an ideal, without being
distracted by the problems and obstacles of today.
As we talk about atin America, I hope that your
foresight will conﬁrm my own conviction that we
are on the threshold of a vastly expandin rela-
tionship with the countries of the estern
Hemisphere—that we can look forward to a great
new era of fruitful partnership.
The people of the 20 countries of Latin America
number 160 million, about the same as our own
country. But the population of Latin America
has doubled in 40 years. And it is now expanding
at a rate more rapid than an other part of the
world. When our population in the United States
reaches 200 million, which may be less than 25
years from now, the population of Latin America
will already far outnumber our own. This great
number of people—their economic health, their
productivity, and their state of mind—are of
momentous and ever-increasing signiﬁcance to our
security and well-being.
Fortunately, we already have unique and strong
relations with Latin America. The Organization
of American States and the Rio Treaty of Re-
ciprocal Assistance come to mind immediately.

But the fact I wish to emphasize is that private
citizens carry on directly the reat volume of
United States relations with atin America.
These private relations are conducted on such a
large scale and in such variety that the govern-
ment servant must constantly strive to keep in
perspective his own efforts to encourage to con-
ciliate, or coordinate. Once you are fully aware
of the scope of private enter rise in our relations
with the other countries 0 this hemisphere, I
believe you will be impressed with the responsi-
bility of the citizen—the challenge to the citizen—-
to represent the United States in his own conduct
and character and to move ahead to further
achievement.
Let us examine one striking example of these
relations, the example of air travel. This has
revolutionized personal relationships in this hemi-
sphere. Toda , 75 ercent of all people traveling
between the nite States and Latin America
travel by airplane—a much higher percenta e
than 1n any other comparable part of the wor (1.
Look at the short span of ears in which this has
come about. In 1919 the rst commercial airline
in the Western Hemisphere began to carry passen-
gers—in Colombia—before passengers were car-
ried in the United States. Today there are 50
airlines in Latin America alone, and last year
their 700 airplanes traveled a distance more than
3,000 times around the world at the Equator. The
19 airlines traveling between Latin America and
the United States carried over 700,000 passengers.
Twenty-ﬁve years ago it took 18 days to travel
from New York to Buenos Aires. Now, any day
in the week, you can do this easily in 30 hours or
less. While Government has given much assist-
ance to the airlines, this rogress would never have
come about had it not een for the enterprise of
a large number of private citizens in Latin Amer-
ica and the United States.
None of us wants to glorify speed for itself.
But when eople are brought 18 times closer to-
gether, at geast in terms of travel time, this is
bound to be important in all relationships. It
