tries of the world by the United States Government
has no parallel in the history of the world, either
in essence or in quantity. I am convinced the sig-
niﬁcance of your action will be recorded in history
as the most important event of the post \Vorld
War II period.
The beneﬁts and the material importance of the
program are many but I believe the most striking
and admirable feature of it is the new world con-
ce t of international morality.
Iy country has utilized this assistance to the
utmost by combining it with the means at its dis-
posal. Your aid has been used entirely in the
effort to resist the destructive forces which
threaten our civilization. I can assert without
equivocation that Turkey has been at least one of
the recipients who put your aid to the best pos-
sible use.
In these days of turbulence and danger, Turkey
occupies an extensive area on the ramparts of
the peace front. From every point of view it pre-
sents a position of vital importance to our common
cause.
The Republic of Turkey possesses all the requi-
sites of a strong and stable structure from a politi-
cal and social point of view. It has also achieved
a record for speedy economic development.
We possess a military establishment whose im-
portance cannot be denied. Our moral strength
as a nation is inﬂexible.
With these attributes and qualiﬁcations, Turkey
is developin day to day as an even more important
military an economic force for our common peace
front. It is our constant duty to increase our ma-
terial and moral efforts to enable our military pro-
gram to match our swift economic development.
American military aid has made it possible to
equip our forces with modern weapons and to train
the troops in their use. Your economic aid has
constituted a valuable factor in supporting our
efforts to strengthen our economic structure so
that we may maintain a strong army.
The Need tor Strength and Unity
The tremendous technical rogress of this cen-
tury has had the effect of swrtening distances,
which makes the world seem smaller. Today, dis-
tant and separate parts of the world have been
brought together. The political concept of sepa-
ration of continents has become obsolete. Accord-
ingly, a danger which confronts one country, no
matter where located, is a danger which confronts
our whole world.
That being the case, the slightest hesitation to
act or the slightest weakness of will power can
bring catastrophe to the peace-loving community.
For this reason, it is imperative that all nations
dedicated to peace be morally and materially
strong and united.
It is because my country, in whose behalf I have
the honor to speak here today, knows these facts
very well that she is so fervently attached to the
princi le of collective security u on which the free
world as so completely put its aith.
When an unjust aggression, kindled by the false
belief that the United Nations would neither act
nor intervene, occurred in Korea, Turkey did not
hesitate for a single moment to join those countries
which showed the fortitude to send their sons to
farawa battleﬁelds.
The (levotion of my country to the ideals of man-
kind and to peace are not conﬁned to the pursuit
of a steadfast and resolute policy within the
United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, excellent as those bodies are as a
means of maintaining peace.
It would be equally ap ropriate to stress in this
connection that in accor ance with principles set
forth in the charter of the United Nations, Turkey
has sought to ﬁll in the gaps existing in the peace
front. The Tripartite Balkan Pact which was
sxirgned last year between Greece, Turkey, and
ugoslavia is clear evidence of how strong bar-
riers can be set up by realistic and resolute states
united in a sincere desire for eace. This pact has
simultaneously set a new and ﬁne example in the
application of the rights and principles of self-
defense for the preservation of peace as recognized
by the charter of the United Nations and con-
tributed to its consolidation.
Reletlons Wlth Greece and Yugoslevle
I would like in this connection to refer to Greek-
Turkish relations. The friendship established
between Greece and Turkey is the best example
of how two countries who mistakenly mistrusted
each other for centuries have agreed upon a close
and loyal collaboration as a result of recognition
of the realities of life.
My country is truly proud of its ties, within the
framework of the Tripartite Balkan Pact, with
Yu oslavia, who valiantly safeguarded her honor
an independence after a bitter and dangerous
ordeal, and with Greece with whom our friendly
relations have become fraternal.
As you can see, Turkey is doin her utmost
within the peace front to fulﬁll t e duties in-
cumbent upon her. The Turkish Nation, faced
with a danger common to us all, remains upright,
steadfastly holding to her material and moral
forces at one of the most critical spots in the world.
I would like to express to you the hope that
the sacriﬁces incurred for the sake of common
ideals ma be rewarded by the long-expected
eace in e Far East. However, should peace
e signed, the United Nations resolution about
Korea should remain in full force. The security
of the future depends on this fact. Korea is an
example. This example may be repeated any-
where in the world. New ﬁres may break out.
The duty of the free and peace-loving nations is
