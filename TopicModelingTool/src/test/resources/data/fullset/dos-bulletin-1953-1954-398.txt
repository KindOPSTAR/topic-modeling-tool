Following is the text of a statement made b
Secretary Dulles at Caracas, Venezuela, on M are
6, immediately after a plenary session of the
Tenth Inter-American Conference, together with
statements made by Mr. Dulles duri the March

STATEMENT OF MARCH 5
The Guatemalan Forei Minister [Guillermo
Toriello] has made clear t at he opposes any dec-
laration by this Conference inst international
communism. Not only does e oppose any new
action but also he oes further and says that his
Government consi ers invalid prior resolutions
for which his Government voted at the Ninth In-
ter-American Conference in 1948 and at the
fourth meeting of American Foreign Ministers in
1951. By these resolutions the American States
unanimously condemned international commu-
nism as incompatible with the concept of Ameri—
can freedom and as a danger for the American
States.
We do not intend to let this issue be obscured
by an abusive attack made upon the United States.
We deplore the fact that this inter-American
meeting should be used as a platform for efforts
which seek to defame other American States and
to exploit every possible difference with a view
to disrupting t e harmony of our gathering.
Guatemala s position With respect to interven-
tion of international communism in the American
Republics will be put to the test when this agenda
item is taken 11 .
\Ve are con dent this Conference will reafﬁrm
the position of the Ninth Conference on this ques-
tion and will 0 on to declare that domination and
control of po itical institutions of any American
State by the international Communist movement
would constitute intervention by a. foreign politi-
cal power and be a threat to the peace of America.
STATEMENT OF MARCH 8
Press release 121 dated March 8
The United States has introduced a resolution
under the agenda item “Intervention of Interna-
tional Communism in the American Republics.”
Our proposal is before you.
Its preamble ﬁrst recalls the prior resolutions
ﬁndin international communism to be a threat
and t en records our judgment that this threat
still persists.
The ﬁrst operative portion declares that, if the
international Communist movement should come
to dominate the political institutions of any Amer-
ican State, that would be a threat to the sover-
eignty and litical independence of us all,
endangering t e peace of America and calling for
ap ropriate action.
11 accordance with existing treaties, the second
operative portion calls for disclosures and ex-
c anges of information, which would expose and
weaken the Communist conspiracy.
What is international communism? In the
course of the general debate, one of the Foreign
Ministers (the Minister of Guatemala) asked,
“What is international communism?” I thought
that by now every Foreign Minister of the world
knew what international communism is. It is dis-
turbing if the foreign aifairs of one of our Ameri-
can Republics are conducted by one so innocent
that he has to ask that question.
But since the question has been asked, it shall be
answered. International communism is that far-
ﬁung clandestine political organization which is
o erated by the leaders of the Communist Party
0 the Sov1et Union. Since 1939, it has brought
15 once independent nations into a state of abJect
servitude. It has a hard core of agents in rac-
tically every country of the world. The tota con-
stitutes not a theory, not a doctrine, but an aggres-
sive, tough, political force, backed by great re-
sources, and serving the most ruthless empire of
modern times.
