North Korea. Elsewhere the Commission func-
tioned as the United Nations had intended.
In December 1948 the United Nations General
Assembly received the report of its Temporary
Commission and adopted, by a vote of 48 to 6,
with 1 abstention, a resolution declaring:
That there has been established a lawful government
(the Government of the Republic of Korea) having effec-
tive control and jurisdiction over that part of Korea where
the Temporary Commission was able to observe and con'
suit and in which the great majority of the people of all
Korea reside; that this Government is based on elections
which were a valid expression of the tree will of the
electorate of that part of Korea and which were ob-
served by the Temporary Commission; and that this is
the only such Government in Korea.
The United States, trusting to the moral authority
of the United Nations and the charter undertak-
ings of its members, withdrew its own armed
forces from South Korea. That left South Korea
with only local forces suitable for maintenance
of internal order. In contrast, the Soviet Union
rapidly built up the war power of the Communist
regime it had installed in North Korea. On June
25, 1950, these forces launched a full-scale attack,
implemented with many Russian-made tanks and
anes.
The United Nations Temporary Commission,
which was present on the spot and the membership
of which 1ncluded India, instantly and unam-
mously found that this was armed aggression and
so re orted to the United Nations Security Coun-
cil. hat Council in turn, by a vote of 9 to 0,
with 1 absence and 1 abstention, certiﬁed to the
fact of aggression and called on the members of
the United Nations to hel to resist the aggression.
Sixteen nations responded with military contribu-
tions, and over 40 responded with either military
or material aid.
Aggressor: Routed
The small and lightly armed forces of the
Republic of Korea were initially overpowered by
the assault. The Communist aggressors quickly
occu ied all of Korea except a small beachhead
at usan. But the forces of the Republic of
Korea quickly rallied; the United Nations mem-
bers gave increasing support. A brilliant mili-
tary operation, invol’ving a bold landing at Inchon,
caught the aggressors off balance and enabled the
United Nations Command to break out of the
Pusan beachhead. The aggressors were routed
and destroyed as an effective force.
It seemed that the United Nations could now
com lete its earlier action to uni Korea. Ac-
cor ingly, on October 7, 1950, the eneral Assem-
bly set up a new body, known as the United
Nations Commission for the Uniﬁcation and Reha-
bilitation of Korea (UNCURK), to complete the
task of the previous commissions. The new
Commission proceeded to Korea.
But the long-sought uniﬁcation and freedom of
Korea was not yet to be. Another Communist
aggression intervened. In November 1950 the
Communist Chinese regime sent masses of its
armed forces into northern Korea. The United
Nations General Assembly by a vote of 44 to 7,
with 9 abstentions, adjudged this intervention to
be aggression.
The United Nations Command was forced to
withdraw again to the south of Korea. But
again they fou ht their way back to a point where
the aggressors eld less territory than when they
had committed the initial aggression from the
38th parallel.
On Jul 27, 1953, an armistice was concluded
with the United Nations Command. This was no
free-will gift of peace by the Communists. It
came only after fanatical efforts to break the line
of the United Nations Command had failed with
ghastly losses to the attackers. And it came
only after the Communists realized that, unless
there was a quick armistice, the battle area would
be enlarged so as to endanger the sources of ag res-
sion in Manchuria. Then and only then d1 the
Communist rulers judge that it would be expe-
dient to sign the armistice.
The armistice contemplated that there should
be a Political Conference with reference to Korea
within 3 months. But the Communists found it
inexpedient to live up to that agreed recommenda-
tion. They desired ﬁrst to consolidate their posi-
tion in North Korea.
Only now does the Korean Political Conference
meet, after long hagglin over the composition
and place of meeting. T e composition and the
place of the Conference are precisely those which
the United Nations side proposed 6 months ago.
This fact enables one to judge where lies the
responsibility for the delay.
The 7 -year story I have summarized is a story
of persistent attack against the forces of inter-
national law and order represented by the United
Nations. \Vhether this attack will still prevail
may be determined by this Conference.
During the same 7- ear period of 1947 to date
the Governments of rance, Great Britain, and
the United States have been working with the
Soviet Union to bring about a uniﬁcation of Ger-
man and liberation of Austria. There have been
hnn reds of meetings of the Foreign Ministers or
their aides on these subjects. Nothing has been
accom lished. But something has been learned.
This onference can usefully have that in mind
as we judge the proposals which come before us
here.
Communist Fear of Freedom
Soviet Communist conduct seems to have been
largely inﬂuenced by fear of freedom.
The Communist ruling class believes that a so-
ciety is most peaceful and most productive if its
