Statement by Secretary Dulles 1
Mr. Chairman and honorable delegates, I welcome
this opportunity of addressing the Intergovern-
mental Committee for European Migration. Your
work is of intense interest to the United States, an
interest which is proved by the presence of our
United States legislators here, particularly Con-
gressman Reed and Congressman Walters, at so
many of your sessions.
I have come here merely to conﬁrm, if any con-
ﬁrmation is needed. the interest which the United
States takes and which has already been so fully
shown.
Your Committee, by reason of its structurekthe
evidence of which is here about us, is well ﬁtted to
work out the solution of the urgent problems of
excess populations and of their productive resettle-
ment. You are the only intergovernmental organi-
zation which, if adequately supported by its mem-
bers, can actually solve some of those difﬁcult
problems.
There are many facts which show that your
organization is dealing successfully with its prob
lems. I may mention only a few. I note that the
number of member governments has increased, so
that there are now 24. I note the fact that those
member governments have determined to establish
this Committee on a more permanent basis through
the adoption of a constitution.
Already, I understand, your Committee is re-
sponsible for assisting the movement of one-third
of the yearly total number of migrants from conti-
nental Europe. The scope of your work is now being
extended and your activities are being broadened.
All of this represents solid progress and conﬁrms
the farsighted intentions of your founders.
I alluded a moment ago to the interest which the
United States Government has taken in this work.
That interest derives from many factors. We know
that the growth of exeess populations creates un-
employment with all its disturbing implications.
The problems with which you are dealing are not
unrelated to the defense and the security of the
entire free world.
All of this is of course of very direct interest to
the United States. Also, I may add, the humani-
tarian character of your task has a strong appeal.
The American people have always had a very deep
sympathy with whatever alleviates the sufferings
of mankind. These are a few of the many considera—
tions which justify continued United States support
of this organization.
I may add that it is encouraging to know that
this compact and active organization, with its clear-
cut agenda, is in fact able to reach constructive
decisions on its vital tasks. I hope the same may
prove true of the other Conference which I am
attending which goes on in this same building.
What you are doing here is proof that the free
governments can effectively join together in the
solution of great human problems. In this troubled
world where so many suffer and where so much
suspicion reigns, your Committee’s work stands out
as a welcome shining light.
‘Made before the Intergovernmental Committee
for European Migration at Geneva, Switzerland,
on Apr. 30.


stituted one-third of the total annual migration
from Europe and stated that he looked forward
conﬁdently to an annual movement under the
Committee’s aus ices of 250,000. This target
would present a c allenge to the government mem-
bers to make sufﬁcient resources available to the
Committee to permit full exploitation of the op-
ortunities for migration presently envisaged.
he Committee found practical application of
Mr. Gibson’s observations in its later consideration
of the program proposed for 1955, which en-
v1saged the movement of 156,700 under a total
budget of $50,035,675.
Mr. Gibson urged the governments also to give
early conSIderation to acceptance of the constitu-
tion prpfosed for the Committee at its sixth ses-
81011. e reported that eight governments—
Australia, Canada, Denmark, Israel, Italy, the
Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland—had al-
ready notiﬁed the Committee of their acceptance
of the constitution, which will give the Commit-
tee a more formal status and an anticipated life
span of at least 3 years from the date of entry into
force. Acceptances by 16 governments are re-
quired with other conditions to bring the con-
stitution into force.
The response to the Director’s statement was
sympathetic although, as might be expected, many
government representatives stated that no ﬁnan-
cial commitments with respect to future ears
could be made at that time. For the nited
States, Chauncey W. Reed, Francis E. Walter,
and Mrs. Dorothy D. Houghton, alternate U. S.
representatives, assured the Committee of continu-
ing United States interest and sup ort. Mr. Reed
stated that the question of United) States partici-
pation 1n the Committee in accordance with the
constitution adopted at the previous session at
Venice was currently under consideration by the
Congress and predicted early favorable action.
Mr. Walter spoke of the lively interest in the Com-
mlttee 1n the U. S. Congress, and Mrs. Houghton
presented a summary statement of the activities
of the United States Escapee Program and cited
the close collaboration existing between the pro-
gram and the Committee as a practical demonstra-
tion of United States support of the Committee’s
eﬂ’orts. Approximately 10,000 recent escapees
from Communist areas had been assisted in re-
settlement by the joint action of the Committee
and the Escapee Program.
In attendance at the meetin of April 30 were
Richard Casey, Minister of tate for External
Affairs, Australia; John Foster Dulles, Secretary
of State, United States of America; Paul-Henri
Spaak, Minister of Foreign Aﬂ'airs, Belgium; and
Adrian Pelt, Director, European Oiiice of the
United Nations. Mr. Casey and Mr. Dulles ad-
dressed the Committee brieﬂy, conﬁrmed the inter-
est of their respective governments in its work,
and commended the Committee for its eﬂ'orts to
ﬁnd solutions for a great human problem.
