November 1950.8 This is the broad response of
the United Nations to Soviet vetoes and obstruc-
tionism which have prevented the Security Coun-
cil from exercising its primary responsibility of
the maintenance of international peace and secu-
rity. Now the General Assembly can meet in
emergency session and recommend collective
measures, including the use of force, to members
in the event the Security Council is unable to act.
The fact that one organ is paralyzed means that
other United Nations organs have had to assume
greater functions. The iarm done by the abuse
of the veto in the Security Council has led to the
compensatincr activity of the General Assembly
through the ‘Uniting for Peace” mechanism.
lelts of Charter Revlew
If the charter review problem is essentially po-
litical, it is the greater part of wisdom that at
the outset we place certain limitations on the
kinds of amendments we may seek. For our part,
we feel that extreme pro osals should be avoided.
We do not intend that t e review conference de-
stro U.N. functions and assets as they now exist.
T us, to map the problem of charter review, I
believe that an agreed scale, with agreed dimen-
sions and boundaries, is necessary, so that an
agreed course can be charted. The Departinent
has done this to focus and direct its own thinking.
There are a number of theoretically possible
extremes which we in the State Department have
already ruled out in our own approach to this
problem. These extremes would include such
thin as trying to write a brand new charter.
We eel this would open a Pandora’s box, making
it difﬁcult, if not impossible, to reassemble any-
thing like the present United Nations. As Score-
tary Dulles said, “The United Nations as it is, 18
better than no United Nations at all.” ‘
The map with which we are working, and on
which we are trying to chart a reasonable course,
also has on its extreme limits proposals to estab-
lish some sort of superstate; to ex el those we
do not like; and to withdraw Unite States par-
tici ation.
0 far as a “superstate” is concerned, I would
remind you that we must work with the material
at hand, with the world as it is. We live in a
world of sovereign nations and we are working
mightily to develo a level of cooperation amon
them which wouldegin to make ossible the fu -
ﬁllment of the commitments embo ied in the pres-
ent charter.
Obviously, a voluntary association of states is
not adequate in itself to give us a binding guar-
antee that there will be no war. But the United
Nations as a voluntary association does afford to
all peace-loving states a reasonable assurance that
they will have friends and allies if they are wan~

tonly attacked by an aggressor. It also works in
many ways to prevent wars before they can start.
President Eisenhower has called it a “sheer neces-
sity” and has said that it is “man’s best organized
hope to substitute the conference table for the
battlefield.” 5 The charter review conference
must not hamper these vital aspects of United Na-
tions activity. We do not believe that it could
proﬁtably devote itself to the attempt to create a
superstate.
Neither do we believe that proposals to reor-
anize the United Nations Without the Soviet
nion are within the proper scope of the review
conference. There is the practical difﬁculty that,
while article 5 and 6 permit suspension and ex-
pulsion, such action would require agreement of
the Security Council, which in turn is subject to
the veto. There is the further consideration that,
as Secretary Dulles has said, “most of the mem-
bers of the United Nations feel that it is better
to have even discordant members in the organiza-
tion . . .”' I would add that, while there is no
doubt that the Soviet bloc has consistently ﬂouted
the principles of the charter, the advantage in hav-
ing them within the United Nations is that they
are forced to lay bare their record of hypocrisy
before the bar of world opinion. The articles of
the charter provide us with a standard for judg-
ment of Soviet performance. That the United
States and the free world are winning the battle
of ideas within the forum of the United Nations
is demonstrated by the fact that the United Na-
tions has failed to ado t a single major Soviet
proposal to which we 0 jected during its entire
istory. As Ambassador Lodge puts it, the Rus-
sians cannot control the United Nations; they can-
not break it up; they do not dare leave it.
Without the Soviets, the United Nations’
chance of serving as a channel for East-West nego-
tiations, as in the ending of the Berlinblockade,
would be gone. Of most serious concern is that
if they were to be ousted from the United Nations,
it is possible that the organization might break up.
Finally, in spite of our abhorrence of Soviet
policies or the obvious shortcomings of the United
Nations, we do not look to the charter review con-
ference as a vehicle for our own withdrawal.
There is no country which has more to gain from
the successful functioning of the United Nations
than does the United States. The United Na-
tions cannot do as we would wish it to do in every
instance. If the United Nations is a mirror which
often reﬂects disturbing realities of our world,
the solution is not to smash the mirror. If the
United Nations is also, as Ambassador Lodge sug-
gests, a loudspeaker, we do not attack the loud-
speaker, we use it. Our withdrawal would mean
handing the Soviet Union a golden opportunity to
