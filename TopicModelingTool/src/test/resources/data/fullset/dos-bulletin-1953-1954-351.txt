the people of that country, the agreements being
si ed in exchanges of October 14-21, 1953."
srael also has been the reci ient not only of
large-scale grants and credits ut of si iﬁcant
technical assistance. As an example, during 1953
Israel sent 50 trainees to the United States under
Toe grants, and plans were develo for making
some 200 technical experts availab e over a 2-year
riod in the ﬁelds of agriculture, ﬁsheries and
orestr , education, public health and sanitation,
natura resources, industry and commerce, and
public administration."
But the United States was also interested in the
broader develo ment of the Near East, since it
believed “that t 1e interests of world peace” called
for “every possible eﬂ'ort to create conditions of
greater calm and stability in the Near East.” In
this interest, President Eisenhower announced on
October 16, 1953, that Eric Johnston was being
sent to the Near East as his personal representa-
tive, with the rank of Ambassador, “to explore
with the governments of the countries of that
region certain steps which might be expected to
contribute to an improvement of the general situa-
tion in the region.” 7" Note was made of the prob-
lem of the Arab refugees as one of the major
causes of disquiet in the Near East, and of the fact
that, during a period of 4 years, the United States
had contributed $153,513,000 to aid these refugees.
One of Mr. Johnston’s major purposes, it was
stated, would be “to undertake discussions with
certain of the Arab States and Israel, looking to
the mutual development of the water resources
of the Jordan River Valley on a regional basis for
the beneﬁt of all the people of the area.” Mr.
Johnston was to make known the concern of the
United States regarding “the continuation of Near
Eastern tensions” and to express its willingness
“to assist in every practicable way in reducing the
areas of controversy.” He was also to indicate
“the importance which the United States Govern-
ment attaches to a regional approach to the devel-
opment of natural resources” which “held a
promise of extensive economic improvement in the
countries concerned through the development of
much needed irrigation and hydroelectric power
and through the creation of an economic base on
the land for a substantial proportion of the Arab
refugees.” The President was convinced that
acceptance of such a comprehensive program
“would contribute greatly to stability in the Near

ir. Johnston who re orted to the President
and Secretary Dulles foﬁowing his return from
the Near East on November 17, indicated that he
had not expected or asked for decisions at this
time from the various governments concerned.
He stated that the attitude which he had encoun—
tered, nevertheless, gave him reason to believe
that, after serious scrutiny, the Jordan Valley
project would commend itself to the states con-
cerned as a sound and constructive ap roach to
some of the most critical issues contri ting to
present tensions in the area. He felt that—
acceptance of the proposals by the Jordan Valley states
would not only go far toward resolving the highly con-
troversial question of rights to the vital water of the River
Jordan, but clear the way for the construction of irrigation
and hydroelectric installations to provide an economic
base in the Jordan Valley for upward of 300,000 people.
This would offer an opportunity to settle a substantial
number of the Arab refugees now living on international
relief rolls in the Arab countries of the region.
Mr. Johnston thought the United Nations could
be trusted with the effective execution of such a
project, noting that each country could undertake
“unilateral commitments to the coordinatin
agenc , which could serve as a clearinghouse an
a cata ytic agent.” 81
South Asia—There have also been signiﬁcant
aid programs in South Asia, such as, for example.
the emergency Export-Import Bank loan of
$1,500,000 to Afghanistan, announced on January
8, 1953, for the purchase of wheat in the United
States, to be distributed by the Afghan Govern-
ment in certain critical areas.82
In the case of India, the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development made a loan of
$31,500,000 on December 18, 1952, to the Indian
Iron and Steel Company in West Bengal, under
the guarantee of the Indian Government, to assist-
the company in carrying out a 5-year project for
increasing blast furnace capacity from 640,000 to
1,400,000 tons of iron and for raising its steel
capacity from 350,000 to 700,000 tons per year?“
Moreover, on December 30, 1952, it was announced
that a TCA agreement had been signed to provide
for an American contribution of $5,200,000, to be
matched by an Indian equivalent of $3,129,000 for
malaria control.‘34 Contracts were signed in New
