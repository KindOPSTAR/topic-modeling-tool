are then reviewed by the International Educa-
tional Exchange Service in consultation with the
appropriate political bureaus of the De artment.
The U.S. Advisory Commission on E ucational
Exchange provides overall policy advice and
guidance.
Exchange proposals from binational U.S. educa-
tional foundations and commissions in countries
participating in the program authorized by the
Fulbright Act are reviewed by both the Depart-
ment and the Board of Foreign Scholarships ap-
pointed by the President.
A constant effort is also made in this country to
coordinate exchanges with other U.S. Government
and private rograms. The Department was in-
strumental, or example, in setting) up an Inter-
Agency Committee on Training rograms and
Exchange of Persons. It has set up a program of
joint instruction for overseas posts, standardiza-
tion of allowances, and c00perative insurance
programs.
Other measures initiated by the Department to
insure teamwork and prevent duplication include
an orientation and English language training pro-
gram for certain incoming grantees of three major
agencies—State, the Foreign Operations Adminis-
tration, and Defense.
The Department has established a clearing
house of information on all U.S. Government
grantees. Working with the Institute of Inter-
national Education, a similar clearinghouse estab-
lished by the institute under a rant from the Ford
Foundation, has been set up or exchanges under
private auspices.
Coordination is maintained also between the ex-
change activities of the Department and the inter-
national information activities of the United
States Information Agency. Procedures have
been established for exchange of information in
Washington. Overseas coordination is assured
since the same staffs operate both programs. (The
Department utilizes overseas personnel of Usm
through a contractual arrangement with that
Agency.)
COOPERATION WITH OTHER EXCHANGE
PROGRAMS
The Department works closely with reputable
private groups here and abroad and with interna-
tional organizations and foreign governments in
carrying out projects sponsored by them that con-
tribute to our Government’s exchange objectives.
Typical of such projects was the placement in
U.S. Government agencies and supervision of 92
United Nations fellows from 36 countries. The
major subjects studied were economic develop-
ment, public administration, and social welfare.
The Department cooperated with such groups
as the American Field Service and the National
4-H Club Foundation in enabling 270 American
and foreign youths to experience life on farms and
in communities of each other’s countries.’
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology con-
tinued to receive help from the Department in its
Forei Student Summer project, under which 60
technical students from 35 countries were brought
to the United States to study at MIT during the
summer months.
The Department gave assistance in publicizing
and facilitating the tours of American artistic
groups such as the American National Ballet
Theatre.
One of the Department’s major activities in
stimulating private exchanges comes under section
201 of the Smith-Mundt Act. This section eases
visa difﬁculties for foreign nationals coming to the
United States for bona ﬁde educational purposes.
For exam 1e, before the act was passed, it would
have been ifﬁcult to carry out the broad kind
of exchange activity envisioned by the Eisenhower
Fellowship Foundation. The before and after
story of the trainee program sponsored by the
American-Scandinavian Foundation illustrates
this point. Previously, it was difﬁcult for a
trainee to obtain a visa that would permit on-
the-job training and observation. In addition,
each trainee had to provide ﬁnancial and other
personal guaranties. In the face of this discour-
agement, the program came to standstill. After
the act was passed, the foundation was able to
provide the necessary guaranties for all trainees
1t sponsored and to qualify as a rogram that
would contribute to the objectives of) the act. To-
day the foundation is bringing in over 500 trainees
annually for training in American industry and
commerce.
By a proving these pro ams, the Department
helps {merican industria , educational, medical,
and other groups to bring foreign nationals to
this country for limited periods of time. Since
July 1, 1953, 195 exchange programs were desig-
nated or amended, bringin to 1, 02 the total num-
ber of programs under w ich foreign nationals
may be currently admitted to this country for
exchange purposes. Hospitals and clinics are the
major users of this service at the present time,
with educational institutions and industrial con-
cerns next in order.
Another exchange activity, involving no U.S.
Government funds, is the asmgnment of American
specialists and the performance of technical serv-
ices under sections 301 and 402 of the Smith-
Mundt Act. During the ast 6 months a total of
$282,000 was advanced by apan, Spain, Australia,
Thailand, Singapore, and Saudi Arabia for carry-
ing out such services.
