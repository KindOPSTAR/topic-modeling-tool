FOREIGN OPERATIONS: A PROGRESS REPORT
A series of new and vital measures to promote
the defense capabilities, economic strength, and
technical advance of the peoples of the free world
marked the progress of the mutual security pro-
gram during the second half of 1953. These
measures reached into every part of the globe,
from Latin America to Western Europe to the
Near East and Africa and around to South Asia
and the Far East. They embraced a multitude
of action programs, diverse in character and
varied in approach, but all with one central objec-
tive: “to maintain the security and promote the
‘ H. Doc. 837, 83d Cong, 2d sess.
foreign policy of the United States.” This is the
objective laid down by the Congress, and every
step taken under the mutual security program has
been directed toward its accomplishment.
The Soviet Union and the overnments under
its control by their actions an attitudes continue
to threaten world peace. The mutual security
program is based on the practical concept that no
one nation, including the United States, can meet
this threat with maximum eil'ectiveness by acting
alone. The resources and capabilities of the entire
free world, strengthened and united in a mutual
effort, constitute the best insurance against further
aggression and the best means ultimately to
remove the tensions and fears which so greatly
retard world progress.
Because the threat has manifested itself in so
many forms and in so many laces, the United
States of necessity has moved) on a number of
fronts. But, everywhere, the basic urpose of
our operations abroad has been to bui d stren h
and stabilit throu bout the free world. T is
purpose un erlies a1 mutual securit programs
whether they concern military ai , economic
support, technical cooperation, or world-wide use
of our farm surpluses. These measures reinforce
the security of the United States; simultaneously,
they hel to increase the self-reliance of our free
world al ies.
In terms of tangible returns for the United
States, the mutual security program provides
overseas military bases, combat-ready manpower
greater in numbers than our own, more productive
sources of strategic materials, added industrial
ca acity, and healthier, stronger partner nations.
A ove all, it encourages millions of peo 1e to work
with us in the unceasing quest for wor d stability
and world peace.
ECONOMIC IMPROVEMENT AND SHIFT IN EMPHASIS OF All)
Of particular importance in inﬂuencing the
recent course of United States mutual security
programs has been the general improvement in
world economic conditions.
One indication of the strong recovery in the
economic health of the free nations of the world
lies in a comparison of United States aid and
United States exports over the past 4 years. In
1949, this country ﬁnanced about 35 percent of
its total exports of nonmilitary goods and serv-
