tives of Peiping the United States will not be
deviatin in any respect from its policy of non-
recognition of Red China. the following statement
was incorporated in the Berlin resolution at our
insistence:
It is understood that neither the invitation to, nor the
holding of, the above-mentioned conference shall be
deemed to imply diplomatic recognition in any case where
it has not already been accorded.
What could be clearer than this?
I have digressed brieﬂy on the subject of the
forthcoming conference at Geneva in order to
point out that our agreement to participate in this
conference does not represent a departure from
our policy with respect to China. This policy is
based upon our appraisal of the situation which
confronts us in China. Nothing happened at
Berlin to alter this ap raisal.
On the other hand, t ie conference will be a test
of Communist professions and intentions, and it
is the more important, therefore, that we have a
thorough understanding of what the United States
and its free-world partners stand for and the prob-
lems and issues the Communists pose. \Ve must
have such an understanding if we are to deal
realistically with these issues with the Chinese
Communists at Geneva, and to determine how, if
at all, the high goals we seek to achieve with re-
spect to Korea and Indochina can be reached there
through negotiation.
The Chinese Communlst Regime
What is the situation that confronts us today
on the China mainland? I will describe it brieﬂy
only in terms of power.
In the 41/2 ears since the establishment of their
regime, the hinese Communists have with ruth-
less eﬁiciency set out not only to liquidate all overt
political opposition but also to el1minate sources
of potential opposition. On the basis of available
evidence, the Peiping re 'me has largely succeeded
in accomplishing the rst objective throughout
most of China. Landlords, so-called “counter-
revolutionaries,” and farmers-turned-guerrillas
have been slain by the millions in the process.
The regime wi 1 never succeed in the second of
these objectives, of course, for virtually the whole
population of the mainland will remain a source of
potential opposition. Nevertheless, by such de-
vices as the so-called “5-anti campaign, ’ the Com-
munists have struck heavily at social-economic
grou s—such as the urban middle class, for ex-
amp e—which they distrust and which are logical
sources of potential opposition leadership. The
result of these and other olicies has been to con-
solidate the hold of the ommunist regime over
the mainland to a point Where, for the predictable
future at least, there is no prospect of its being
seriously shaken by domestic opposition, however
much the people may cry out in their hearts against
the evil which has befallen them.
For purposes of policy determination, therefore,
it must be estimated that, short of large-scale inter-
vention, the Communist regime at Peiping will
continue to exercise effective control over the main-
land and to utilize the human and material re-
sources of that vast area to increase its own power.
If this assumption is correct, it then becomes a
matter of urgent concern to us to estimate how
Peiping may be expected to use this power derived
from its control of the Chinese'mainland. The
record shows that it will be used to serve the inter-
ests of the Soviet bloc, which the regime identi-
ﬁes with its own.
At the very outset, the Mao regime declared that
it was by choice in the Soviet camp, announcing
that it would pursue a “lean to one side” olicy in
foreign affairs—one of the greatest un erstate-
ments of the ages. The alacrity with which the
Soviet Union and its satellites recognized the new
regime indicated that this policy came as no sur-
prise to them and attested to their conviction that
the new regime was genuinely Communist. Thus
the Peiping regime, which was established on
October 1, 1949, was notiﬁed on October 2 by the
U.S.S.R. of its decision to establish diplomatic
relations.
This was accomplished the very next day, and
the Soviet’s Eastern European satellites, Bul-
garia, Rumania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and
oland, dutifully followed suit on October 4, 5,
6, and 7, respectively. The North Korean ime,
the East German Communist satellite, an the
so-called “Peoples Republic of Mongolia,” which
is legitimately Chinese territory, also established
diplomatic relations with the Peiping regime
during the ﬁrst month of its existence.
Since then, the Chinese Communist regime has
progressively strengthened its ties with the So-
viet Union and other Communist states through
various treaties and agreements. For example,
on February 16, 1950, it concluded with Moscow
a so-called “Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship,
Alliance, and Mutual Assistance”; an agreement
on the Chang Chun Railroad, Port Arthur, and
Dairen; and an agreement on the grant of credit.
This event was f0 lowed by conclusion of a barter
agreement with Poland on March 1, a barter
agreement with the Soviet Union on April 19, a
trade agreement with East Germany on October
10. In subsequent years it has concluded agree-
ments with the other satellite states.
Spread of Soviet Inﬂuence
But Pei ing has not been content simply with
strengthening its external ties with the Soviet
Union and its satellites. It has actively intro-
duced Soviet inﬂuence into China itself. Thus
thousands of Soviet advisers in diverse ﬁelds have
been brought in by the Mao regime following its
conclusion with Moscow, on March 27, 1950, of
“an agreement for the enlistment of the services
