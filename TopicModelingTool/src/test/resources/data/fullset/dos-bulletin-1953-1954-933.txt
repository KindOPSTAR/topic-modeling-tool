complishment second to none in realizing the
United Nations determination to remove the basic
causes of international instabilit and tension.
As a matter of fact, there are iterally millions
of poo le in faraway parts of the earth, who, when
queries on the United Nations and what it is, think
only of the W110, known in many parts of the
world as “WHO.” I am reminded of an episode in
Thailand. An Indian doctor working on malaria
control in a remote villa e in Northern Siam
asked the local head man a ew uestions: Had he
ever heard of Mr. Nehru? “ 0”; had he ever
heard of Mr. Eisenhower? “No”; had he ever
heard of the U.N.? “N0”; had he ever heard of
WHO? “Oh, yes, Mr. WHO is the man who took off
my clothes and s rayed my house and we have
had no more sick abies—very ood man.” By so
sim le an ex erience as this t e positive accom-
plis ments 0 the United Nations are removing
the conditions and attitudes which foster the
spread of communism.
I have reviewed for you some of the accomplish-
ments and some of the problems of our participa-
tion in the United Nations. I have taken a fresh
look at the means offered by this organization to
keep the peace, to resist aggression, and to remove
the conditions which foster the growth of com-
munism. I would ask each of on to take a fresh
look at this organization from t e point of view of
what it was intended to do2 what its accomplish-
ments have been, and the kind of world in which
it has to operate. I am sure that when you do
take this fresh look, whether you have had too
high or too low an estimate of the United Nations,
you will agree with us that it is a necessary and
effective instrument for us and all free nations.
It deserves and needs your strong and well-in-
formed support.
Guatemalan Situation
NEWS CONFERENCE STATEMENT
BY SECRETARY DULLES
Press release 323 dated June 15
At his news conference on June 15, Secretary
Dulles was asked about reports that the United
States would at the June 16' meeting of the Organi-
zation of American States call for a meeting of
Foreign Ministers to discuss the Guatemala/n sit-
uation. He was also asked about reports that
Guatemalan President Arbene had been given an
ultimatum by Guatemalan Army oﬂieers to disso-
ciate himself from communism or resign. Mr.
Dulles made the following reply:
I am not able to conﬁrm either report, which
does not mean that the may not be true. There
has been an exchange 0 views gomg on as between
the American States with respect to the possibility
of a meeting of the Organization of American
States some time in the near future. I have no
knowledge that it would be brought up at the
particular meeting that you refer to. So far, the
exchanges of views that have been taking place
have been through diplomatic channels.
As far as the situation in Guatemala is con-
cerned, we don’t have any information which is
from a clearly dependable source. We have heard
the same reports as those you referred to. No
doubt there is going on somewhat of a reign of
terror in Guatemala. There is no doubt in my
opinion but what the reat majority of the Guate~
malan people have bog: the desire and the capabil-
ity of cleaning their own house. But, of course,
those things are difﬁcult to do in face of the Com-
munist ty of terrorism which is manifesting
itself in uatemala and which is perhaps most
dramatically expressed by the statement of one
Communist member of the Guatemalan C0
that if there was a disturbance, that would mark
the beginning of a beheading of all anti-Commu-
nist elements in Guatemala.
I am conﬁdent that the great ma'ority of the
Géiatemalan people do not want t at state of
a airs.
