The Threat of a Red Asia
Address by Secretary Dulles ‘
This provides a timely occasion for outlinin
the administration’s thinking about two relate
matters—Indochina and the Chinese Communist
re ime.
ndochina is important for many reasons. First,
and always ﬁrst, are the human values. About
30 million peo 10 are seeking for themselves the
dignit of sel -government. Until a few years
ago, t ey formed merely7 a French dlelpendency.
Now, their three politica units—Viet- am Laos,
and Cambodia—are exercisin a considerable
measure of independent olitica authority within
the French Union. Eac of the three is now rec-
ognized by the United States and by more than
30 other nations. They signed the Japanese peace
treaty with us. Their independence is not yet
complete. But the French Government last Jul
declared its intention to complete that inde en -
ence, and negotiations to consummate that p edge
are actively under way.
The United States is watching this development
with close attention and great sympathy. \Ve do
not forget that we were a colony that won its
freedom. \Ve have sponsored in the Philippines
a cons icuously successful development of politi-
cal in ependence. We feel a sense of kinship with
those everywhere who yearn for freedom.
The Communists are attempting to prevent the
orderly development of inde ndence and to con-
fuse the issue before the wor d. The Communists
have, in these matters, a regular line which Stalin
laid down in 1924.
The scheme is to whip u the s irit of national-
ism so that it becomes vio ent. hat is done by
rofessional agitators. Then the violence is en-
arged by Communist military and technical lead-
ership and the provision of military supplies. In
these ways, international communism gets a
stranglehold on the people and it uses that power
to “amalgamate” the peoples into the Soviet
orbit.
“Amalgamation” is Lenin’s and Stalin’s word to
describe their process.

Communist Imperialism In Indochina
“Amalgamation” is now being attempted in
Indochina under the ostensible leadership of Ho
Chi Minh. He was indoctrinated in Moscow. He
became an associate of the Russian, Borodin, when
the latter was organizing the Chinese Communist
Party which was to bring China into the Soviet
oibit. Then Ho transferred his activities to Indo-
0 ma.
Those ﬁghting under the banner of Ho Chi
Minh have largely been trained and equipped in
Communist China. They are supplied with artil-
lery and ammunition throu h the Soviet-Chinese
Communist bloc. Capture matériel shows that
much of it was fabricated by the Skoda Munition
Works in Czechoslovakia and transported across
Russia and Siberia and then sent through China
into Viet-Nam. Military supplies for the Com-
munist armies have been pouring into Viet-Nam
at a steadily increasing rate.
Military and technical guidance is supplied by
an estimated 2,000 Communist Chinese. They
function with the forces of Ho Chi Minh in ke
positions—in staﬂ' sections of the High Comman ,
at the division level, and in specialized units such
as signal, engineer, artillery and transportation.
In the present stage, the Communists in Indo-
china use nationalistlc anti-French slogans to win
local support. But if they achieved military or
olitical success, it is certain that they would sub-
]ect the people to a cruel Communist dictatorship
taking its orders from Peiping and Moscow.
The Scope of the Danger
The tragedy would not stop there. If the Com-
munist forces won uncontested control over Indo-
china or any substantial part thereof they would
surely resume the same pattern of aggression
against other free peoples in the area.
The propagandists of Red China and Russia
make it ap arent that the purpose is to dominate
all of Sout east Asia.
Southeast Asia is the so-called “rice bowl”
which helps to feed the densely populated re 'on
that extends from India to Japan. It is ric in
