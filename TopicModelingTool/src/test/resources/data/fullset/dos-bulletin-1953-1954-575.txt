through consultative procedures and cooperation
in international conferences such as those spon-
sored by the International Labor Organization.
These recommendations for renewal and amend-
ment of the Trade Agreements Act are based on
the plain truth that if we wish to sell abroad we
must buy abroad.
The General Agreement on Tarllts and Trade
Since 1948, virtually all the major trading na-
tions of the world, including the United States,
have become parties to a General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade. This agreement has been the
grincipal arrangement by which we in the United
tates have sought to carry out the provisions and
purposes of the Trade Agreements Act.
The Commission on Forei Economic Policy
has recommended that the United States rene-
gotiate the organizational provisions of the agree-
ment, so that the contracting parties acting
collectively would conﬁne their functions to
sponsorin multilateral trade negotiations, recom-
mending road trade olicies for individual con-
sideration by the legis ative or other appropriate
authorities in the various countries, and providing
a forum for consultation regarding trade disputes.
I shall act promptly upon this recommendation.
At the same time, I shall su gest to other con-
tracting parties revisions of the substantive pro-
visions of the agreement to provide a simpler,
stronger instrument contributing more eﬂ’ectively
to the development of a workable system of world
trade. When the organizational provisions of the
agreement have been renegotiated, they will be
submitted to the Congress for its approval.
Customs Administretlon and Procedure
The problems of tariff classiﬁcation, of proper
valuation of imported articles and of procedures
for administering the customs are complex and
perplexing. Over the years these problems have
grown to the point where they now constitute an
unwarranted and unintended burden on trade.
The United States may be no worse in this re-
gard than many other nations, but good business
practice alone is suﬂicient to require:
a. Simpliﬁcation of commodity deﬁnitions, clas-
siﬁcations, and rate structure;
b. Improvement in the methods of valuation of
imports; and
c. Establishment of more efﬁcient procedures
for customs administration.
To this end I shall propose legislation providing
for the simpliﬁcation of the commodity deﬁnitions
and rate structures in the Tariff Act, after a study
by the Tariff Commission, and subject to appro-
priate standards to be established by the Congress.
Such legislation should also provide for a better
method of classiﬁcation of articles not enumerated
in the tariff schedules, and for such improvement
in the statutes governing the administration of
customs procedures as can be made at this time.
In this connection I am directing the Department
of the Treasury to kee customs procedures under
continuous review ant to re ort to the Congress
annually on the difﬁculties and) delays in processing
goods through Customs, together with recommen-
ations for action to eliminate such obstructions.
I further recommend that the antidumping law
and procedures under it be changed so far as nec-
essary to permit speedier and more efﬁcient dis-
posal of cases and to prevent undue interference
with trade during investigation of suspected
dumping.
To provide an improved basis for customs valu-
ations I urge adoption of the Treasury’s valuation
proposals. These are embodied in H. R. 6584
which has already been passed by the House of
Representatives.
United States Investment Abroad
An increased ﬂow of United States investment
abroad could contribute signiﬁcantly to the needed
ex ansion of international trade. It also could
help maintain a high level of economic activity and
employment in the United States. Further, such
investment contributes to the development abroad
of primary resources needed to meet our own ever-
increasing needs even while it helps to strengthen
the economies of foreign countries. In view of the
cat importance of private investment to our
oreign economic policy, I emphasize the necessity
for passage of the administration tax bill already
recommended to you and already advanced in your
considerations which provides for:
a. Taxation of business income from foreign
subsidiaries or from se egated foreign
branches which operate andr elect to be taxed
as subsidiaries at a rate 14 percentage points
lower than the regular corporate rate;
b. Broadening the deﬁnition of foreign taxes
which may be credited against the United
States income tax to include any tax, which
is the principal form of taxation on business
in a country, except turnover, general sales
taxes or excise, and social security taxes;
0. Removing of the overall limitation on for-
eign tax credits; and
d. Permitting regulated investment companies
concentrating on foreign investment to pass
on to their stockholders the credit for for-
eign taxes which would be available on
direct investment.
Further to encourage the ﬂow of private invest-
ment abroad, we shall give full diplomatic sup-
port, through our activities here and through our
missions and representatives in the ﬁeld, to the
