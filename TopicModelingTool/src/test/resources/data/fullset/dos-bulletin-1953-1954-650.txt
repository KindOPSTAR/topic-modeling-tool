of information is the elimination of government
restrictions. There is far too much use, some
times arbitrary, of such restrictions as censorship,
suppression and coercion of information media,
and repressive regulations. A free press cannot
breathe in a climate of oppression.
The most complete controls exist in the Soviet
world, in keeping with its totalitarian nature.
But there are many countries which do acce t the
principle of freedom of information an yet
stiﬂe it in practice, from time to time, throu h
censorship and other suppressive measures. T e
extent of such ractices—as pointed out in the
memorandum oi) the International Press Insti-
tute and in the Associated Press surveys of cen-
sorship—should be priority subjects for further
work on freedom of information.
At this point I want to say a few words about
the criticism to which the Associated Press and the
International Press Institute were subjected by
several speakers last Friday. These two insti-
tutions were accused of falsely reporting on the
existence of various forms of censorship in cer-
tain countries, and the rapporteur of the Council
was upbraided for making use of their reports.
I ask, Mr. President, what other reports could
the rap orteur have used to point up the existence
of Wirizspread censorship ractices? Govern-
ments, particularly those w ich have frequent
recourse to censorship, are not in the habit of
advertising their use of these ractices. Even in
our own organization, the U. . and in Unasco,
governments have only too frequently preferred
to indulge in pious eneralities about the evils
of censorshi rather t an to encourage or permit
factual stu ies of concrete censorship practices
in scores of countries which profess to believe in
freedom of the press.
Mr. President, I submit that our rapporteur de-
serves high praise rather than criticism for hav-
ing had the courage to direct the spotlight of
public opinion on the existence of forms of censor-
ship so frequent, so widespread, so all compre-
hensive as to be a most serious threat to freedom
of information. And we owe a debt of gratitude
also to the newsmen in the Associated Press and
the International Press Institute who in their
struggle for freedom of information dare to incur
the disfavor of governments by publishing what
Mr. Lopez himself calls “factual reports on con-
ditions which can be undertaken effectively by the
profession.”
It seems to me that the time has come when the
Council itself must take steps to encourage the
elimination of unwarranted government restric-
tions of the free ﬂow of news. Fact ﬁnding is a
ﬁrst step toward such elimination of restrictions.
Rather than criticize the efforts of those who are
trying to keep us informed about such restrictions
we should support, as a matter of highest priority,
the proposal of Mr. Lopez of two worldwide sur-
veys to be undertaken by the rapporteur next year.
The ﬁrst is a worldwide survey of current internal
censorship practices together with recommenda-
tions, where practicable, for remedial action. The
second is a Similar survey regarding censorship of
outgoing news dispatches. I am struck by the
fact that these two proposals are omitted in the
long list of resolutions submitted by the French
delegation. I do hope that this omission is un-
intentional and that the Council will act on these
proposals for worldwide surveys of censorship as
two of the most constructive and realistic pro-
posals of the Lopez report.
The United States, which proposed the appoint-
ment of a rapporteur at the 14th Session of the
Council for an ex eriinental period of 1 year, con-
siders that Mr. opez' work has amply justiﬁed
this function. Therefore, we think it would be
useful to appoint a rapporteur for another year
to carry out the most urgent tasks suggested in
the report—including the two I have mentioned
above. We would be happy to have Mr. Lopez
continue to serve in this capacity.
Loosening the fetters of government restrictions
Will contribute to greater freedom of information.
But tightening these fetters will have the op osite
effect. And this is precisel what I fear will)hap-
pen if we indulge in furtier attempts to frame
generalized conventions on freedom of informa-
tion. _ No matter how altruistic our intentions,
experience shows that we would end up with texts
which would be used by some governments as a
pretext for sanctioning or further restricting free-
om of information. The convention approach
seems most unwise in 1i ht of the experience of
the past few years on t 0 Draft Convention on
Freedom of Information, which might better be
called Restrictions on Information. Under pres-
ent_world conditions, attempts to formulate inter-
national legal commitments are more likely to
hinder rather than advance the cause of freedom
of information. With our limited facilities and
resources we should concentrate on the jobs we can
do, instead of dissipating our efforts on jobs we
cannot do.
Barriers to Freedom ot Information
Mr. President, the second problem area—eco-
nomic and technical barriers to the ﬂow of infor-
mation—offers real promise of useful work. Here
we face such problems as the production and dis-
tribution of newsprint, press and telecommunica-
tions facilities, rates and priorities, tariff and
trade practices, and, perhaps most important, lack
of local information media.
It is hard for us, here in the Council, to have
a real feeling about some of these problems. We
have freedom to speak. We have responsible
journalists coverin our debates. We can step
into the Delegates unge and read newspapers
from all over the world, or can obtain the latest
