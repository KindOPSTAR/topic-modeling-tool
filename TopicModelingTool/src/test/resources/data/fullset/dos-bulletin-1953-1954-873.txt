spire the whole world with a new respect for the
opinions of mankind and a renewed conﬁdence in
our only existing institution of international order
and justice—the United Nations.
The majorit of us came here in the hope that
the question 0 Korean independence and uniﬁca-
tion would receive the careful, sym athetic atten-
tion at Geneva that it deserves. ixteen of our
delegations believe sincerely that the eople of
Korea, from the Yalu to the southern siiores, are
entitled to our most earnest efforts to give them
independence and unity. They deserve better
than to be made the subject of a propaganda
campaign. Yet I grieve to say that this is what
we have been witnessing.
If we did not understand the insidious strategy
of communism, we would be sur rised to ﬁnd three
peoples with such long and in nitely varied his-
tories and cultures as North Korea, Russia, and
Communist China suddenly appearing so identical
on one side of this Conference. Thelr words and
their actions are interchangeable.
And what have they ut forward on Korea?
After months of delay, t is is what they tell us:
Rejectlon of U.N. Authority
They deny that the United Nations has any
authority or moral force to deal with the roblem
of uniﬁcation of Korea. They repu iate as
shameful and ille _al the United Nations resolu-
tions on Korea. hey reject any United Nations
supervision in Korea. They reject overwhelming
world opinion which looks to the United Nations
as the one fundamental instrument for maintain-
in eace and security.
us they erect another Iron Curtain at Geneva
designed to shut out any constructive effort by
this Conference toward the attainment of its goals.
Then our Communist colleagues ask us to ac-
cept proposals for Korea’s uniﬁcation which would
prowde for elections “ﬁrst on paper, last in rac-
tice, free in name but rigged in fact ” as Mr. den
put it so well. More than this, they have con-
cocted an elaborate device which, when analyZed,
is nothing more than the Soviet veto system, the
paralytic effect of which the world has witnessed
on so many previous occaswns.
This formula would permit the imposed dic-
tatorship of a minority of the Korean eople still
living in North Korea to obstruct orever the
freely elected representatives of the great majority
of the people in Korea. B this formula a re ' e
which is shrouded in dar ess would shac e a
government whose legitimacy and representative
character have been repeatedly recognized by the
United Nations; and it would not even give the
captive minority of Koreans a chance to speak for
themselves in genuinely free elections open to the
world to see.
As if all that were not sufficient, the Communists
would have us agree in advance to tie our hands
and close our eyes while a divided Korea, quaran-
tined from the rest of the world and isolated from
the United Nations, is absorbed into the Commu-
nist orbit. A few days ago Secretary Dulles made
this statement to the people of the United States-
More than 140,000 Americans were killed and wounded
under the United Nations command to keep Korea from
being overrun by armed invasion. I promise you that we
shall not surrender at . . . Geneva the freedom t0r which
so many fought and died.‘
I must repeat, as the Netherlands Foreign Min-
ister already has so convincingly pointed out, that
ten members of the Securit Council, in November
1950, afﬁrmed the policy 0 the United Nations to
hold the Chinese frontier with Korea inviolate,
and fully to protect legitimate Chinese and Korean
interests in the frontier zone. This would have
produced a genuinely eaceful and united Korea
if the Soviet Union ha not vetoed the joint reso-
lution, and if shortly thereafter the Chinese Com-
munists had not invaded Korea in force across
that frontier.
Despite all this, there is basis on which we can
still build a new life for all the eo le of Korea.
It is not too late to fulﬁll our objectives of estab-
lishing, by peaceful means, a united and independ-
ent Korea. All we need is the courage and will to
accept, honestly, the reality of the principles that
have been expressed in our meetings.
There must be a sincere effort toward modera-
tion and a search for an accord, as so many rep-
resentatives have urged.
There must be clearly reafﬁrmed our respect for
the authority and moral force of the United Na-
tions. This Conference can, if it so wills, declare
an act of faith in the United Nations. The United
States associates itself unreservedly with the sup-
ort which the lar e majority of my colleagues
ere have expresse for the United Nations. It
is the only instrument left to us for riddin the
world of the scourge of war. It is a moral orce
for eace. It is the one remaining instrumental-
ity or maintaining collective security. It will be
a tragic day for all the people of the world if,
as has been threatened here, the United Nations
is discredited and condemned, if its resolutions are
spurned as scraps of paper, and if the peoples of
the world are cast adrift without this anchor in
which they have placed their trust.
There must be recognition of the need to rely on
the cooperation of the United Nations in helping
the Korean people themselves to bridge the wide
gulf which years of separation and war have
created. This cooperation will not impair in any
way the inherent right of the Korean people to
make the decisions that affect their own destiny.
No lasting peace or security can come to the
people of Korea unless their right to unity and
independence is exercised in an atmosphere of
