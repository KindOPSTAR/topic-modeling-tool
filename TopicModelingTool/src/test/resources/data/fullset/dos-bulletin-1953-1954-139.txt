stake and will in the near future reach their
decisions.
NATO is engaged in a reappraisal of strategy and
tactics to reﬂect the prospective availability of
atomic and other new weapons. These studies, to
be meaningful, require the dissemination of cer—
tain information regarding atomic weapons to
NATO commanders. This will have a signiﬁcant
impact on NATO lanning and provide a greater
measure of security for all. I shall recommend
that the Congress amend the Atomic Energy Act
to permit us to disseminate classiﬁed information
to our allies with regard to the tactical use of
atomic weapons. This, of course, would be accom-
lished under stringent security regulations. It
is essential that action on this matter be taken by
the Con ess during the current session.
In In ochina, where the French Union and As-
sociated States forces are holding back Communist
efforts to expand into the free areas of Asia, the
United States is making a major contribution by
providing military equipment and other military
su port. The amount as well as the timeliness of
this military asistance will be an important factor
in improvin the situation. Additional native
forces must trained and equipped to preserve
the defensive strength of Indochina. This assist-
ance is required to enable these gallant forces to
sustain an offensive that will provide the oppor-
tunity for victory.
We have helped the Chinese Nationalist forces
to strengthen the defense of the island of Formosa.
This assistance will be continued as will assistance
to other countries of the free world such as the
Philippines, Thailand, and some of the American
Repu ics
The mutual military program, like our domestic
militar program, is now designed to build
strengt for the long pull rather than meet a given
target date. Accor ingly, we will concentrate on
helping equip forces which our allies can them-
selves support over a long period of time, with
minimum dependence u on aid from the United
States. We have succee ed in substantially reduc-
ing the need for additional funds in ﬁscal year
1955 compared to previous years.
Our mutual security program continues in two
related parts—the economic and technical pro-
gram is much smaller in amount than the mutual
military program and is discussed in a later section
under international affairs. In that section is a
comparative summary of the combined program.
Development and Control of Atomlc Energy
In my speech before the United Nations on De-
cember 8, 1953,2 I made proposals looking toward
a resolution of the atomic danger which threatens
the world. My budgetary recommendations for
the program of the Atomic Energy Commission
for the ﬁscal year 1955 contem late both new ef-
forts to advance peacetime app ications of atomic
energy and also additional roduction of ﬁssion-
able materials. All men 0 good will hope that
these ﬁssionable materials, which can be used both
for peace and for military defense, will ultimately
he used solely for peace and the beneﬁt of all man-
ind.
Under the recommendations in this budget, ex-
penditures of the Atomic Ener Commissmn will
rise in the ﬁscal year 1955 to t e hi hest point in
our history. Operating costs willg rise signiﬁ-
cantly as new] com leted plants are brought into
production. apita expenditures will continue at
a high level as construction goes forward on major
new plants authorized in recent years. New ob-
ligational authority recommended in 1955 is above
that provided in 1954, because of the expansion in
operations. Initiation of new construction proj-
ects will be at a lower level than in recent ears,
and they will be limited essentially to facilities
directly related to the reduction pro am and to
several urgently needed) research and evelopment
facilities. In all areas of activity the Commission
is making strenuous efforts to effect economies; re-
sults are being accomplished in the reduction of
unit costs.
The increase in expenditures for operations
from $912 million in the ﬁscal year 1954 to $1,182
million in 1955 is due primarily to expanded 0 er-
ations at the Commiss10n’s facilities at Oak Rig ,
Paducah, Portsmouth, Hanford, and Savannah
River, as plants are completed and placed in opera-
tion. To meet the greater requirements for raw
materials for this enlarged productive capacity,
increased amounts of uranium ores and concen-
trates will be purchased. Due to vigorous efforts
in recent years to expand our sources of supply in
this country and abroad, increased amounts are
now being made available to match the increase in
requirements.
Atomic reactor development will be focused
particularly upon the development of industrial
atomic power for peacetime uses. The Commis-
sion wi move forward on the construction of a
large atomic power reactor to be initiated in the
ﬁscal year 1954, marking a signiﬁcant advance in
the technolo of peacetime atomic power. Re-
search and evelopment, including construction
of ex erimental facilities, will continue also on
severa other types of reactors which show prom-
ise of ultimately producing power at economic
rates.
The launchin —this month—0f the ﬁrst atomic
submarine, the . S. S. Nautilus,3 will be followed
in the ﬁscal year 1955 by the launching of the
U. S. S. Seawolf, a second atomic submarine of
different design. Research on the more difﬁcult
problems of aircraft propulsion by atomic energy
will continue.
