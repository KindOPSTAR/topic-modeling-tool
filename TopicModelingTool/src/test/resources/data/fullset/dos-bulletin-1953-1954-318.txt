endan red international peace and security, nor
that t 0 General Assembly was “equipped to act
as a court, to adjudicate the various c aims which
have been made by various parties concerning
events in Morocco.” But it could be hoped that
France and Morocco would “move continually
closer to other in achieving self-government for
the people of Morocco.” Moreover, Ambassador
Lodge was encouraged by the statement of Maurice
Schumann to the General Assembly on September
25, in which he described the French proposals for
- reform in Morocco as to elected representative
assemblies, independence of the judiciary, protec-
tion of the rights of the individual, and legal free-
dom for labor unions. Ambassador Lod e hoped
that any action in the General Assemb y would
“promote an atmosphere” in which France and
Morocco would “move continually closer in eﬁ'ec-
tuating self-government for the people of
Morocco.”“
Similar] , in connection with the Tunisian prob-
lem, Davi W. Wainhouse ex lained in Commit-
tee I on October 26 ‘2 that the nited States looked
forward “to increasing self-government for Tu-
nisia” and was convinced “that this objective
should be attained through harmonious agreement
between France and Tunisia.” In the American
view, however, the proposed resolution was “not
likely to advance this objective.” As Ambassador
Lodge explained in the plenary session of the Gen-
eral Assembly on November 11,“ the United States
favored “the ideal of self-government,” and be-
lieved that “negotiations between the French and
Tunisians” were “the best approach to the solution
of this question.” The General Assembly, he ar-
gued, should encourage, not discourage, such nego-
tiations, and resolutions which exacerbated “the
relations between the French and the Tunisians”
were “not calculated to further the objective of
bilateral negotiations and therefore in our view
tend to defeat their proper purpose.”
The Kashmir Problem
Although the United States was not directly
involved with the problem of Kashmir, between
India and Pakistan, it was much interested in an
equitable solution of this issue, which had troubled
the relations of these two countries since 1947.“
