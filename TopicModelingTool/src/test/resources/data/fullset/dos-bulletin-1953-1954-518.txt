of Soviet experts by China.” These Soviet ad-
visers play an important role in shaping Red
China’s economic life and building its military
establishment alon Soviet lines.
In order to faci itate the spread of Soviet in-
ﬂuence, the teaching of the Russian language has
been vigorously pushed and will become compul-
sory in all midd e schools as soon as the supply
of teachers permits. Soviet political and cul-
tural writings have also been translated in large
numbers and distributed widely. According to
the Chinese Communist publication A Guide to
New China (1953 edition), the Sino-Soviet
Friendship Association, which was established
less than a week after the Peiping regime itself
and now claims a membership of over ($8 million,
had b the end of September 1952 published 91
perio icals and 1,990 booklets, with a total cir-
culation of over 14,600,000 copies, had iven
35,518 moving picture shows to a total audience
of 37,700,000, and had arranged 29,769 photo-
graplhic exhibitions visited by 81,400,000 peo le.
T e Guide describes the Sino-Soviet Friends ip
Association as “a vast organization whose aim is
to further and to consolidate a fraternal friend-
ship and cooperation between the Chinese and
Soviet peoples and to develop interﬂow of knowl-
edge and experience of the two great nations.”
From all appearances, however, the alleged inter-
ﬂow of knowledge and experience is rincipally
a one-way thoroughfare for the spread) of Soviet
inﬂuence in every walk of life on the mainland
of China.
In effect, China is being deliberately and sys-
tematically swamped by alien Soviet ideas, values,
institutions, and practices. \Vhile the Peiping
regime has thus integrated itself more and more
closely with the Soviet bloc externally and de-
liberately intensiﬁed Soviet inﬂuence within
China, it has at the same time assumed a posture
of open hostility toward the “'est, especially the
United States, and energetically sought to root
out every vestige of Western cultural, economic,
and political inﬂuence from the mainland. I do
not have to elaborate this point before this audi-
ence, or remind you that in the process many of
your colleagues, both Chinese and foreign, have
suffered serious personal injury and abuse. There
are still 32 Americans incarcerated in Chinese
Communist prisons.
The motivation of the Chinese Communist lead-
ers in closing down American missions colleges,
schools, and cultural institutes is not difﬁcult to
understand, of course. The message which these
institutions brought, the teachings which they
spread, were incompatible with the materialistic,
state-supremacy ideology of the new masters at
Peiping. Nor can one be surprised that the busi-
ness enterprises of the Western democracies
should be so heavily taxed and so circumscribed
by restrictions as to make them inoperable, for
the economic theories of the Peiping regime en-
visage the total control of the economic life of the
country by the state.
Aggresslon In Korea
The full signiﬁcance in terms of balance-of-
power relationships in the Far East of Mao Tse-
tung’s transformation of the Chinese mainland
into a gigantic Communist base was ainfully
brought home to the world in Novem er 1950,
when Chinese Communist troops by the hundreds
of thousands poured into Korea and engaged
United Nations and Re ublic of Korea forces in
combat, Like their orth Korean allies, the
Chinese Communist armies were continuously
supplied with Soviet equipment. This event
demonstrated beyond question not only the
solidity of the Peiping re 'me’s alinement with
the Communist bloc but a so its willingness and
ability to resort to open aggression in pursuit of
bloc objectives. If there had been any doubt
previously about the nature of the Mac regime, it
was eliminated by Communist China’s interven-
tion in Korea.
For this act it was just] condemned as an ag-
gressor by the United Nations General Assembly.
But is there reason to believe that the cessation
of hostilities in Korea has changed this picture!
Thus far, unfortunately, there has been no indi-
cation that the Peiping regime, since the conclu-
sion of the Korean Armistlce Agreement on July
27, 1953, has changed its international outlook in
any si iﬁcant respect. The regime has continued
its vio ent hate campai against the United States
and various Asian an Western Governments as-
sociated with it; it has continued to support the
Communist-led Viet Minh rebels against the le-
gitimate Governments of Viet-Nam, Cambodia,
and Laos; it has continued to give covert encour-
agement and support to Communist guerrillas and
other subversive groups in Southeast Asian coun-
tries; and it has persisted in its gross mistreat-
ment of foreign nationals whom it has detained.
In short, the Peiping regime has failed to make
a single move since the Armistice Agreement was
signed in Korea to indicate that the policies which
led to its aggression in Korea have been aban-
doned. Signature of the Armistice Agreement by
the Chinese Communists did not in itself repre-
sent a shift in policy but only in tactics, a shift
caused by the failure of previous tactics in the
face of the heroic defense of its homeland by the
Republic of Korea’s army with the decisive as-
sistance of United Nations forces. Thus the Com-
munists ceased hostilities in Korea for practical
not for moral reasons or because their objectives
had changed.
The behavior of the Chinese Communists with
respect to the Armistice Agreement itself, in fact,
affords another insight into the nature of their
policies. I will cite three examples brieﬂy:
