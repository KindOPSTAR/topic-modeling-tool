members conform to a pattern which is prescribed
by rulers possessed of absolute power. This in-
herently involves a suppression of freedom, for
freedom implies divers1ty, not conformity.
But it is not enough that freedom be suppressed
within what is now the Soviet orbit. Freedom
is contagious. Accordingl , freedom outside that
orbit cannot be acquiescedy in. The area of sup-
pression must be constantly expanded in order
to reserve the existing area of suppression.
has, the Soviet Communist rulers seem to have
been driven by their own doctrine, by their own
fears, to seek constantly in one way or another
to extend their control until there is ﬁnally
achieved the goal which Lenin referred to as “the
amalgamation of all nations” and which Stalin
referred to as “the amalgamation of the masses
into a single state union.”
It may be said that Lenin and Stalin are dead.
So they are. But their doctrine is not dead. It
continues to be tau ht to Communists throughout
the world, and t ey continue to practice it
throughout the world.
As the record stands to this date, the Commu-
nist rulers have at no time, at no place, voluntarily
relaxed their grasp on what they had. This is
so even though as in the case of Eastern Germany,
Austria, and North Korea, they had promised
that the grasp was only temporary. Also, in
every non-Communist nation of the world the
agents of international communism work to
achieve the amalgamation of the nation and its
peo 1e into the system of Communist dictatorship.
e problem which we face here at Geneva is
the same problem that has been faced elsewhere.
It is the problem of achieving “peace” and “democ-
racy” in the historic meaning of those words.
These are alluring words, rich in their traditional
meaning. Communist propaganda has adopted
them as lures to trap the unwary. It must be re-
membered that when the Communists speak of
“peace” they mean a societ of conformity under a
single directing will. Vhen they speak of
“democracy,” they mean a “dictatorship” of the
proletariat.
The sum of the matter is this:
When we negotiate with the Soviet Communists
and their satellites, we are confronted with some-
thing far more formidable than individual or
national lust for glory. We are confronted with
a vast monolithic system which, despite its power,
believes that it cannot survive except as it suc-
ceeds in progressively destroying human freedom.
I do not present this analysis in a mood of pes-
simism, but rather in a mood of realism. Com-
munist doctrine authorizes accommodation when
the opposition is strong. It is our task here to
show such strength of honorable and nonaggres-
sive purpose that the Communists will ﬁnd it ac-
ceptable to grant unity and freedom to Korea.
Yesterday three proposals were made for the so-
lution of the problem of Korea. The Republic of
Korea and the Republic of Colombia advocated a
solution giving Vitality to the resolutions of the
United Nations with reference to the establish-
ment of a united and free Korea. .
The proposal of the North Korean Communist
regime was, however, something different. It did
not so much as mention the United Nations or its
resolutions. These, it seems, are to be treated as
nullities.
Slmllarlty to Scheme for Germany
The Communist proposal is in essence the same
as that made in June 1950 as a prelude to the armed
attack upon the Republic of Korea. Also, it is
strikingly similar to the scheme which the Soviet
Union presented at Berlin last February for the
unification of Germany.2 Conformity, you see, is
the Communist rule.
The resent Communist proposal on Korea pro-
vides t at the freely elected Government of the
Republic of Korea, representing at least three-
quarters of the Korean people, would be forced
into combination, on a basis of equality, with the
Communist regime ruling a small minority of the
peo 1e in the North.
eneral elections are proposed by the Commu-
nists under a law the terms of which would be
subject to veto by the Communist regime. The
proposal stipulates that the election conditions
should exclude all “foreign interference.” Pre-
sumably this is intended to exclude United Na-
tions supervision.
The scheme is designed to destroy the authority
of the existing Government and to replace it by a
Communist puppet regime.
The North Korean Communist proposal like-
wise requires that all foreign forces should be
withdrawn from Korean territory within 6
months. The United Nations forces would have a.
long way to go. The Chinese Communist forces
would have only a few miles to go. They could
quickly return.
The United States does not desire its troops to
remain indeﬁnitely in Korea. But we remember
that once before we had our troops in Korea and
withdrew them, as it turned out, prematurely.
We do not want that history to repeat itself.
This then is the North Korean proposal. The
United States must reject that proposal because
it does not meet the requirements of a free, uniﬁed,
and independent Korea, for which so much blood
has been expended and suffering endured.
Peace is always easy to achieve—by surrender.
Unity is also easy to achieve—by surrender. The
hard task, the task that confronts us, is to combine
peace and unity with freedom.
The people of the Republic of Korea know free-
dom, and they have fought and suffered as have
few others to preserve their freedom.
