German War Documents
Volume Released
Presa release 817 dated June 12
The honeymoon period of Nazi-Soviet collabo-
ration and the so-called “phony war” provide the
main themes for the latest volume of Documents
on German Foreign Poh'ey, 1918—1946, released
on June 19 by the Department of State. The new
volume is the eighth in the series being published
cooperatively by the American, British, and
French Governments from the archives of the
German Forei Ministry captured b Allied
forces at the c ose of World War II. t begins
with the entrance of the United Kingdom and
France into the war and ends with the invasion of
Norway immediately in the oﬂing, and bears the
subtitle: The War Y ears, September 4, 1.9.39—
March 18, 1940.
Nazi-Soviet relations bulk largest in the volume.
One hundred and eleven documents bearing di-
rectly on this subject are included in the selection.
With the defeat of Poland in September, the Ger-
mans and Soviets were led to reexamine their
a cements for the division of Poland and the
altic States, and at the end of September Rib-
bentrop made another visit to Moscow. Import-
ant reports by Ribbentrop and Hencke, a senior
German diplomat, concerning this visit are pub-
lished for the ﬁrst time. Also fully documented
for the ﬁrst time are the negotiations for the ex-
chan e of materials of war and goods between the
U.S. .R. and Germany during the winter of
1939—40. In these negotiations the Russians sur-
prised the Germans with the extent of their de-
mands and the tenacity with which the were
insisted upon. At their critical stages t e dis-
cussions were conducted by Stalin himself, with
Molotov and Mikoyan also participatin . The
minutes of these meetings give exceptiona insight
into the bargaining method of the Soviet leaders.
In the period immediately following the nego-
tiation of the Nazi-Soviet pacts the respective
spheres of inﬂuence were rigidly observed and
Germany rejected suggestions that sympathy be
expressed with the Baltic States or Finland in
their dealings with the Soviet Union. It soon
became apparent that it was Germany’s policy
not to intervene in Russian-Finnish discussions or
in the hostilities in which they resulted, but
Bliicher, the German Minister in Helsinki, on
numerous occasions protested against this policy
of his Government and urged aid to Finland.
During this period German policy toward the
neutrals had two main objectives: to counteract
the workings of the Allied blockade, and to dis-
courage the neutrals from a closer alinement with
Britain and France. These objectives are particu-
larly evident in regard to the smaller States of
Euro e, Turkey, the Middle East, Latin America,
and t e United States. At the same time Ger-
many sought to strengthen her ties with friendly
powers, particularly Italy, Japan, and Spain, and
to overcome their unconcealed misgivings about
German-Soviet collaboration.
Hitler and Ribbentrop repeatedly ex ressed
faith in the Russians and in the possibi ity of
maintaining close relations with them. In a letter
to Mussolim on March 8, 1940, Hitler wrote: “We
no longer have any reason for believin that any
Russian agency is trying to exert inﬁuence on
German domestic affairs. And to Mussolini, on
March 10, Ribbentrop said that “Stalin had re-
nounced the idea of world revolution. The Third
International, in his opinion, conﬁned itself exclu-
sively to propaganda and informational work.”
Ambassador Stohrer also had to indoctrinate
Franco with the new German line that Stalin’s
regime had changed and that “national, not inter-
national revolutionary motivations had been
decisive for the present Russian attitude.” The
Ambassador reported that his “emphatic explana-
tions seemed to give some reassurance to Franco.”
The documents here published dealing with the
United States show that close attention was aid
to American attitudes and that the German or-
eign Ministry was, in general well informed about
currents of opinion here. Several reports from
the military attaché, in which Hitler is known to
have taken particular interest, are included.
Chargé d’Aﬂ'aires Hans Thomsen at the Wash-
ington Embassy was insistent in warning a ainst
any resort to sabotage in America as in orld
War I, as this would cut the ground out from
under the isolationists whose line was that Ameri-
can interests were not involved in the European
War. Thomsen also advised against use of Ger-
man propaganda in any overt support of the isola-
tionists, as this would only encourage the will to
intervention on the part of American opinion,
which was already overwhelmingly anti-German.
The most important U.S.-German ne otiations
of the period were conducted b Under reta
of State Sumner Welles in Fe rua and Marc
1940. Documents on Welles’ talks in Berlin in-
clude Hitler’s instructions on the line to be taken
with Welles and memoranda of Welles’ conversa-
tions with Ribbentrop, State Secretary Weiz-
siicker, Goring, and Hltler himself.
The volume will be of interest not onl to his-
torians but also to persons with a genera interest
in contemporary foreign affairs.
The research on this volume has been directed
by the following editors-in-chief: For the United
States: Paul R. Sweet; for the United Kingdom:
the Hon. Margaret Lambert; for France: Pro-
fessor Maurice Baumont.
