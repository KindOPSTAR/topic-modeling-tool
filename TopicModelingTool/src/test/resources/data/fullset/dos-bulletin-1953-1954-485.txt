all possible assistance to the creation and func-
tionln of the above-mentioned all-German
committees.
Mr. Dangln to General Tlrnbarrnan, March 6
[Translation]
Referring to your letter of Februar 22, I deem
it necessary to advise on that in t e letter of
March 6 from the USS High Commissioner for
German to Mr. Conant it is pointed out that in-
ternal erman problems could be successfully
solved by all-German committees on economic and
cultural relations between Eastern and Western
Germany.
\Vith re ard to practical questions relating to
Berlin, suc 1 questions could also be settled by ap-
propriate representatives of the German authori-
ties. Soviet authorities for their part will give
every kind of assistance to the German authorities
in the settlement of these questions. Toward this
end, it is envisa ed that the occupation authorities
of the Western owers will take immediate ste 3
toward the normalization of the life of the Berlin
population, and, articularly, will take appropri-
ate measures for t e li uidation of various criminal
organizations, located in West Berlin and carrying
‘on subversive work against the German Demo-
cratic Republic, on which the Soviet authorities
have repeatedl queried the occupation authorities
of the US, UKYand France.
Ambassador Conant to Mr. Semenov, March 11
I have received your reply of March 6, 1954
to my letter of February 22 in which I proposed
to you that we should agree together with the
British and French High Commissioners in Ger-
many to eliminate immediatel a number of un-
justiﬁable obstacles which stil revent freedom
of movement between the di erent parts of
Germany.
I regret, however, that instead of replying posi-
tively to my proposals of dealing with the rac-
tical and urgent problems with which we are aced,
you have conﬁned yourself in your reply merely
to repeating M. Molotov’s proposal for all-Ger-
man committees which was rejected by the three
Western Foreign Ministers at the Berlin confer-
ence.
The matters covered by my proposal must con-
tinue closely to concern the four occupying pow-
ers until such time as the reuniﬁcation of Ger-
many takes place. None of these owers can
rightly evade its responsibilities in t at respect.
It is, therefore, the duty of the four powers to
secure the removal of obstacles to free movement
of Germans between the different parts of Ger-
many, and insofar as the continued existence of
such obstacles is due to action or inaction on the
part of the authorities in Soviet occupied terri-
tories, my government will continue to hold the
Soviet authorities responsible for this hindrance
to further pro es in the direction of German
reuniﬁcation. t is for this reason that I have
requested you, in my previous letter, to inform
me of the Soviet attitude towards the s eciﬁc
proposals which I have made and which have
offered to discuss with you.
It is clear that certain of the questions mentioned
in my letter of February 22 require only uni-
lateral decision and action by the authorities of
the Soviet Zone. These are:
(A) The abolition of the requirement for resi-
dence permits for Germans residing in the Federal
territor who desire to travel to the Soviet Zone;
(B) he removal of the prohibited zone, the
barbed wire fences and all other barriers laced
in the Soviet Zone alon the interzonal bor er;
(C) The abolition 0 all formalities regarding
movement of persons between Berlin and the
Soviet Zone.
If, as I hope, the Soviet authorities share my
government’s desire to alleviate conditions which
are oppressive to the German people, may I ask
you to indicate to me at an early date that you
are now ready to take steps to have the above
measures put into effect?
With regard to the further proposals made in
my letter of February 22, I suggest that, in every
case in which we consider it useful, discussions
should take place between German technical ex-
perts with a view to reaching practical solutions
which, once they are agreed, should become effec-
tive without delay. I shall be ready, as I have
already informed you, to furnish you with the
names of the experts authorized to deal with these
matters in res ect of \Vestern Germany who would
then meet wit 1 corresponding experts to be nom-
inated by you. If you agree with the foregoing,
I suggest that the ﬁrst step should be for us to
meet in order to draw up terms of reference which
would enable the discussions between experts to
begin at once.
General Tlmbarman to Mr. Dengln, March 17
I have the honor to refer to your letter of March
6 1954:.
,In my letter dated February 22, I asked you
to signify your agreement to put into effect six
practical measures intended to eliminate restric-
tions on free communication between the four
sectors of Berlin.
I regret to note not only that have you not
thought ﬁt to associate yourself with these prac-
tical proposals, but that you have evaded the real
issues by repeating allegations, which are devoid
of all foundation, about the existence in West
Berlin of so-called espionage organizations.
You suggest, in your reply, that “appropriate
representatives of the German authorities” should
