We are, indeed, confronted with something far
more formidable than individual or national lust
for glory and power. We are confronted with a
massive system which, despite its present power,
believes that it cannot survive except as it succeeds
in rogressively destroying human freedom. In
so oing, it is restrained by no considerations of
morality or humanity.
I do not 5 ak in a mood of pessimism. We
shall persist in our efforts to negotiate in relation
to Germany, Austria, Korea, Indochina, and
atomic energy. We know that Soviet Communist
doctrine teaches that it must be prepared to make
concessions and retreats when faced by an op-
ponent that is strong. Furthermore, we know that
the Soviet Communists’ attempt to impose their
absolute rule over 800 million captives involves
them in what, in the long run, is an impossible
task. Alread , beneath the SOlld and formidable
exterior whic despotism usually presents, there
is much unrest. For the most art it is kept con-
cealed. But there are occasionaFﬂashes that reveal
the truth. The execution of Beria, and the revolt
of the East Germans of last June, show that the
rulers fear and hate and plot a inst each other
and that the ruled are not reconciled to their fate.
Also, it may be that the very fact that the ower
of destruction is now awesome will itself lea even
the materialists to exercise restraint as a matter
of expediency.
I do not believe that a new glacial age of des-
otism is going to cree over all the world. I
elieve that freedom stil burns with a ﬁre which
cannot be extinguished. It is, however, time that
we should realize that freedom faces a most for-
midable challenge. Also, we should realize that
the survival of freedom depends not merely on the
number of the free but even more upon the in-
tensity of their faith.
We often speak as a matter of convenience about
the “free world,” meaning thereby those portions
of the world which are not now dominated by
communism. In that sense, a proximately two-
thirds of the world is “free.’ But in the free
countries, only a part of their people are inspired
by the kind of faith which alone is potent as
against the materialistic and aggressive forces of
despotism.
The future of freedom rests with a small minor-
ity of mankind. That is wh it is indispensable
that the people of our Repu lie, for their art,
should hold fast to the faith of their fathers
Just as freedom is contagious so, too, faith is
contagious. One of the best ways to keep our own
faith strong is to recall the faith of our forefathers
and to keep fresh in our minds the great deeds,
the near miracles which they wrought through
faith.
Our national history is rich in the story of men
who through faith in freedom wrought mightily.
Some of the greatest of these—George Washing-
ton, Thomas J eﬂ'erson, George Mason, and Patrick
Hen , to name but a few—worked here at Wil-
liams urg in what has become known as the “prel-
ude to independence.” It is ood that, by such
commemorations as those you old today, we re-
call their faith and works. Thus, our faith, too,
will be ke t stron and enable us, in the era in
which we ive, to p ay worthily our allotted part.

News Conference Statements by Secretary Dulles
Press releases 241, 244, 246 dated May 1L
Allegations of Diplomatlc Defeat at Geneva
At his news conference on May 11, Secretary
Dulles was asked whether he considered that he
or the United States suffered a di lomatic defeat
at Geneva. Mr. Dulles made the fbllowing reply:
I have read about that in the gross—foreign
domestic, Communist, and non- 0mmunist. f
don’t know what it is talking about. It is true
that at Geneva we have so far not achieved the
uniﬁcation of Korea, nor does it seem likely that
we will achieve the uniﬁcation of Indochina under
conditions of freedom and peace. We never
thought that there was a good chance of accom-
plishing those results. In all of these conferences,
we go into them realizing that the Communists
have a pattern of their own, which they have ap-
lied in Germany, which they have applied in
orea, which they are applyin now in In ochina.
This means that they Wlll ho d on to what they
have 0t and try to get us to acce t a scheme
whereby they can get some more. 0 keep on
trying. But I do not call it a diplomatic defeat
that we are not able to lead the Communists to
give up, as long as the don’t lead us to make any
costly concession, whic we do not intend to make.
Geneva Armletloe Proposals
Asked whether the armistice oposal put for-
ward at Geneva by the Viet M in Com/munists was
acceptable to the United States, Mr. Dulles made
the following reply:
I think very little of it because it is the same
pattern that has been applied in the past in Ger-
many, Austria, and Korea; namely, to compel a
withdrawal of the forces which sustain a free so-
ciety and to set up a system under which the Com-
munists can grab the whole area.
It is certainly unacceptable in its totality.
Whether there is any particular word or phrase
in it that is acceptable I would not want to say
