opportunity to hear explanations and to make
freely and without coercion his own choice as to
his future. The United N atious Command made
an earnest effort to explain their rights to repa-
triation to the risoners it turned over to custody
of the Neutral ations Repatriation Commission.
The United Nations Command also sought to assist
the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in
conducting ex lanations to prisoners of war for-
merly detaine by the United Nations Command.
Failure to complete explanations to more than a
minority of prisoners of war formerly detained
by the United Nations Command can only be
attributed to the stubborn refusal of the Korean
People’s Army and Chinese People’s Volunteers to
continue ex lanations except under conditions of
their own c oosing, which conditions required the
use of physical force against the prisoners of war.
Such use of force is contrary to the terms of refer-
ence, the Geneva Convention and the universally
accepted concepts of human decency and rights.
The United Nations Command supports and com-
mends the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commis-
sion and the Custodian Force, Indian, in their
refusal to use force illegally against prisoners
of war.
The United Nations side has made every effort
to convene the political conference recommended
in Paragraph 60, Armistice Agreement, and ref-
erenced in Para raph 11, Terms of Reference,
Neutral Nations atriation Commission, which
was to consider Within the speciﬁed period of
thirty days the disposition of prisoners of war.
These efforts have been thwarted by the other
side. However, as I made clear in my letter of
6 January, the plain intent of Paragraph 11 of
the Terms of Reference is to prevent either party
to the agreement from frustrating the basic pur-
pose of avoiding indeﬁnite captivity for the
prisoners.
For the United NatiOns Command now to agree
to further and indeﬁnitely prolonged captivity
of these prisoners of war would negate the very
principle of human rights for which so many men
of this command have fought and died. Such
unjust and unworthy action is intolerable to any
free people, and is obviously unthinkable. The
United Nations Command agreed to the Terms
of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation
Commission only because they included a prohi-
bition against enforced repatriation, and made
clear provisions for the ﬁnal release of prisoners
of war to civilian status 120 days after being
placed in the custody of the Neutral Nations Re-
patriation Commission.
I reiterate the unalterable conviction of the
United Nations Command that the Neutral Na-
tions Repatriation Commission has a solemn obli-
gation to fulﬁll its responsibilities and release to
civilian status at 23 January all prisoners of war
who have refused repatriation. Failure of the
Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to ful-
ﬁll this obligation would be a deliberate avoidance
of an im rtant element of the Terms of Reference
and the nited Nations Command could not con-
cur in an action constituting default by the Neu-
tral Nations Re atriation Commission.
The United ations Command cannot accept
custod of these risoners of war in accordance
with t e terms 0 our proposal. However, in
view of your state! intention to release unilat-
erally the risoners of war starting 20 January,
the Uniteleations Command must necessarily be
prepared to arrange for their accommodation and
disposition. In processing these personnel, after
they leave the demilitarized zone, it must be clearly
understood that we do so out of re ard for hu-
manitarian consideration and in or er to insure
the prisoners the fullest possible continued enjoy-
ment of the beneﬁts the agreement was desi ed
to assure to them. The United Nations om-
mand, in accordance with the a reement on pris-
oners of war, will honor its 0 1i ation to treat
them as fully entitled to their free om as civilians
on 23 January. You are alread aware of the
detailed plans for processin Wiich have been
made by the United Nations ommand. The re-
turn to the United Nations Command of personnel
prior to 230001 January can only be regarded as
a failure by the Neutral Nations Repatriation
Commission fully to discharge its duties, but this
failure will in no way, it must be emphasized,
affect the ri ht of prisoners of war to become
civilians at t iat time regardless of their physical
location.
Accordingly, I have instructed the Command-
ing General, Eighth United States Arm , to ad-
just his present plans to permit handing and
rocessing of personnel beginning 20 January.
Tile will, as a matter of priority, make the neces-
sary arrangements with you.
