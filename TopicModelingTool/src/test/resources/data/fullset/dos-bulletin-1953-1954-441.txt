self-respectin international relationships. That
is what our aﬁies want. Trade, broader markets,
and a ﬂow of investment are far more healthy than
intergovernmental grants-in-aid. It is, of course,
important that we do actually develo these mu-
tually advantageous substitutes for “aid.” To do
so is one of the major objectives of the Eisenhower
administration. It is an essential component of
the overall policies already described.
In the ways outlined, the United States and its
allies gather strength for the long-term defense
of freedom.
Our National Purpose
We do not, of course, claim to have found some
magic formula that insures against all forms of
Communist successes. Despotism is entrenched as
never before. It remains aggressive, particularly
in Asia. In Europe, its purposes remain expan-
sive, as shown by Mr. Molotov’s plans at the Ber-
lin conference for Germany, Austria, and all Eu-
rope. However, time and fundamentals will
work for us, if only we will let them.
The dictators face an impossible task when they
set themselves to suppress, over a vast area and
for a long time, the opportunities which ﬂow from
freedom. \Ve can be sure that there is going on,
even within the Soviet Empire, a silent test of
strength between the powerful rulers and the
multitudes of human beings. Each individual
seems by himself to be helpless in this struggle.
But their aspirations in the aggregate make up a
mighty force. There are some signs that the
Soviet rulers are, in terms of domestic policy,
bending to some of the human desires of their peo-
ple. There are promises of more food, more
household goods, more economic freedom. This
does not prove that the dictators have themselves
been converted. It is rather that they may be
dimly perceiving that there are limits to their
power indeﬁnitely to suppress the human spirit.
That is a truth which should not be lost sight of
as we determine our own policies. Our national
purpose is not merely to survive in a world fraught
with appalling danger. We want to end this era
of danger. We shall not achieve that result
merely by developing a vast military establish-
ment. That serves indispensany to defend us
and to deter attack. But the sword of Damooles
remains suspended. The way to end the peril
peacefully is to demonstrate that freedom pro-
duces not merely guns, but the spiritual, intel-
lectual, and material richness that all men want.
Such are the guiding principles we invoke. We
have conﬁdence that if our Nation perseveres in
applying them, freedom will again win the upper
hand in its age-long struggle with despotism, and
that the danger of war will steadily recede.
Foreign Policy and
National Security
Statement by Secretary Dulles1
I am glad to discuss with you the present state
of our foreign policy and its relation to our mili-
tary programs. I
The central goal of our policy is co with
freedom and security. The menace of oviet bloc
despotism, which now holds in its grip one-third
of the world’s peoples, presents the most serious
danger that has ever confronted us. The main
aspects of this threat are apparent.
1. The Soviet rulers seem to feel secure only in
a world of conformity dominated by them.
Partly, no doubt, they are driven by lust for power.
But to a considerable extent, I believe, they are
driven by fear of freedom. To them freedom is a
threat to be stamped out wherever it approaches
their world.
2. The Soviet bloc possesses what is in many
ways the most formidable military establishment
the world has ever known. Its great stren h is
manpower, but also it is stron in terms of p anes,
submarines, and atomic capa ilities. This vast
empire dominates the central Eurasian land mass
extending from the River Elbe in Germany to the
Paciﬁc. From within an orbit of 20,000 miles, it
could strike by land at any one of approximately
20 states of Europe, the Middle East, and Asia,
and by air it could strike the North American
Continent.
3. Nor is the threat only military. It also com-
mands a political apparatus which operates in
every countr of the world, seeking to capitalize
upon all of t e discontents and unsatisﬁed ambi-
tions which inevitably exist in greater or less
degree throughout the free world.
4. The threat is virtually unlimited so far as
time is concerned. Soviet communism 0 rates
not in terms of an individual lifetime so t at the
threat will end with someone’s death. It operates
in terms of what Lenin and Stalin called “an
entire historical era.”
II
To meet that military threat requires on our
side a strategy which is both well-conceived and
well-implemented. This military defense must be
within the ca acity of the free world to sustain
it for an inde ite time without such im airment
of its economic and social fabric as wou d expose
it to piecemeal seizure from within by the po-
litical apparatus of communism.
This calls for thinking and planning which is
imaginative; which takes maximum possible ad~
