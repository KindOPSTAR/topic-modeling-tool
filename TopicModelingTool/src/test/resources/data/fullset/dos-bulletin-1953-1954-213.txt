such a program high riority should be given to
the elimination of bi ateral and discriminatory
trade and exchange techniques which strike at
the very core of international com tition and cur-

for further and continuing advances toward the
general reduction of trade restrictions, as agreed
to and already begun under existing international
agreements. At the same time, barriers to the

STATEMENT OF JANUARY 28
Press release 47 dated February 3
Mr. President, when we adjourned yesterda
evening, I had a sense of complete recall—recall
to those days in 1945 when I gained a reat ad—
miration for your skill as a diplomat. n a book
I wrote 4 years a o, I paid tribute to Mr. Molo-
tov’s di lomatic siill. I am glad to see that he
has not 0st his touch.
Yesterday Mr. Molotov produced out of his hat
rabbits for all of us: Peace in Korea, peace in
Indochina, an end to the armaments race, the
abolition of atomic weapons, the end of tension
everywhere throughout the world by the paciﬁc
settlement of all the disputes which rage through-
out the world, and a tremendous increase in
economic prosperity.
. These achievements were all to be made possible
if only we were to invite Mr. Chou En-lai to come
here and sit down with us. That fact, Mr. Molo-
tov implied, would automatically satisfy the aspi-
rations for peace and welfare which men have had
throughout all the ages. Who is this Chou En-
lai whose addition to our circle would make os-
sible all that has for so long seemed impossi 1e?
He is a leader of a regime which gained de facto
power on the China mainland through bloody
war, which has liquidated millions of Chinese as
the only means of maintaining its powers; which

movement of rivate capital should be removed, so
that it ma p ay a fuller role in developing new
sources 0 materials, creating new productive
facilities, and contributing to an increase in stand-
ards of living throughout the free world.
The Administration is now intensively engaged

Foreign Economic Policy. On the basis of this
study a comprehensive program will be presented
to the Congress for action.
so diverts the economic resources of its impover-
ished people to military efforts that they starve by
the millions; which became an open aggressor in
Korea and was so adjudged by the United Na-
tions; which promotes aggression in Indochina by
training and equipping the aggressors and sup-
plyin them with vast amounts of war munitions.
Suc is the man whose presence Mr. Molotov
urges would enable them to gain lasting peace and
mounting prosperity.
In my opening remarks I said that the United
States recognizes the fact of evil, but that we do
not take it to our breast and call it good. That
is precise] what Mr. Molotov proposes we should
do with tliis source of so much human misery.
There is within each of our countries an intense
lon ing for the peace and prosperity which Mr.
Mo otov so artfully portrayed. But there also
remains, I believe, some capacity to assert our
reason and some willin ess to supply moral prin-
ciples. ()ur reason te ls us that Mr. Molotov’s
portrayal is the portrayal of an illusion. Our
moral sense forbids the relationship which he
pro oses.
r. Molotov’s proposal, when viewed in the
cold light of the morning after, consists in effect of
holding out to all the world the hopes which were
entertained when the United Nations was formed
and saying in effect that those hopes can now be
realized through establishing a council of ﬁve, in-
cluding Communist China. Mr. Molotov would
transfer to this council all of the essential tasks
of the United Nations.
He chided us for assuming that his proposal
merely involved the council in dealing with ques-
tions of political character. He explained that
his roposal went far beyond that. Not only
won (1 he have the council deal with all of the
political problems of the world, but also with
problems of a military nature, of an economic na-
