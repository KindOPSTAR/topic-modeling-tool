geography, and other factors which make it al-
most unbridgeable at best—has been made wider
by the deliberate use of distortion and the “big
lie” as a major tactical weapon b the Kremlin.
Words which we acce t as truthful’expressions of
a nation’s policy lose t eir meaning in Moscow and
actions have no relation to words. In my 30 odd
years in this profession, I have always believed
that the most effective diplomacy, as well as the
most honorable, is to say exactl what you mean;
to lay our cards face up on the table. That is
recise what my Government does. The late
arshal7 Stalin, whom I met at several confer-
ences, however, had different ideas. “A diplo-
mat’s word,” he once said, “must have no relation
to actions, otherwise what kind of diplomacy is it?
Words are one thing, actions another. Good
words are masks for concealment of bad deeds.
Sincere diplomacy is no more possible than dry
water or wooden iron.”
We abhor such concepts. They are as forei
to our philoso by and to our way of life as t e
vast steppes w ich nourished them.
The American character and the nature of Soviet
aggression were, in my opinion, dominant factors
leading toward our cooperation with other na-
tions. This cooperation, it is true, was not imme-
diate. We did withdraw our forces from abroad
immediately after the last war. War weary, and
hoping for the best, we wished to resume the ways
of peace and to have our men back home. But
the situation in Europe was desperate, as I am sure
everyone in this audience knows. It was impera-
tive, as the American people realized, for the
United States to assume a position, however re-
luctantly, of leadership among the nations.
We need time to grow accustomed to this lead-
ership and to our responsibilities. The Great
Powers of Europ the Dutch, the British, the
French, the Spanish, had many years in which to
evolve their roles of leading the world and to ha-
bituate themselves to their international respon-
sibilities of the period. The tempo of the times
was inﬁnitely slower; events developed in leisurely
fashion. Policy was formed by the few and ac-
cepted by the many. It is quite different now when
pressure is constant and the s eed of events fan-
tastical] swift. What is sai or done in Wash-
ington, ondon, Moscow, or Tokyo is known in
minutes b millions around the world. The im-
pact, for etter or for worse, of the marvels of
today’s telecommunications has revolutionized the
whole ﬁeld of human psychological relationships.
This, and the staggering complexities of life in the
modern world have rendered vastly more difﬁcult
our quick transition and acclimation to a role of
leadership. And quite frankly it seems to me we
have made good progress.
But we have also had our frustrations: the K0-
rean War was confusing to many Americans. We
looked back with longing to the good old days
when whatever happened beyond the shores of
our continent, however grave for others, need
hardly 5 oil the ﬂavor of our breakfast eggs and
coffee. e were, at ﬁrst, not suiﬁcientl aware of
Korea’s implications, of the reasons w 1y we had
to act as we did; and the ﬁghting dragged on in-
terminabl . The great question was ‘ Why don’t
we ﬁnish it”? But it became apparent to civilian
and soldier alike that we fou ht for a deﬁnite and
vital objective—to prevent t e creeping enslave-
ment of our world and the annihilation of our way
of life. we fought in Korea, as did you, in order
not to ﬁght some day in Kansas City or again in
Arnhem.
So fundamentally and basically the American
people have given wholehearted support to the
very practical theory that they must live and work
toget er in concert with other nations of a. simi-
lar mind. In so doing they have, I think, resisted
to an unusual degree the very natural temptation
of trying to make their own ideas predominate.
They realize that each nation from its culture,
tradition, and history can and does contribute its
ifdeas and its strength to keeping the free world
ree.
Postwar Partlclpatlon In Free World Ettort
You know well of our cooperation during World
War II. Let me mention brieﬂy some of the ma-
jor ste s we have taken to cooperate with others
since t 1e war: our participation in the United N a-
tions, in the valiant resistance of Greece to Com-
munist invasion and in _su port of our Turkish
ally, in the Marshall plan, in the North Atlantic
Treaty, in the Korean struggle, in the challenging
gomt 4 program, our Slapplort of the European
efense Community, an nall our President’s
recent proposals for the peace
energy.
First, we joined with other countries in the es-
tablishment of the United Nations, the formation
of which was a truly great historical event. De-
spite all the disappointments since the San Fran-
cisco conference, we should continue to bear in
mind that the United Nations represents a sincere
and honest attempt to join the nations of the world
together for the supreme objective of keeping the
peace. If public expectations of its early powers
of persuaswn were unfortunately exaggerated, it
has nonetheless proved to be the most useful forum
of our postwar era in which the forces of public
opinion can best be brought to bear on the many
problems of our day.
In the economic sphere we have cooperated and
will continue to cooperate with our allies. The
Marshall plan is so familiar to you all that it re-
quires no emphasis on my part. Sufﬁce it to say
that the money expended has borne good fruit.
Especially, is that true in this country. I like to
think that by this assistance we have repaid the
loan you made in 1782 to John Adams, who, by
appointment from the Continental Congress, was
