pose democracy on several of our neighbors. We
have yet to succeed, regardless of the methods we
used. Intervention has understandably come to
be a nasty word in Latin America, and experience
has demonstrated that the best wa to destroy
democracy in Latin America is to see to promote
it by butting into the affairs of our sister republics.
Do we in the United States like foreigners to
pontiﬁcate about our domestic aﬂ'airsl Do ou
think that better racial relations would be ur-
thered in the United States by the interference
of forei overnments’? Your Government has
learned its esson, but uite a few of your fellow
citizens haven’t. The atter seem to for et that
our Latin friends don’t feel half as strongfy about
dictators as we do; three South American presi-
dents now in oﬁice were freely chosen in elections
held b their olitical opponents despite the fact
that a 1 three ad previously served as dictators.
I do not mean that there is nothing we can do
to promote democracy in Latin America. \Vithout
butting in we can do much to help build the foun-
dations on which democracy must rest. Democ-
racy must grow; it cannot be imposed. And
through our technical cooperation we can promote
its growth. By combating illiteracy, by improv-
ing health, by giving even the poorest something
more than the bare means of subsistence, by inter-
esting everyone in civic affairs, by awakening
pride in national pro ress, by giving hope to the
oor, the weak, and t e o pressed, we can truly
urther democracy better t an by interventions or
moral lectures. That is the meaning of our point
4 work.
The other criticism—that our principal interest
in Latin America must be to defend our property
interests and cons uently the status quo—simply
overlooks the facteltlhat Latin America is in a e-
riod of rapid and inevitable social change. e
could do no greater disservice to our pro erty
interests than to disregard that fact, to te the
people of Latin America in effect that our pro erty
interests stand in the way of their nationa and
personal as irations for betterment. My own
profound be ief is that American investments can
and will help our sister nations to realize their
aspirations. Men can have only what they pro-
duce, and the amount the produce will not be
determined primarily by t eir skill, their brawn,
their intelligence—it will be determined by the
tools, the capital the have to help them produce.
To our sister repub ics we can provide not only
capital but know-how. Better t an by laws and
treaties our capital will be protected by a belief
in the nations where it is invested that it is there
to their beneﬁt, not to their hurt.
l'llgh Collber o! Forelgn Servlce
When you hear criticisms of our Foreign Serv-
ice, I hope you will bear in mind all of these
factors I have described in deciding how much
March 8, I954
weight to give them. I could tell you man tales,
even personal ones, of people in our oreign
Service under ﬁre or bombing raids in war or
revolution, crossin perilous seas or skies, or
serving amidst pestilence, ﬂood, hurricane, earth-
quake, or many other kinds of bodily peril. In
landing our ﬁghting services, let us not forget
that our civilian Foreign Service must face many
perils too. I have read with indignation stories
implyin our Foreign Service rides “Uncle Sam’s
Grav 'frain” because I know some of the many
sacri ces our Foreign Service has made to serve
our country; I know the selfless, unsparing de-
votion it has given to our country’s ﬁrst line of
defense. It is important that our Foreign Serv-
ice be a disciplined, dedicated body pre ared to
meet any situation. But today, more t an men
of physical courage, we need men of intellectual
integrity.
Until recentl we have had su erb material
from which to c oose our Foreign ervice, but to-
day the supply is drying up. Many promising
young candidates are simply not dis osed to
undergo unrestrained sni mg from t e home
front. Unless this trend is revised, irreparable
injur may be done our national interests with-
out t e American public even bein aware of it.
Ex erts in handlin foreign affairs cannot be
trained overnight, es ite some brilliant am-
ateurs we have had in t e ﬁeld. And we should
never forget that it ma be years, when the oﬁi-
cers now entering the oreign Service are reach-
ing the top, before we shall know whether those
being picked today are capable of shouldering
the immense burdens of our foreign relations
tomorrow.
I fervently hope therefore, that the American
people, their electe representatives, and the press
will show forbearance in criticizing our country’s
representatives abroad. \Ve welcome construc-
tive criticism; we are acutely aware in the per- '
plexities which face us that we are not infallible;
we know that democracy is a healthy form of
government precisely because no one is immune
from criticism; but we do ask our fellow citizens
to consider what they are doing to their own in-
terests by applauding wanton attacks on their
Foreign Service. In few walks of life do so
few have so much to do for so many. Upon the
skill and experience of those men and women de-
pends in substantial measure the success of our
foreign policy—our peace, prosperity, security,
our very national existence.
If diplomats occasionally make mistakes, their
very caution generally saves them from irre-
trievable blunders. It is diﬂicult for them to
chart the Nation’s course if they are distracted
by a continuous uproar of misguided, contradic-
tory criticism. It is not a question of individuals;
it is a question of your Foreign Service, which,
like your armed services, is an essential element
