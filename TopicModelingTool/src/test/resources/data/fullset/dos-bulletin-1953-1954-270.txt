1953, particularly with the problems involving
the Anglo-Eg ptian Sudan and the Suez Base.
Secretary Dul es, in his survey of the problems of
foreign olicy on Januar 27, made articular
note of t 1e importance of the Suez Cana as a sea-
way “which made it possible for Europe to be in
communication with Asia” and referred to the
ditiiculties between the United Kingdom and
Egypt concerning its control and defense.”
ter long ne otiations, the United Kingdom
and Egypt, on ﬁi‘ebruar 12, 1953, reached an
agreement concernin sel -determination and self-
government for the udan.” The agreement pro-
vided: (1) an early election for an all-Sudanese
Parliament, supervised by a Mixed Electoral Com-
mission composed of seven members (three Suda-
nese, one British, one E ptian, one American
and, as Chairman, an Indian) ; (2) a transitional
riod of full self-government of not more than
years, in order to enable the Sudanese people
to exercise their self-determination in a free and
neutral atmosphere; (3) a special committee to
complete the “Sudanization” of the Administra-
tion, the Police, the Sudan Defense Force, etc.,
within the three-year period; (4) election of a
Constituent Assembly to decide the future status
of the Sudan and to prepare a constitution; (5)
a decision on the future of the Sudan (a) by the
Constituent Assembly choosing to link the Sudan
with Egypt in any form or (b) by the Constituent
Assembly choosing complete independence.
Secretary Dulles con ratulated Foreign Secre-
tary Eden and Foreign inister Mahmoud F awzi
on February 14 concernin the agreement as to
the Sudan.” He believed t at the settlement was
one which the British, the Egyptian and the
Sudanese peoples could view “with equal satis-
faction as appropriate to their respective inter-
ests, and as providing a solid foundation for
friendly, mutually beneﬁcial future relationships.”
Moreover, the Secretary thought the accord might
well be “the ﬁrst step toward the establishment
of more fruitful associations in an area of critical

importance to the security of the free world.”
In 1 fr. Dulles’ view, the resolution of this diiiicult
problem went far toward creating “an atmosphere
of mutual understanding and trust in the Near
East” which could “only result in reat beneﬁts
for all the nations of the free world. ’
Foreign Secreta Eden declared on Febru-
ary 17 that “compete independence” included
the right of the Sudanese to choose any form of
association with any other state “on achieving
self-determination.” It may be noted that the
elections, which were held in November 1953, gave
a majority in the bicameral Sudanese Parliament
to the pro-Egyptian National Unionist Party.
No solution was reached, however, in the Suez
Base ne otiations, which were renewed in April
1953, alt tough the area of controversy ap ared
to be narrowed by the end of the year. Q'srime
Minister Churchill, in a statement in the House
of Commons on December 17, noted that formal
negotiations with Egypt had ceased, although in-
formal discussions had not. Among other things,
he said:
Naturally, we do not wish to keep indeﬁnitely 80,000
men, at a cost of perhaps over “0.000.010 [SHJLHXLWO]
a year, discharging a duty which has larucly fallen on us
and us alone of safeguarding the interests of the free na-
tions in the Middle East and preserving the international
waterway, the Suez Canal. . . .
We remain convinced that it is in our interest, military
and ﬁnancial, to procure the redeployment of our forces
in North Africa and the Middle East.
Our action will be based on a careful study of the
merits of the problem and the solution will not be dictated
either by the violence of our foreign enemies or the pres-
sure of some of our best friends.
Meanwhile, on Jul 23, the ﬁrst anniversary of
Egypt’s Liberation a , President Eisenhower
sent a message to Presi ent Naguib, in which he
expressed the view that Egypt now had “the op-
portunity of fulfilling its destiny of strengthenin
the peace and stability of the Middle East an
thereby contributing to the welfare of mankind.” "°
