launched and nine delivered. Details of the com-
Elete programme for 1952 are shown at Appendix
. In addition 239 commissions for repairs and
reﬁtting were carried out.
The year under review saw the virtual comple-
tion of the shipbuilding programme laid down
in 1950. Ne rotiations were therefore opened with
the Italian (zovernment with a view to ensuring
a continuation of work for the Zone’s shi )yards.
The programme decided upon envisages the con-
struction during 1953—1954 of two ships for Lloyd
Triestino, the construction of up to 45,000 tons of
lar e tankers or cargo vessels of over 10,000 tons,
an of up to 8,000 tons of smaller vessels of less
than 2,000 tons. In addition, a tug is to be built
for the Captain of the Port. 200 million lire
has been set aside for ship repairs.
Section lV—Labour
During 1952 the number of registered emplo ed
decreased from 90,575 in January to 89,058 in De~
cember, a trend that was partly reﬂected in an
increase in the number of registered unemployed
from 18.852 to 19,185 over the same period. This
movement was due chiefly to a decline in the num-
ber of persons attending re-qualiﬁcation courses
and work-relief schemes.
The total number of work permits issued to
Italian citichs coming from outside the Zone was
1.477 on 31 December 1952 compared with 1,785
on 31 December 1951. The number of such per-
mits issued to aliens showed a similar decrease.
Most of these were for building operatives.
A total of 182 strikes were called during the year
involving 209,000 workers and the loss of 627,269
working hours.
It is estimated that wage adjustments obtained
by about 75 per cent of the registered em loyed
more than offset the slight rise in the cost of living.
“'orkers in both industry and commerce beneﬁtted
from an increase in real wages of between 3 per
cent and 8 per cent.
The introduction of a new establishment for the
Commune of Trieste, and the application to em-
ployees of local bodies of pay mcreases alread
granted to statal employees, were discussed wit
the Italian Government in June and agreed in
principle.
A sample survey of the labour force covering
3,530 families in the Commune of Trieste and 284
families in the smaller communes, was carried out
during the week 8—15 March. Some results of
this survey, compared with ﬁgures obtained in
March 1951, are s iown at Appendix H.
Soctlon V—Publlc Works
The budget for the Department of Public
“'orks and Utilities for 1952 amounted to 5,286
million lire. Housing was again the principle
item, accounting for nearly 50 per cent of the
total.
re-qualiﬁcation courses, 18
sewers, 12 per cent: public uildings, including
schools and hospitals, 8 per cent. A loan of 300
million lire was granted to a )ower company in
order to secure continuity of t 1e supply of elec-
tric )ower to the Commune of Trieste.
Ot ier important Public Works carried out
during the year included the continuation of work
on a secondary school and a reformatory, the ini-
tiation of work on a new settlement for refugees,
and the extensive repair and resurfacing of roads
by hot bituminization.
Details of the housing programme, showing the
number of apartments constructed during 1952
compared with previous years and the extent to
which they were ﬁnanced by the Allied Military
Government are given at Appendix I.
Other major items were: Work relief and

Traflic through the Port of Trieste during 1952
again showed an overall increase. A total of 6.9
million tons was handled compared with 6.6 mil-
lion tons in 1951, and 5.4 million tons in 1938.
This increase was wholl accounted for by move-
ment of goods by sea w ich rose by 340,000 tons
compared with 1951, whereas movement by rail
decreased by nearly 70,000 tons.
Traﬁic was again most intense during the early
part of the year, with a decided falling off in the
ast quarter. The lowest monthly ﬁgure recorded
was 411,000 tons in December. Goods handled
followed the same pattern as in recent years, the
bulk being formed by Austrian timber for the
Levant and crude mineral oils from Syria and
Lebanon. Competition from the North Sea Ports,
to which reference was made in my last report con-
tinued, and was principally responsible for the
decline in rail trafﬁc. Of particular signiﬁcance
Was the decision taken on the initiative of the Ger-
man Railways at a Conference held in Linz in
November, to terminate tariff agreements regulat-
in traﬁic to and from Austria.
rade with Yugoslavia increased, monthly im-
ports through the frontier clearing account
amounting to an average of 78 million lire and
exports to 47 million lire, an increase over 1951 of
18 per cent and 19 per cent respectively. The
principal items imported were livestock, timber
and fish. Exports included machine tools, elec-
trical equipment, fruits and rice. Imports from
the Yugoslav Zone of the Free Territory, at a
monthly average of 63 million lire, showed an
increase of 31 per cent as compared with 1951, and
exports at a monthly average of 52 million lire, an
increase of 66 per cent. These ﬁgures exclude
charges for the hospitalization of Yugoslav Zone
patients in Trieste hospitals which amounted to
approximately 15 million lire during the year.
