are below domestic prices and imports are arriving
in tlie United States at below the support price
eve .
The Secretary of Agriculture states that in the
absence of im ort restrictions and in view of the
existing supp y-demand conditions for tung oil
as indicated in his Department’s preliminary in-
vestigation, it appears practically certain that for-
eign tung oil will continue to be imported in large
quantities, and U.S. prices will continue below
support levels. He s. s that these large imports
of tung oil replace U.S. tung oil in domestic uses
and force the domestic tung oil under price sup-
port and eventual acquisition by the Government.
The result, he believes, is that the price support
program objectives of enabling producers to mar-
et their crops in an orderly manner throu h reg-
ular trade channels, at prices at least equagto the
effective support level, will not be achieved; and
that unrestrlcted imports of below-support-price
tun oil will render ineffective or materially in-
ter ere with the price support operation and re-
duce substantially the amount of products proc-
essed from domestic tung oil.
Accordingly, I direct that the Tariff Commis-
sion make an immediate investigation of this mat-
ter in accordance with Executive Order No. 7233,
dated November 23, 1953, promulgating regula-
tions covering investigations under Section 22 of
the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended.
The investigation and report of ﬁndings and rec-
ommendations of the Tariff Commission should
be completed as promptly as practicable.
The Tariﬁ Commission, in its investigation,
shall determine whether tung oil and tung nuts
are being or are practically certain to be imported
under such conditions and in such quantities as to
render or tend to render ineffective or materially
interfere with the price support program for tung
nuts or tung oil, or to reduce substantially the
amount of products processed in the United States
from domestic tung nuts or tung oil.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Import Duties on Scissors
not To Be Increased
White House press release dated May 11
The President on May 11 declined to accept the
recommendations of the United States Tariff Com-
mission for a doubling of the duty on the imports
of certain ty es of scissors and shears.
The Tarifprommission had made an investiga-
tion of the effect of the trade agreement conces-
sions on the domestic scissors and shears industry,
ursuant to section 7 of the Trade Agreements
nsion Act. In its report, a majority of Com-
mission members found that scissors and shears
are being imported into this country in such in-
creased quantities as to threaten serious injury
to the domestic industry producing like or directly
competitive products.1
The President, in identical letters to Sen. Eu-
gene D. Millikin, Chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, and Rep. Daniel A. Reed, Chairman
of the House Ways and Means Committee, indi-
cated that he did not feel that the evidence pre-
sented established conclusively that imports of
scissors and shears threaten serious injury to the
domestic industr . The President questioned the
adequacy of the data presented to the Commission,
accounting only for a little more than one-third of
domestic production. He also pointed out that
imports, after reaching their high point in 1952,
have leveled oﬂ“ since then, with the rate during
1953 and early 1954 somewhat below that of 1952.
The President, in commenting on the Commis-
sion’s decision to recommend action on the basis
of threatened rather than actual injury, said he
believed that “when this provision of the law is
invoked, the evidence brought forth to substantiate
the judgment of threat must be of such a character
as to leave no doubt that actual injur is immi-
nent.” The President stated that in t e resent
instance he is not persuaded that the evi ence is
of such a character.
Text of the Presldent's Letter
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: I have carefully consid-
ered the report of the United States Tariﬂ" Com-
mission, dated March 12 1954, regardino' its
investigation ursuant to Section 7 of the Trade
Agreements xtension Act of 1951 with respect
to certain types of scissors and shears.
The question of injury is reported to arise in
the case of imported SCISSOI‘S and shears (other
than runing and sheep shears) valued at more
than 1.75 per dozen. The Tariﬁ' Commission is
unanimous 1n ﬁnding that there is no present seri-
ous injury to the domestic industry from imports
but, by a divided vote, ﬁnds a likelihood of such
injury in the future.
In my opinion, the evidence resented has not
sufﬁciently established that the domestic industry
is subject to serious injury from importations,
either present or prospective, to warrant my ap-
proving the recommendation of the majorit of
the Commission for a doubling of the duty, w ich
now aﬁ'ords an average protection of 42 per cent
ad valorem.
The domestic plants reducin scissors and
shears turn out a broadly iversiﬁe line of goods,
from sewing scissors to barbers’ shears. The cate-
gory of imports upon which this doubling of duty
is suggested comprises 94 per cent of the total
1Copies of the Tariff Commission report may be ob-
tained from the United States Tariﬂ! Commission, Wash-
ington 25, D. 0.
