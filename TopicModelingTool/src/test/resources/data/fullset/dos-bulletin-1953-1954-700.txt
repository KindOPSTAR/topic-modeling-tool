Deals With Far East
Press release 201 dated April 16
The Department of State released on April 24
Foreign Relations 0 the United States, 1936', Vol-
ume IV, The Far at. This volume is divided
into three main sections: The Far Eastern Crisis,
China, Japan. There is also a short section on
Siam (Thailand).
Reports on conditions in the Far East which
form a background for the later outbreak of war
comprise the major portion of this volume, both
in space and interest. Direct negotiations be-
tween the United States and Far Eastern govern-
ments in 1936 were of relative] minor im ortance
save for those connected with apan’s wit drawal
from the London Naval Conference which are not
covered by the present volume having been re-
corded in Foreign Relations, 1936', Volume 1, Gen-
eral, The British Commonwealth and Foreign
Relations, Japan, 1981—1941, Volume I. _
While 1936 was a period of relative inactivity
in Japan’s extension of ower in China, American
diplomats were not In] ed into any delusion that
Japanese aggressive aims were ended. Early in
the year reports of a possible Japanese proposed
nonaggression pact brought forth evaluations of
the situation. “There is no evidence locally that
the Japanese intended to abandon their plans achieve a portion of domination on the Asiatic
Continent, and particularly in China,” tele-
raphed Ambassador Nelson T. Johnson from
eiping on January 9. He stated: “The Japa-
nese are proceeding with their eyes open and have
thrown into the discard the League Covenant, the
Nine Power Treaty and the Kellogg Pact in order
to be free to carry out their policy.” (pp. 5-6)
Ambassador Joseph C. Grew in a telegram of
January 9 expressed his view that the determina-
tion of the J a anese to dominate North China was
no less strong ut that they visualized aining this
end without military occupation. 7) Am-
bassador Johnson commented further on January
15. (pp. 11—14) Referring to Italy, Germany,
and Japan he expressed his belief that “nothing
but force, economic or physical, seems to be ade
quate to meet the kind 0 force which these powers
naturally believe in and are ready to use.” (p. 13)
Ambassador Grew’s more detailed observations
were 'ven on February 7. pp. 4249) He ac-
cepte as a premise that in orth China. at least
nothin but defeat in war could prevent Japanese
contro and also that the Japanese expansionist
movement would interfere progressively with
American rights. While he favored exploring
every avenue for a political agreement, he urge
as of primary importance the maintenance of an
adequate navy for the defense of American rights
and mterests. This report concludes with a state-
ment of perhaps neral application as well as to
the situation to w ich it was immwiately applied:
We should not lose eight 01' the fact, deplorable but
true, that no practical and effective code of international
morality upon which the world can rely has yet been dis-
covered. and that the standards of morality of one nation
in certain given circumstances have little or no relation
to the standards of another nation in other circumstances,
and little or no relation to the standards of the individuals
or the nations in question. To shape our foreign policy
on the unsound theory that other nations are guided and
bound by our own present standards of international
ethics would be to court sure disaster. (Pp- 48-49)
Ambassador Grew on A ril 3O submitted a re-
port _on the two schools 0 thought in Japan re-
glnrding expansion, the “continental school” and
e “oceanic” or “blue water school.” The latter
was favored by the navy. (pp. 129—134) He re-
ported “a marked recrudescence of opinion in
recent months favoring the southward expansion
theory.” (p. 130)
In its review on July 3 of the ﬁrst half of 1936
(pp. 231—236), the Embassy in China reported
‘ intensiﬁcation of the resolve of Japanese military
to extend J a anese economic, military, and per-
ha spolitica control in China.” (p. 231
r. Stanley K. Hornbeck, Chief of the ivision
of Far Eastern Affairs, wrote in a memorandum
of August 8 (pp. 264—266) that “the Japanese
militarists have embarked on a course of
imperialistic expansion the rincipal instrument
of which is armed force.” e spoke of a ring of
defense armaments but considered China, the
Philippines, and the Netherlands East Indies as
the weakest points in the ring. (p. 265)
The Embassy in China in its report of January
12, 1937 (pp. 453—458), expressed the opinion
that the events of the second half of 1936 had
strengthened China’s position and even caused
“the Ja anese, at least temporarily, to ado t a
decided y less aggressive policy towards China.”
(p. 453)
Two dramatic incidents of especial signiﬁcance,
one in Japan and one in China, are re rted on at
length in this volume. The ﬁrst was t e outbreak
by an army u who on Februa 26 assassinated
a number 0 hig Japanese oiiicia s. (pp. 719 if.)
The second was the detention by force of Chiang
Kai-shek at Sian, December 12—25, to bring pres-
sure upon him for leading united Chinese resist-
ance to Japan. (pp. 414 if.) It may be noted,
however, that both Ambassador Johnson and
Counselor Willys R. Peck had reported in October
that the Chinese Government and Chiang were
prepared to meet Japanese force with force. (pp.
358, 364) The Sian aﬁair did, however, appar-
ently mark an important step in bringing about
a “common front.” The Embassy described the
reported alliance between the mutineers and the
Communists as a “very regrettable aftermath of
the Sian coup.” (p. 455)
Reports of special interest on Communist activi-
ties in China are those by Ambassador Johnson
on March 3 (pp. 68—72) and by Counselor Peck
on April 17 (pp. 112-113).
