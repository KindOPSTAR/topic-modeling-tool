Departmental Inspection Service
Department Circular 95 dated April 15
I have established the function of inspection of the
Department and of the Foreign Service in the Bureau of
Inspection, Security, and Consular Affairs. I wish it to
operate as a necessary extension of my ofﬁce and to pro-
vide a means of closer communication between myself and
all my associates in the Department of State, at home and
abroad.
The Department has had for many years, of course, a
Foreign Service inspection system, and our people abroad
are aware of its valuable function. In addition to insur-
ing that the Department‘s regulations are being adhered
to. it has been providing an opportunity for the employees
attached to missions and consulates to transmit directly
to me, to the Under Secretary, and to the other top oﬂicials
of the Department their ideas which have been and are
most necessary and valuable to the continued improve-
ment of the service. FI will continue to be administered
separately. as in the past, and as are the several oﬂces
concerned with consular functions and security. They will
be subject to the general supervision of the Administrator,
SCA.
I am aware that no agency of the Government can im-
prove, or even maintain. its level of effectiveness unless
it is receiving a stream of new ideas and constructive criti-
cisms. I hope that the inspection operation will be the
focal reception point of that stream. I have told Mr.
McLeod that in his capacity as administrator of the in-
spection operation he should be available at any time to
receive personally from any of our people the beneﬁt of
their thinking on improving operations and procedures or
on other problems, oﬂicial and personal.
In brief, I regard the internal inspection operation of
the Department as one of its m0st important concerns.
Its success will depend upon the cooperation and aid re-
ceived generally from employees of the Department.
It is my wish that the reorganization of the inspection
arm will work to the continued beneﬁt of all employees of
the Department of State and toward more effective and
economical performance of our responsibilities.
