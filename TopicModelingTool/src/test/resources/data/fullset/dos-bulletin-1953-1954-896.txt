oﬁ'ered today, has been completely ineffective, de-
spite the fact that it had clear and detailed terms
of reference. Its effectiveness de ended on Com-
munist good faith that has been acking. Under
such circumstances, we are forced to the conclusion
that this sort of a supervisory commission means.
at best, no supervision at all.
Mr. Chairman, words like “free elections” and
“uniﬁcation” mean nothing whatever if there is
no meeting of minds. The people of Korea and
the peoples of the world will not be satisﬁed with
empty words. They want to know whether the
Communists are in fact willing to agree to the
necessary steps, procedures, and instrumentalities
which would assure the concepts like “free elec-
tions” have true meaning and assure that they can
be realized for the Korean people. This can be
realized only if the Communists are willing to
abandon their insistence on a form of organization
which provides an automatic veto. Our ob'ective,
as Mr. Chou En-lai has said, are genuinely free
elections held under conditions of genuine free-
dom. But, I don’t think he means the same things
as I mean when he says those words!
Genuinely free elections in Korea can indeed be
assured if the elections are placed under the con-
trol and supervision of the United Nations. The
United Nations has the competence, the experi-
ence, the authority, the impartiality, and the fa-
cilities to perform this task. They could never
take place under the formula proposed by Mr.
Nam 11. The vast majority of us represented here
know what really free, uncoerced elections are,
and we are not to be deluded.
I am glad that Mr. Nam 11 and Mr. Chou En-lai,
and ﬁnally Mr. Molotov, have made the issue so
crystal clear. I believe it will be equally clear to
world public opinion, and in so far as my delega-
tion is concerned, we are quite prepared to rest
the case of the United Nations before the bar of
world opinion, on the statements which our Com-
munist colleagues have made today and on those
which I and my colleagues have made at this and
our previous plenary sessions.
STATEMENT 0N INDOCHINA, JUNE 9
Press release 315 dated June 10
As I listened yesterday to Mr. Molotov’s state-
ment and to that of Mr. Chou En-lai today, I
felt a disappointment—shared, I am sure, by
other delegations—at their unconstructive char-
acter. I had hoped for some deﬁnite response to
our eﬂ’orts toward compromise on basic issues.
Since this has not been forthcoming and since
we have had only a reiteration of deceptive for-
mulas which have been given us on a number of
previous occasions, I feel that it is necessary now
for me to comment on the charges reiterated on
several occasions by Mr. Molotov and more intem-
942


erately repeated by Mr. Dong and Mr. Chou En-
ai of aggressive designs and im erialistic inten-
tions and deliberate deceptions an obstructions on
the part of the United States and of our friends
and allies.
These charges are part of a familiar pattern.
I’m quite sure that Mr. Molotov, and probably
Mr. Chou En-lai, do not themselves actually be-
lieve that they will be taken seriously, except
possibly in those countries where the instrumental-
ities of government are devoted to the suppression
of the distribution of accurate and unbiased
information.
I would assume, therefore, that Mr. Molotov
was not actually speakin to us, but rather the
regimented audience in urope and Asia which
accepts the Cominform line. I believe therefore
that it is sufﬁcient for me, in reply, to say that the
record of my country during and since the Second
World War is well known to the whole free world.
We are quite willing to have our present and our
future intentions jud ed from this record, and I
am sure that the con dence of our associates will
not be diminished and that of less fortunate
people, if they were permitted to examine the
record, would be restored.
We sometimes overlook the fact that we know
a great deal also about the record of the Soviet
Union during this same period, and, in judging
the resent and future intentions of the Com-
munist states and in assessing the validity of their
proposals, I suggest we can learn more from re-
viewing this record than from such statements as
those which our Communist colleagues have per-
mitted themselves to make. For example, when
Mr. Molotov and Mr. Chou En-lai speak of the
national liberation movements of the peoples of
Asia, I am at once moved to recall what Mr.
Molotov and the Government he has so long rep-
resented have actually done to affect the national
aspirations of various smaller nations.
I would therefore remind you all of the mutual
assistance treaties which the Soviet Union made
in 1939 with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. On
October 31, 1939, Mr. Molotov, as reported in the
Soviet press, said of these treaties that they “in
no way imply any interference on the part of the
Soviet Union in the affairs of Estonia, Latvia or
Lithuania. . . . On the contrary, all of these
pacts of mutual assistance strictly stipulate the
inviolability of the sovereignty of the signatory
states and the principle of noninterference in each
other’s affairs. . . . We stand for the scrupulous
and punctilious observance of the pacts on the
basis of complete reciprocity, and we declare that
all the nonsensical talk about the sovietization of
the Baltic countries is only to the interest of our
common enemies and of all anti-Soviet provoca-
teurs.”
The fate which overtook Estonia, Latvia, and
Lithuania very soon after this verbally admirable
