munications. With the emergence of radio the
Union attracted worldwide participation.
Prlnce Henry’s Flight
The ﬁrst International Radio Conference was
held at Berlin in 1903 as a result of difﬁculties
experienced by Prince Henry of Prussia during
his voyage home after a visit to the United States.
His attempts to send a courtesy message to Presi-
dent Theodore Roosevelt were thwarted by the
refusal of the British Marconi Company to trans-
mit traﬂic from a ship station of its German com-
petitor. When advised of this incident, the Ger-
man Emperor enlisted the support of President
Roosevelt in efforts to reach an international
agreement prohibiting the refusal by shore sta-
tions of messages from ships at sea.
The resulting protocol embodied this principle
and others which remain the basic law of inter-
national radio re lations to this day—notably,
the recognition 0 priority for distress calls, the
regulation of radio services to avoid interference
between stations, and the exemption of military
services from the radio regulations except for the
provisions relating to distress calls and interfer-
ence. Signiﬁcant rogress was made in 1927 when
the ﬁrst international table of radio-frequency
allocations was adopted. In spite of limitations
imposed by established ship services in the high-
frequency range and by the existence of many
mixed service stations, a guide was thus formu-
lated for policing the radio spectrum. The ad-
ministrative consolidation of principles and regu-
lations governing the operations of radio. te e-
phone, and telegraph eventually was accomplished
y the Madrid Telecommunications Convention of
1932, at which time the Telegraph Union was sup-
lanted by the International Telecommunication
nion.
As new techniques were develo d, higher fre-
quency bands were opened up. IIiiiproved navi-
gational aids, aeronautical communications, land
mobile stations, television, and FM broadcast-
ing services made their appearance or reached
promising stages of development. The exigencies
of World War II were met by great technical ad-
vances and a consequent further increase in the
demand for high fr encies. The resulting
overcrowding of the high-frequency broadcasting
bands created serious interference problems.
To cope with the expanding servrces and the dis-
order occasioned by the war a further Interna-
tional Telecommunication Conference was con-
vened in 1947 at Atlantic City, N. J .2 Probably
the most important single accomplishment of the
conference was the general acceptance of a new
frequency allocation table. By now, however, the
structure of the Union itself was seriously inade-

uate and a drastic reorganization was brought
a ut by the new International Telecommunica-
tion Convention. This convention established the
Plenipotentiary Conference as the supreme organ
of the International Telecommunication Union.
The Plenipotentiary Conference normally meets
once every 5 years; the ﬁrst meeting was held in
1952 at Buenos Aires, where a slightly revised con-
vention was si ed.8
The Atlantic City Convention made further
provision for an Administrative Council which
meets at least once a year to insure the continuity
of functions between pleni otentiary conferences.
Through the instrument 0 the Council the Union
is able to deal prom tly with problems of policy.
The Bureau of the Union was reor anized into a
General Secretariat with increase responsibili-
ties, and the three permanent technical commit-
tees, which conduct studies and issue recommenda-
tions on technical, operating, and tariﬂ‘ questions,
were brought into a closer relationship with the
Union. These three committees are the Interna-
tional Telegraph Consultative Committee, the
International Telephone Consultative Committee,
and the International Radio Consultative Com-
mittee. Corresponding to their work and subordi-
nate to the Convention are three sets of interna-
tional technical regulations which provide a uni-
form code of operations for the international tele-
graph, telephone, and radio industries. The regu-
lations are periodically revised at administrative
conferences held every 5 ears.
A major innovation 0 the International Tele-
communication Convention of 1947 was the crea-
tion of an International Frequency Registration
Board (Iran) of 11 members to give further
impetus to the economic use of radio frequencies.
The fundamental concept of such a board was em-
bodied in United States proposals at Atlantic City.
Although the Board as ﬁnally constituted differs
in some aspects from that enVisaged by the United
States, it as shown promise of becoming an ex-
ceedingly useful instrument in the resolution of
international frequency problems.
0.8. Leadership In Telecommunication
It is not surprising that the United States is
the greatest user of world telecommunications
facilities. The vastly increased scope of U.S.
articipation in world affairs, the assumption of
arger international responsibilities, the inﬂuence
exerted by U.S. private and public agencies
abroad, and the resulting ampliﬁed role of com-
munications have left this Government no choice
