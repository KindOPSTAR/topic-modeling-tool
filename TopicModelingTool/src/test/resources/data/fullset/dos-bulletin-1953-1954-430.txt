4. The undersigned has been appointed by the
Government of the United States of America as
its agent for the purpose of this application and
all proceedings thereon.
Very truly yours,
HERMAN PHLEGER
The Legal Admiser
of the
Department of State
Review of the U.N. Charter
Statement by Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.
U. 8. Representative to the United Nations1
The purpose of this statement is not to give
ﬁnal conclusions. The Executive Branch wants
to await the advice of Congress, as well as the
views of the American citizenry. We are also in-
terested in the views of other nations. Of course,
it is fundamental that no charter amendments can
come into effect without the consent of the Senate.
Secretary Dulles has identiﬁed for you some of
the principal questions that he felt your commit-
tee and the American people should be looking
into so that our ﬁnal policies can be the product
of thoughtful and realistic study.z
Today your attention is invited to a few of the
issues that seem particular! important in the
light of my service as the U. . Representative to
the United Nations.
Before doing this, let the Administration’s
steadfast support of active U.S. participation in
the United Nations be repeated. My own convic-
tion, based on ﬁrst-hand experience, is that our
participation is clearly required by our national in-
terests, both short-term and long-range, and that
the review conference should not be allowed to
jeopardize the good we have already worked so
hard to build up. President Eisenhower recently
said of the United Nations that “it still represents
man’s best organized hope to substitute the confer-
ence table for the battleﬁeld,” and he character-
ized it as “sheer necessity.” ‘
Misuse of Veto
I. Let me begin by commending to your study
the recommendations the Senate made to the Ex-
ecutive in the Vandenberg resolution of 1948,‘ and
which represent the policy of this Administration.
This is the proposal that the Charter be amended
to eliminate the veto: (a) on the admission of
new members and (b) on the paciﬁc settlement of
dis utes.
f course when we think about it we see that
our interests and our security require that we re-
tain the ﬁnal say on anything involving the use of
American forces. This means the right to use
the veto.
a. But on the matter of membership, 14 de-
serving nations have been blocked from admission
to the United Nations because of Soviet Russia’s
abuse of the veto power in the Securit Council.
These are Austria, Cambodia Ceylon, ire Fin-
land, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Republic of Korea,
Laos, Libya, Nepal, Portu al, and Viet-Nam.
You would be well adVised therefore to take a
new look at article 4 on membership qualiﬁcations,
in conjunction with article 27 on the veto, in seeing
what this country might propose to change this
unfortunate situation.
b. Neither should one nation (possess the right
to veto paciﬁc settlements of isputes. Some-
times these settlements have been laboriously
arrived at by nations workin in good faith and
then thrown out of the win 0w by one trouble-
maker. A few weeks ago, in the last case handled
by the Security Council for instance—the dispute
between Syria and Israel—a veto on a proposed
course of settlement favored by a majority of
members was the Soviet Union’s only contribution.‘
Organizational Structure of U.N. System
II. The second question which is deserving of
thou ht is the overall organizational structure of
the nited Nations system, by which I mean the
United Nations pro r plus the various specialized
agencies such as no, Ino, Icao, Fae, Umoo,
and so forth. These specialized agencies are en-
tirely outside of my jurisdiction and I have no
responsibility for their operation. And of course
the review conference we are talking about in-
volves only the United Nations Charter. But
under articles 17, 57, 58, 59, 62, 63, 64, 66, 70, 91,
and 96, there is a deﬁnite although limited rela-
tionship. The United Nations arranges for cre-
ation of specialized agencies; it gets re its from
them; it does work for them; they sit Without vote
in United Nations meetings; and, most important
the specialized agencies come into a contractual
relationship with the United Nations itself. The
United Nations is supposed to make recommenda-
tions for coordination of their policies and
activities.
Now a certain amount of formal coordination
does exist. For example, there are some formal
agreements which aim at creating contacts between
the United Nations and the 10 existing agencies.
The United Nations does consider their reports

Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Mar. 3 (press
release 104).
