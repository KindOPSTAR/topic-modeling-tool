Impoi'tance of the Individual to Technical Coopera-
tlon
These heartwarming stories are a vivid expres-
sion of both the political and religious heritage of
America. Our people are deeply concerned with
the individual. Our youth strive to emulate great
men. The spotlight has always been focused upon
individual accomplishments and individual as-
pirations.
Our Bill of Rights guards the minority from
the abuses of the majority and protects the op-
portunit for the individual citizen to achieve his
otentia economically, politically, and spiritually.
rom another viewpoint that same spirit is part
of our religious heritage. \Ve gage the achieve-
ments of these programs with a clear recognition
of the inherent value of the individual man.
Out of past experiences there have been devel-
oped in recent months new trends in our technical
cooperation programs. In planning these activi-
ties, we have made far greater use of colleges, uni-
versities, rofessional societies, and cultural
groups. T iese resources enable us to tap broader
sources of knowledge and experience to implement
the rograms.
T ere are now 35 college contracts under the
technical coo eration programs, and the Foreign
Operations dministration has agreements with
113 professional societies and commercial organi-
zations to provide speciﬁc technical services
abroad.
There has been an encouraging increase in proj-
ects carried out in cooperation with voluntary
agencies, both of a religious and secular charac-
ter. These church and lay groups play a highly
signiﬁcant role in technical cooperation. Because
of the very nature of their organization, volun-
tary agencies are free to experiment and in a very
large way to pioneer in technical cooperation work.
They can undertake pilot projects which yield
many valuable experiences which are later applied
to full-scale technical cooperation activities.
Moreover, it is often easier for these voluntary
groups to get down to the level of the individual,
where the most effective gains can be made.
Results vs. Costs
The total United States budget for technical
cooperation, including the U.S. contributions to
the multilateral activities of the United Nations,
amounts to about 10 cents a month for each U.S.
adult citizen.
I am ﬁrmly convinced that this is a small sum
when compared to the achievements of these
activities.

They are of necessity long-range programs.
They are a roduct of a continuing and livin
experience. hey are based upon the individua
dignity of man and a deep-rooted belief that,
given the opportunity, all men can supplant futil-
ity, fear, and poverty with faith, freedom, and
progress.
A year ago President Eisenhower urged:
. . . the dedication of the energies, the resources, and
the imaginations of all peaceful nations to a new kind
of war. This would be a declared total war, not upon
any human enemy but upon the brute forces of poverty
and need.
The peace we seek, founded upon decent trust and
cooperative eﬂort among nations, can be fortiﬁed, not
by weapons of war but by wheat and by cotton, by milk
and by wool, by meat and by timber and by rice. These
are words that translate into every language on earth.
These are needs that challenge this world in arms.
He then went on to say:
. . . The purposes or this great work would be to help
other peoples to develop the undeveloped areas of the
world, to stimulate proﬁtable and fair world trade, to
assist all peoples to know the blessings of productive
freedom.
The monuments to this new kind of war would be these:
roads and schools, hospitals and homes, food and
health.
We are ready, in short, to dedicate our strength to
serving the needs, rather than the fears, of the world.
It is through these technical cooperation pro-
grams that the United States seeks to translate
Into practice those principles which are the moving
force behind the inspiring words of our President.
