I think as you that their sacriﬁces have not
been in vain.
For our struggle, which will be able to surmount
this reverse, we can draw a great comfort in the
determination of the American people and in your
personal will of aiding the free forces who resist
Communist imperialism.
Please accept, Mr. President, the expression of
my personal feeling of sincere affection.
Governors To Observe
Korean Reconstruction
The departure on May 21 of Governors Dan
Thornton of Colorado, Johnston Murray of Okla-
homa, John S. Fine of Pennsylvania, and Allen
Shivers of Texas on a 16-day trip to observe Amer-
ican and United Nations relief and rehabilitation
programs in Korea was announced by the Foreign
Operations Administration on May 19. The coor-
dinated programs are being carried out with a
U.S. contribution of $320 million during the cur-
rent ﬁscal year.
The trip is being made in response to an invi-
tation from President Eisenhower extended last
February to members of the executive committee
of the Governors’ Conference. The President said
that the personal evaluation by a delegation of
State governors of the progress being made in im-
proving Korea’s military position and helping to
rebuild its war-torn economy would provide the
public with the essential knowledge and broad un-
derstanding to which it is entitled.
In Korea the governors will observe the opera-
tion of all phases of the coordinated relief and re-
habilitation programs of the U.S. and U.N. which
are carried out under the direction of C. Tyler
Wood, U.N. Economic Coordinator. They include
the U.S. program of civil relief in Korea, adminis-
tered by a U.S. Army organization known as the
Korea Civil Assistance Command, with $80.1
million programed this year; a $10 million emer-
gency contribution of U.S. Army food rations at
the end of the ﬁghting last summer; the U.N.
Korean Reconstruction Agency program, to which
the U.S. Will contribute up to $30 million; and the
$200 million FOA program for reconstruction of
basic facilities, agriculture and industry, and im-
port of essential supplies.
Export-Import Bank
Loan to Afghanistan
The Export-Import Bank of Washington an-
nounced on May 4 authorization of a loan of $18.5
million to the Royal Government of Afghanistan
to assist in ﬁnancing purchase of U.S. materials,
equipment, and services for the Helmand River
Valley development project and for the organiza-
tion and training of an Afghan road maintenance
unit.
This is the second credit which the bank has
made to assist the Government of Afghanistan in
carrying out the Helmand project, which beneﬁts
directly about one-fourth of the land area of
Afghanistan and at least one-sixth of its 12 mil-
lion people. The earlier credit was authorized on
November 23, 1949, in the amount of $21 million to
assist in ﬁnancing the purchase of U.S. materials,
equipment, and services for the construction of the
Kajakai Dam, the Arghandab Dam, and the
Boghra Canal system. The work was carried out,
by Morrison Knudsen Afghanistan, Inc., with the
result that primary storage regulation of the val-
ley’s two major rivers has been established.
The second stage of the development, which will
involve total costs estimated at approximately $27
million in all currencies, provides for a 3-year
construction and agricultural development pro-
gram, including hydroelectric power installations,
main canals, laterals, and primary drainage. The
construction plans are closely correlated with an
agricultural development program to be carried
out under the direction of the Afghan Helmand
Valley Authority, which is receiving technical
assistance from the Foreign Operations Ad-
ministration.
These developments, for which Export-Import
Bank assistance is being given, will progressively
result in an increase in the productive capacity of
Afghan agriculture of over 700,000 acres of im-
proved and new land. At the same time, the proj-
ect will make a major contribution to solution of
the problem of the settlement of Afghanistan’s
tribal nomads.
Terms of the new ﬁnancing will provide for re—
payment in 36 semiannual installments com-
mencing October 20, 1958, at an interest rate of
41/2 percent per annum.
In announcing authorization of this credit, Gen.
Glen E. Edgerton, Managing Director of the bank,
stated : “This great project constitutes a basic fea-
ture of the economic development program of
Afghanistan and, when completed, will stand as an
enduring monument to the enterprise of the
Afghan people and to the friendship and coopera-
tion of Afghanistan and the United States.”
On May 14 the bank announced the signing on
that date of the loan agreement by General Edger-
ton and Mohammad Kabir Ludin, Ambassador of
Afghanistan to the United States. During the
ceremonies, General Edgerton announced that the
bank was sending a mission to Afghanistan im-
mediately to consult with the Government in order
to initiate construction under the new loan pro-
gram as rapidly as possible.
