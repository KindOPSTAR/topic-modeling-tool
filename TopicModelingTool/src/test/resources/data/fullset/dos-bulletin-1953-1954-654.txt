The Search for Means of
Controlling Atomic Energy
Statements by Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.

Nature of Commission's Task
U.S./U.N. press release 1901 dated April 9
The Disarmament Commission resumes its work
at a moment when the whole world is gripped with
the knowledge that a new dimension has been
added to the dangers of the atomic age. -
Months before the recent tests at the Paciﬁc
roving grounds, the President of the United
States spoke to us on December 8 here in the
United Nations about the signiﬁcance to the world
of what he called these “fearful engines of atomic
might.” ’ He offered concrete proposals which ex-
pressed the conscience and the hope of America,
and I believe of all of humanity. He called upon
us to ﬁnd a way out of the “dark chamber of
horrors” into which the perversion of atomic de-
velopment for warlike purpose seems to be lead-
ing us.
We are interested that the Soviet Union recog-
nizes and declares the peril which threatens it as
well as all of us in the free world. In its recent
note delivered to the United States Government ‘
it states:
There cannot be any doubt that the use of atomic and
hydrouen weapons in war would cause untold disaster to
peoples, would mean mass annihilation of the world's
population, destruction of large cities—the centers of pres-
ent day industry. culture, and science, including the oldest
centers of civilization which are the largest capitals of
world states.
This is certainly true.
And now the Prime Minister of India has made
a statement to his Parliament on atomic and hydro-
gen weapons which in accordance with his request
has been distributed as a Disarmament Commis-
sion document.‘ It is clearly entitled to respect-
ful attention. We suggest that this document be
referred to the subcommittee and be considered
there.
\Ve may assume, therefore, that on both sides of
the line which now divides the world there is a
recognition of mortal danger. lVe, on our side,
hope that this increasing awareness on the Com-
munist side will be accompanied by a determina-
tion matching our own to circumvent the danger
and to unlock for mankind the incalculable good
in atomic energy.

good faith, upon a ﬁexi
Until we ﬁnd a solution to this most pressing
problem of our age, neither our world nor the
Communist world can be free of the heavy burdens
of the arms race nor of the shadow of atomic war.
An understanding de )ends u on good will and
bility of) mind and a will-
1ngness to explore new methods, and above all
an interest and a desire to get action and results.
Sometimes these qualities have been lacking but
in spite of many past disappointments we never
give up hope.

Text of Resolution Adopted by Disarmament ‘
Commission on April 191
U.N. doc. DC/49
Dated April 19
The Disarmament Commission.
Noting General Assembly resolution 715 (VIII)
and the resolution on disarmament agreed by the
Four Foreign Ministers at. Berlin on 18 February
1954,
1. Decides, pursuant to General Assembly resolution
715 (VIII), to establish a Sub-Committee consisting
of representatives of Canada, France, the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics. the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United
States of America;
2. Recommends that the Sub-Committee should hold
its ﬁrst meeting on 23 April, and should arrange its
own meetings and method of work;
3. Recommends that the Sub-Committee should pre-
sent a report on the results of its work to the Dis-
armament Commission not later than 15 July.
‘ Introduced by the United Kingdom; adopted, as
amended, by a vote of 9—1 (U.S.S.R.)—2 (Lebanon,
China). The Soviet proposal was rejected by a
vote of 1 (U.S.S.R.)—10—1 (Lebanon).



We in this country particularly approach this
new round of talks with a deep sense of obliga-
tion. As pioneers and principal custodians of
atomic energy, we have never ceased to encourage
initiative to bring it under control. The plan
oifered to the U.N. as far back as 1946 constituted
one such initiative; President Eisenhower’s pro-
posals of last December for an international pool
of ﬁssionable material for peaceful purposes is
another. The Secretary of State of the United
States is currently discussing the project with
re resentatives of the Soviet Union.
e also welcome most earnestly any proposals
for revisin the method of dealing with disarma-
ment whic promises to make discussions more
fruitful. For all these reasons, the United States
Government stands ready to pursue the pro
sive suggestions made by the past session 0 the
General Assembly for the establishment of a sub-
committee of this commission to “seek in private
an acceptable solution.“ We are hopeful that
such close and intimate consultation, untrain-
meled by publicity and unburdened of the weight
