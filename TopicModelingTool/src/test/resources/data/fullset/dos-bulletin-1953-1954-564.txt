been in operation for some time in several places
and I hope that it will meet with the support of
both your communities and our forces.
I feel very deeply that if we work together to
perfect our mutual understanding, those ties be-
tween our countries which have been of incalcu-
lable importance to the peace and well-being of the
world Will be even further strengthened. I hardly
need add that I can think of nothing more worth-
while than the strengthening of those ties.

First of all let me sa that, whenever troubled
relations between ourse ves and the Indians exist,
this is not a cause of concern to the Communists.
There is little they would like better than to see
friction between the two countries develop. They
would like to see India and America alienated
complete] from each other. They are t ing to
accomplis just that right now. The mlin
today is using all the propaganda devices in its
possession to make the Indians feel that we are
their enemies; that we represent a new imperial-
ism; that we intend to dominate their econom ;
that we are bent on involving the whole wor (1,
including India, in a new world war; that what
we hope to do and see in the area of the Middle
East and South Asia is carefully calculated to go
against Indian national interests.
These themes, let us admit, have not been se-
lected at random. They have been chosen with
the utmost care by the Soviets because the believe
that these are the lines which are most ikely to
be believed in India.
What the Communists do and say, however, is
not sufﬁcient to have an very serious effect on
U. S.-Indian relations eir strength in India
is not that great. But we must frankly admit
that today American relations with India are not
as completely cordial as we would like to see them.
There are various reasons for this. Partly it is a
case of mutual misunderstanding arising out of
the differing backgrounds of the two nations.
Partly, however, our differences arise out of ordi-
nary disagreements over the best ways to handle

speciﬁc problems. For example, we have dis-
agreed over the attitude which should be adopted
toward Communist China. It took us a lon time
to reconcile our positions in regard to the orean
truce negotiations. We have not seen eye to eye
over action to be taken in the United Nations re-
garding French North Africa and other questions
involving dependent areas. I could name other
instances of disa cement. The list might seem
formidable and discouraging, but I hasten to em-
phasize that a similar list could be drawn up for
almost any other major country in the world.
Even with our best friends, and sometimes espe-
cially with our best friends, we are bound to have
ar ments.
any of our disagreements with India are now
ast history, and, I hope, in the process of being
orgotten. There is, however, one current prob-
lem which deserves special attention. It is the
most recent to arise and the main source of con-
cern in our mutual relations at the present moment.
That is the American decision to extend military
aid to Pakistan.
We made that decision for reasons well known
to Americans, but sometimes misunderstood
abroad.
This country and many others believe that our
way of life is critically threatened by a predatory
power which reco izes that the greatest threat
to its existence is t e very presence of democracy.
Soviet communism seeks to destroy us all. It
bears repeating that the actions of the Soviet
Union prove beyond a doubt that it will use every
means at its disposal, including war, to enslave
us. Unless ad uate measures are taken b the
