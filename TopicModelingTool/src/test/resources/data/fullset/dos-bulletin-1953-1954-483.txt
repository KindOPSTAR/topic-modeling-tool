Allied Efforts To Restore Freedom of Movement in Germany
Representatives of the United States, the United
Kingdom, and France in recent weeks addressed
identical letters to Soviet authorities in Germany
proposing the removal of restrictions on freedom
of movement within Germany.1 Following are
terts of the correspondence between Ambassador
James B. Conant, U.S. High Commissioner for
Germany, and Vladimir Semeno'v, So'viet High
Commissioner for Germany, together with letters
exchanged by Maj. Gen. Thomas S. Timberman,
U .S. Commandant in Berlin, and Sergei Dengin,
Berlin representative of the Soviet High Com-
missioner for Germany.
Ambassador Conant to Mr. Semenov, February 22
At the meeting in Berlin on February 18 of the
Foreign Ministers of the U.K., U.S.A., France
and the U.S.S.R., it was stated that the govern-
ments of the U.K., the U.S.A. and France had
initiated a study of the ste s that could be taken to
lessen the hardships whic result for the German
peo 1e from the present division of Germany.2
Alt ough such steps are no substitute for the re-
uniﬁcation of Germany and the conclusion of a
peace treaty, which remain the objectives of its
polic , the U.S. Government considers that it
shou d be possible for the four occupying powers
in Germany to reach immediate agreement on the
elimination of a certain number of unjustiﬁable ob-
stacles which still prevent freedom of movement
between the different parts of German . The U.S.
Government believes that the Four owers could
in this way bring about an immediate and essential
improvement in the living conditions of all Ger-
many.
I therefore propose to you that we shall agree
that each of us should, as appropriate, take the
following measures:
A. The abolition of the requirement for resi-
dence permits for Germans residing in the Federal
Territory who desire to travel to the Soviet Zone.
The maintenance of this formality in fact consid-

erably reduces the eﬂ’ect of the abolition of inter-
zonal asses which was decided at the end of 1953.
B. be opening of the inter-zonal crossing
points which have been closed by the Soviet au-
thorities on various dates before the middle of
1952. I would remind you of the proposal on this
sub'ect made to you in my letter of January 8.8
G. The improvement of inter-zonal road and
rail transport services including the introduction
of fast rail services with im roved passenger fa-
cilities between the principa cities of West Ger-
many on the one hand and East Germany and
Berlin on the other.
D. The removal of the prohibited zone, the
barbed wire fences and all other barriers placed
in the Soviet Zone alon the Soviet Zone border.
E. The abolition of a 1 controls and of all im-
pediments to the free circulation of printed
matter.
As regards Berlin, we should agree upon suit-
able methods for re-establishing more normal
living conditions for the inhabitants of the city.
In particular, I consider it necessary to reach de-
cisions on the two following questions:
A. The abolition of all formalities re movement
of ersons between Berlin and the Soviet Zone.
. The removal of all impediments to the free
movement of persons and of goods between the
Western sectors of Berlin and lVestern Germany;
in particular the abolition of the uirement for
the endorsement of Warenbegleitsc ine [certiﬁ-
cates for goods in transit] for such goods by the
authorities of the Soviet Zone and the introduc-
tion of arrangements for the customs-free transit
of such goods.
I shall be glad to meet with you at your early
convenience to discuss these proposals.
If, as I hope, they are acceptable to you, tech-
nical discussions may be required concerning pro-
posals B and C in paragraph 2 above. In that
event I shall be prepared to furnish the names of
the German technical experts authorized to deal
with these matters in respect of Western Germany
and I would be glad to obtain corresponding in-
formation from you.
