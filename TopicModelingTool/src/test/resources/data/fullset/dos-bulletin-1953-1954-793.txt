Mllltary Defense of Continent
First, in regard to military defense of the con-
tinent, it is obvious that, under present world con-
ditions, Latin America occupies a different osi-
tion in our defense system from that which it eld
at the beginning of World War II. In 1940 we
were concerned over the possibility of attacks upon
the U.S. via the southern continent. Hemisphere
defense and national defense were concepts so
closely related as to be virtually indistinguishable.
Today the situation has been greatly changed
by the nature of modern warfare. If the U.S.
is to be attacked, the most probable course will be
via the northern part of the hemisphere rather
than the southern. Moreover, the nature of the
threat which the U.S. faces in the world today has
made it necessary for us to extend our strategic
defense lines far beyond the shores of this con-
tinent into Euro e on the one hand and Asia on
the other. Thus atin America can hardly be con-
sidered as one of the most likely combat areas.
Nevertheless the necessity for arrangements to
insure the militar security of the Western Hemi-
5 here remains. his fact was recognized at the
ourth Meeting of American Forei n Ministers,
held in Washington in 1951 shortly a ter the active
entrance of Communist China into the Korean
lVar. Considering the military problems of the
hemisphere, the Fourth Meeting of Foreign Min-
isters recommended that the American nations
reorient their military olicies so as to contribute
to their best ability to t 1e collective defense of the
continent. The Inter-American Defense Board,
an organization on which all the American Re-
publics are represented, was directed to carry for-
ward its military plans for continental defense.
On the basis of these plans the U.S. has entered
into bilateral military agreements with nine of the
other American Republics. These agreements pro-
vided for certain military assistance from the
U.S. in developing armed forces that will be use-
ful in carryin out the plans for hemisphere de-
fense in accor ance with the recommendations of
the Inter-American Defense Board.
The work of the Inter-American Defense Board,
and the policies pursued by the U.S. in military
cooperation with the other American Republics,
have thus established at least the beginnings of an
effective military defense program based upon the
Eclitical and legal commitments of the Treaty of
i0 de J aneiro.
Melntenanee of Peace Among American States
Turning now to the problem of maintainin
peace among the American Republics, we ﬁn
some special and noteworthy developments. The
Treaty of Rio de Janeiro deals essentially with
enforcement measures to prevent or repel armed
conﬂict. Its authority is backed up in the last
analysis by the possibility of using armed force.
The Latin American countries have, however,
May 31, I954
traditionally disliked the prospect of using armed
force against any one of their number. The whole
emphasis in the development of inter-American
peaceful relations has been upon the proscription
of the use of force and insistence upon the settle-
ment of international disputes by legal and orderly
methods.
A great deal of effort has been expended during
the past century among the American Re ublics
in attempting to devise a practical system 0 agree-
ments for the settlement of inter-American dis-
putes by such recognized methods as mediation,
conciliation, arbitration, and adjudication. Over
a period of years numerous treaties involvin these
procedures have been drawn u , and ela orate
systems for the appointment 0 commissions of
investigation, or panels of arbitrators, have been
devised. The most recent of these efforts was an
attempt made in Bogota in 1948 to consolidate
all methods of eaceful solution in one instrument
known as the nter-American Treaty of Paciﬁc
Settlement, or the Pact of Bogota.
Like most of its predecessors, the Pact of Bogota
suffered from an excess of perfectionism. Tech-
nically and legally, it has much to commend it.
But from the standpoint of political realism, its
drawbacks are indicated b the fact that now, 6
years after its si ature, on y 8 of the 21 American
States have rati ed it. The possibility of revising
it was brieﬂ considered at the recent Caracas con-
ference, an it is now under oing further study
in the Council of the Organization of American
States in Washington.
Nevertheless the importance of the peaceful
solution of international disputes among the
American States should not be in any sense de-
preciated. The excellent record which the Inter-
American Peace Committee has made in helping
States resolve their controversies peacefully merits
attention and ap roval. Moreover, the very fact
that the Treaty 0 Rio de J aneiro makes it possible
to bring force to bear upon an aggressor nation
in the Americas ma be considered to have
strengthened the likelihood of reaching peaceful
settlements.
This fact was illustrated in the two cases in
which the Treaty of Rio de Janeiro has been in-
voked to date. In 1948—49 a dispute between Costa
Rica and Nicaragua, involving the crossing of the
border by armed men, brought swift action under
the Rio Treaty. Acting provisionally as Organ
of Consultation under the Rio Treaty, the Council
of the Oas dispatched an investigating committee
to ascertain the facts, and called u on both States
to desist from any acts that woul aggravate the
situation. As a result of this prompt demonstra-
tion of effective interest, both governments com-
posed their diﬂiculties and signed a special agree-
ment pledging themselves to settle any future
controversy which might arise between them in
accordance with the above-mentioned Pact of
Bogota.
