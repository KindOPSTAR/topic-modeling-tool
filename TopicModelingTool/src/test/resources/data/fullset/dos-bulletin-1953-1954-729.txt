modiﬁcation and improvement to meet changing
conditions.
Months in advance of Rio we must sit down with
representatives of each of the American govern-
ments and compare our own policies and programs
with theirs in order to ﬁnd those areas of agree-
ment in which we can work together constructively.
Without waiting for the conference we must set
ourselves to the task of solving as many as possible
of those bilateral problems that do not r uire the
combined attention of all the ministers 0 ﬁnance

now and the time when we meet in Brazil.
Our Basic Economic Goal In Latin America
I have referred several times to our economic
policy in Latin America." 'Its basic oal is_ clear,
and we must never lose sight of it. er Simply,
it is to make our contribution to the esta lishment
in each of the Latin American countries of a
strong, self-reliant, anddurableinational economy.
There are two' points which I would like to
make regarding this policy. The ﬁrst is that while
the achievement of our oal will undoubtedly help
greatl in our united e art to eliminate commu-
nism rom this hemisphere, that is not our major
pur ose. As Secretary Dulles said in Caracas, our
goa would be the same if there were no Communist
problem. Happily, its accomplishment will con-
tribute to the solution of that problem, but in that
connection we must remember two thin .
First, the economic rograms of the ot er Amer-
ican Republics are 0? a long-term nature. The
effects of their dedicated efforts are increasingly
apparent, but full achievement will require a pe-
riod of years. On the other hand, the need to halt
the spread of communism here as in every other
American state is immediate.
Second, we all know that economic strength is
not the immediate answer to the Communist
threat. That threat is as great in highly indus-
trialized and pros erous countries as it is in under-
developed countrles. There is not an industrial-
ized state in the world which does not have a
Communist problem, and in some the seriousness
of that threat is much greater than in Latin
America. I believe the more immediate answer
to communism lies in a love of personal liberty and
the cherishing of individual initiative. The truth
is that man ﬁnds eater opportunit to live with
dignity and serenlty and enjoy steadlly increasing
fruits from his own eﬁorts and initiative under a
democratic form of government. Unless we hold
these beliefs, we are not prepared to resist com-
munism, regardless of our standard of living. The
real answer to communism must be sought in men’s
hearts and minds.
The second of the two points that I wanted to
make is this: As vital to our overall foreign policy
as will always be the building of strong and im-
perishable bonds of kinship and understanding be-
tween our peoples, even that is not the major ur-
pose of our policy in the economic ﬁeld. This
understanding is undoubtedly fostered by the ob-
vious fact that the people and Government of the
United States have a genuine interest in the pros-
perity of the peoples of Latin America. But our
policy is based primarily on the deep conviction
that the best interest of our own people will be
served by having strong and prosperous neighbors
to the south of us as there is to the north.
As President Eisenhower pointed out in his mes-
sage to Congress of March 30, an expanding for-
eign trade is absolutely essential to the strength of
our own economy as well as to that of our neigh-
bors. To the degree that the economies of the
other American Republics become stronger, just so
much more will they contribute to that expanding
foreign trade which is so essential to us a1 .
The greatest and most immediate justiﬁcation
for a policy of assisting our neighbors in their re-
solve to strengthen their economies is therefore the
beneﬁt which we as well as they will derive from
achieving that goal—beneﬁts in terms of better
living standards for all our peoples.
As im ortant as our goal of economic strength
for all t e Americas is our devotion to two basic
policies which will control all of our efforts to
achieve that goal. First, we must undertake noth-
ing which would have the effect of weakening our
own domestic economy, whose continued stren h
is such a vital factor in the rosperity of the ee
world. Second, our contri ution to strengthen-
ing the economies of the other American Republics
wi 1 be preponderantly through means designed to
encourage the establishment of those factors and
the practice of those economic principles which the
test of time has proved responsible for the strength
and durability of our own economy.
The other states comprising this eat American
family are sovereign nations. Eac has the right
to determine for itself the kind of economic sys-
tem which will exist within its boundaries. Each
will determine the measures it will adopt to make
that economy strong. Our contribution in the
ﬁeld will be made to rograms and policies which
our experience has ed us to believe will best
achieve this goal.
We must recognize that there are differences of
opinion as between ourselves and some of the
Latin American countries. Some of them are sin-
cerely convinced that our ideas in this ﬁeld are not
all sound. That is wholesome. It makes for a
constant and constructive reappraisal of ideas.
Yet in Caracas there was a degree of feeling
among the delegates that it was somehow undi -
niﬁed t0 disa Vree openly on these economic su
jects; that in ividuals and nations cannot frankly
disagree in some areas and still remain friends
who cooperate throughout all areas where they
can agree.
If we recognize that every nation must and will
act primarily in the interests of its own people,
