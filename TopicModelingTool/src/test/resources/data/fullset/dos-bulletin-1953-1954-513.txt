j.’ he area has great strategic value. Southeast
Asia is astride the most direct and best-developed
sea and air routes between the Paciﬁc and South
Asia. It has major naval and air bases. Com-
munist control of Southeast Asia would carry a
ave threat to the Philippines, Australia, and
ew Zealand, with whom we have treaties of
mutual assistance. The entire Western Paciﬁc
area, including,” the so-called “offshore island
chain,” would be strategically endangered.
President Eisenhower ap raised the situation
last lVednesday [March 24 when he said that
the area is of “transcendent importance.”
The United States Position
The United States has shown in many ways its
sympathy for the gallant struggle being waged
in Indochina by French forces and those of the
Associated States. Congress has enabled us to
provide material aid to the established govern-
ments and their peoples. Also, our diplomacy has
sought to deter Communist China from open ag-
gression in that area.
President Eisenhower, in his address of April
16, 1953,2 explained that a Korean armistice would
be a fraud if it merely released a gressive amiss
for attack elsewhere. I said last eptember 3 that
if Red China sent its own army into Indochina,
that would result in grave consequences which
mi ht not be conﬁned to Indochina.
ecent statements have been designed to impress
upon potential aggremors that aggression might
lead to action at laces and by means of free-
world choosing, so t at aggression would cost more
than it could gain.
The Chinese Communists have, in fact, avoided
the direct use of their own Red armies in open
aggression against Indochina. They have how-
ever, largely stepped u their support of the ag-
gression 1n that area. Indeed, they promote that
aggression by all means short of open invasion.
Under all the circumstances it seems desirable
to clarify further the United States sition.
Under the conditions of today, the 1mposition
on Southeast Asia of the political system of Com-
munist Russia and its Chinese Communist ally, by
whatever means, would be a grave threat to the
whole free community. The United States feels
that that possibility should not be passively ac-
cepted but should be met by united action. This
might involve serious risks. But these risks are
far less than those that will face us a few years
from now if we dare not be resolute today.
The free nations want peace. However, peace
is not had merely by wanting it. Peace has to be

worked for and planned for. Sometimes it is
necessary to take risks to win peace just as it is
necessary in war to take risks to win victory. The
chances for peace are usually bettered by letting
a potential aggressor know in advance where his
aggression cou d lead him.
I hope that these statements which I make here
tonight will serve the cause of peace.
Communist Chlna
Let me now discuss our political relations with
Red China, taking ﬁrst the matter of recomition.
The United States does not recognize the Chi-
nese Communist regime. That is well known.
But the reasons seem not so well known. Some
think that there are no reasons and that we are
actuated 11me by emotion. Your Government
believes tiiat its position is soberly rational.
Let me ﬁrst recall that diplomatic recognition
is a. voluntary act. One country has no rlght to
demand recognition b another. Generally, it is
useful that there shou d be diplomatic intercourse
between those who exercise de gusto vernmental
authority, and it is well esta lishe that recog-
nition does not imply moral approval.
President Monroe, in his famous message to
Congress, denounced the expansionist and despotic
system of Czarist Russia and its allies. But he
consider the government de facto as the le 'ti-
mate government for us.” That has indeed een
the general United States olicy, and I believe
that it is a sound general policy. However, where
it does not serve our interests, we are free to vary
from it.
In relation to Communist China, we are forced
to take account of the fact that the Chinese Com-
munist regime has been consistently and viciously
hostile to the United States.
A typical Chinese Communist pamphlet reads:
“We Must Hate America, because She is the
Chinese People’s Implacable Enemy.” “We Must
Despise America because it is a. Corrupt Imperi-
alist Nation, the World Center of Reaction and
Decadency.” “We Must Look down upon Amer-
ica because She is a Paper Tiger and Entirely
Vulnerable to Defeat.”
By print, by radio, by drama, by pictures, with
all the propaganda skills which communism has
devised, such themes are propagated by the Red
rulers. They vent their hatred by barbarous acts,
such as seizures and imprisonments of Americans.
Those responsible for United States policy must
ask and answer: "Will it help our country if, by
recognition, we give increased prestige and in-
ﬂuence to a regime that actively attacks our vital
'n crests?” I can ﬁnd only the answer: “No.”
‘L'Iset us turn now to the matter of seating Red
China in the United Nations. By the charter,
membership is supposed to be limited to “peace-
loving” states. Therefore, it is relevant to recall
jaid that it would nevertheless be our policy “to
