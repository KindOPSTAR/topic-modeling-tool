The Quest for Truth Through Freedom of Information
Statements by Preston. Hotchkis
U.S. Representative in the Economic and Social Council‘
IMPORTANCE OF A FREE PRESS
TO POLITICAL LIBERTY
U.S./UN. press release 1898 dated April 9
Three hundred and ten years a 0, ohm Milton
wrote the “Aeropagitica.” In de ending freedom
of information in his native land, Milton said:
And though all the winds of doctrine were let loose
to play upon the earth, so truth be in the ﬁeld, we do
injuriously by licensing and prohibiting to misdoubt her
strength. Let her and falsehood grapple; who ever knew
truth put to the worse, in a free and open encounter.
This guiding principle has worn well with time;
it remains a right lodestar for our discussmn
here.
For freedom of information is essential to po—
litical liberty—no other freedom is secure when
men and women cannot freely convey their
thoughts to one another. The very survival of
democratic government depends u on the man in
the street having access to all the information he
needs to exercise sound judgment on public issues.
The achievement of this goal has never been
easy. But the historic evolution of a free press
has taught us two important lessons.
First, that the growth of free information media
starts at the grassroots. People must value free
expression highly; they must have a real appetite
for it' and they must be willing to work hard for
it. N20 one can superimpose a free press on a
populace which doesn’t want it; no one can forever
deny it to a. populace which wants it badly enough.
Second, that the major obstacles to such a grass-
roots growth come from unenlightened govern-
ments. The development of a free press is a story
of hard-won triumphs over such repressive gov-
ernmental measures as licensing, censorship, sup-
pression of news and coercion of editors. Those
who hold power are often tempted to restrain free
criticism, if only because they believe that they
are wiser than their critics. Governmental in-
tervention is inevitably detrimental to freedom of
information.
So, the lesson of history is that paternalism is
incompatible with freedom of information. We
must choose between the free approach, in which
people strive for what they get, and a aternal-
istic one, in which everything is furnis ed by a
collective agency. The Soviet system is a classic
example of the latter, for the government pro-
vides all the material means for the expression
of ideas—printing shops, paper, etc—but only
at the cost of determining the ideas and control-
ling the expression.
Those who defend freedom of information, and
who caution their friends against treading the
path which leads toward totalitarianism, need
never feel bashful about speaking up. They are
enlisted with Milton in the right cause.
Practical Problems Involved
In that s irit, Mr. President, I shall examine
the practica problems before us. These problems
are outlined in three re orts—the outstandin
“Report on Freedom of nformation”’ prepare
by the rapporteur, Mr. Salvador P. Lopez; and
the two reports pre ared by the Secretary'General
in coo eration wit the s ecialized agencies on
the “ ‘ncouragement and evelopment of Inde-
pendent Domestic Information Enterprises”'
and “Production and Distribution of Newsprint
and Printing Paper.” ‘ These reports should con-
tribute greatly to our deliberations. Indeed, they
project so many suggestions that our real rob-
em is to establish priorities among available
tasks. _
The practical proposals made in these reports
fall into three main problem areas: (1) govern—
ment restrictions; (2) economic and technical
barriers to the ﬂow of information; and (3) pro-
fessional standards and the rights and responsi-
bilities of information media.

step that could be taken toward greater freedom
