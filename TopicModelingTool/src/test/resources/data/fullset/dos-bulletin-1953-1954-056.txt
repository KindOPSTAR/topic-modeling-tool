Excaumuc‘r:
I have the honor to refer to the request of the Govern-
ment of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan to the Gov-
ernment of the United States of America for assistance
in combatting starvation and suffering resulting from
famine conditions among the people of Jordan as a con-
sequence of the disastrous crop season just past. The
Government of the United States of America, recognizing
the burden undertaken by the Government of the Hasht.L
mite Kingdom of Jordan in seeking to relieve the suiferlng
of its people, azrees to assist the Government of the
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in this enterprise.
It is therefore proposed that :
1. The Government of the United States of America
will, subject to the terms and conditions of the United
States legislation applicable to web assistance and to the
terms and conditions set forth below, furnish to the Gov-
ernment of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan up to
10,000 tons of wheat in the form of a irrant in order to
alleviate starvation and mass suffering threatened by
famine conditions in Jordan. The Government of the
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan shall accept title to the
wheat upon delivery of wheat on board vessel and shall
be responsible for all costs accruing thereafter (other

Jordan),
2. In order to ensure maximum beneﬁts to the people
of Jordan from the assistance to be furnished hereunder,
the Government of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan

the Government of the United States of America, a plan
for the distribution of the wheat made available under
this Agreement among the people of Jordan and for the
distribution of such wheat and products thereof (1)
free of cost to persons who by virtue of circumstances
beyond their control are unable to pay for them and
(ii) to others at lowest feasible prices, as agreed upon,
from time to time, by the two Governments.
