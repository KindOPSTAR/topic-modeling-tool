Foreign Service Personnel
in U.S. Information Agency
White House press release dated March 27
The President has signed an Executive order
authorizing the Director of the United States In-
formation Agency to carry out all functions of
the Board of the Foreign Service relating to For-
eign Service personnel appointed or assigned for
service in that Agency.
This order constitutes one more step in the es-
tablishment of the U.S. Information Agency as
an independent operating unit of the Government.
As a practical matter, the order will have the
effect only of transferring to the U.S. Informa-
tion Agency authority to hear charges brought
against foreign service personnel within its juris-
diction. This authority has heretofore been vested
in the Board of the Foreign Service, a statutory
board set up under the provisions of the Foreign
Service Act of 1946.

tion Agency is hereby authorized to carry out the func~

801 et seq.), with respect to personnel appointed or as-
signed for service in the United States Information Agency
under the provisions of such Act, as amended: Provided,
that nothing herein contained shall be construed as trans-
ferring to the said Director any function of the said Board
relating to any Foreign Service Ofﬁcer.
Section 2. The Director of the United States Informa-
tion Agency is hereby authorized to prescribe such regula-
tions and issue such orders and instructions, not incon-
sistent with law, as may be necessary or desirable for
carrying out his functions under section 1 of this order.
