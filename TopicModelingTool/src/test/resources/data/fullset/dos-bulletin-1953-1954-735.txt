MAY 4, 1954
DEAR MR. PA'rrsRsON:
Please give my warm greetings to the mem-
bers of the United States Committee for United
Nations Day. I am very happy to learn that
so many important national organizations are
uniting to promote the United Nations as a vital
instrument oi peace, security, and mutual under-
standin .
The ame li hted in San Francisco nine years
a 0 was intended to mark the path of all man-
kind toward the common goal of freedom and uni-
versal peace. The hope and faith symbolized by
that ﬂame must derive their strength from more
than material things. That strength must come
from the hearts and minds of the world’s people,
as well as from the resources of governments and
their treasuries.
In your dedicated efforts to keep this ﬂame—
this hope and this faith—burning brightly among
our countrymen, you have my earnest wish for
success.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
