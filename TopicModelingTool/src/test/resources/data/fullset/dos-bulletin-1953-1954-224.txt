of other, less stable countries. Therefore, the
foreign economic policy of the United States is of
worldwide signiﬁcance.”
Need for Increased Purchasing Power
I think we must admit the force of what the
Japanese say. I might add one thing. I would
say that what is most required, if the economies
of Japan and other nations de eudent on a large
volume of foreign trade are to e viable, is a con-
tinuing rise in the urchasin power of the free
world—and particu arly, so fiir as Japan is con-
cerned, in Southeast Asia. This can be accom-
plished by increasing capital investment and con-
tinued technological progress. Removin bar-
riers to international trade will also in itse f tend
to increase the productivity and hence the pur-
chasing power of the trading nations by encour-
aging each to produce those things which it can
reduce most efﬁciently. At the same time, this
increased purchasing power will lead to further
international trade.
The report of the Randall, Commission on
United States Foreign Economic Polic released
last week makes im ortant recommen ations on
the subjects we are iscussing.‘ Amon these are
that our technical cooperation program pressed
forward vigorously, that our Government con-
tribute all it can to the creation abroad of a cli-
mate conducive to private foreign investment, and
that our Government extend oans to countries
where substantial economic aid is necessary in our
interests and cannot be provided by private or
international sources. I might add that it is by
a plying such licies asthese to Southeast Asia
tlli)at we could 0 most to brin about an increas-
ingly fruitful economic re ationship between
Southeast Asia and J a an. But the recommenda-
tions of the Randall emission with the closest
bearing on our policy toward Japan are that our
customs procedures should be sim liﬁed and that
the President should be authorize to reduce our
tariﬂ's by 5 percent per year for 3 years and to
effect larger reductions in the case of goods on
which the tariff is manifestly dis roportionately
high. \Ve have lowered our tari s but we must
lower them further, not out of charity for foreign
producers but in appreciation of our self-interest.
The economic gains of trade between two countries

accrue to both. Every dollar Japan makes selling
to us she will spend buying from us.
Moreover—and this might be even more signiﬁ-
cant—the enactment of trade agreement legisla-
tion enabling the United States to take the lead
in reducing world trade barriers generally would
be of tremendous assistance to Japan. The Jap-
ancse Government has taken the view that its ac-
cession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade—inelegantly known as GA'i'r—by which the
partici ating nations guarantee one another most-
aVOl‘8( -nation treatment, would be the most bene-
ﬁcial single step Japan could take toward obtain-
ing guarantees of nondiscriminatory treatment for
its exports. We agree. Also of great si niﬁcance
in Japan’s foreign trade prospects wou d be the
opportunity for Japan to enter into trade agree-
ment negotiations with the individual contractin
parties to GA'I'I‘ for the purpose of reducin tariﬁlé
on a reciprocal basis. It is essential t iat the
United States continue to lead other countries in
such multilateral eﬂ'orts.
Quite apart, however, from the matter of proﬁt
in international trade, we must consider the para-
mount interest we have in the economic health of
the free nations. The economic collapse of Japan,
with all the consequences that must follow from it,
could mean something like disaster for the free
world. There is no excuse for us not to be per-
fectly clear upon this point. Perhaps no decision
we make in 1054 will be more crucial than those we
make with respect to our treatment of imports.
The issue at stake is the same issue that was at
stake on the battleﬁelds of Korea: the defense and
strengthenin of the free world. W'e shall see it
demonstrated whether it is easier in our society
to send 30,000 of our youths to their death or to
expose our domestic producers to an increased
competition that all but a small minority could
take in their stride and that the consuming public
would beneﬁt from. This is puttin the question
in harsh terms, but the realities we 51cc are them-
selves of an unrelenting harshness.
I have set forth in general terms what our policy
is toward Japan up to the present and I have sug-
gested what many well-informed persons believe
is required in the future. Both the Japanese and
we in the United States are facin crucial de-
cisions. What we must hope is that tliese decisions
will be made in the two countries on the basis of
the actual alternatives that offer and with full
ggﬁrd for the realities that mean so much to us
