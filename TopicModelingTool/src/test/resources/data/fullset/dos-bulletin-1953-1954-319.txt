Indian Custodial Forces
In Korea Commended
White Houee press release dated February 19
F allowing; is the text of a personal message from.
President Eisenhower delivered by Ambassador
George V. Allen to Prime Minister Nehru of India
on February 19:
DEAR MR. Puma Mnns'ran: Now that the mis-
sion of Indian troops is drawing to a close in
Korea, I want to express to you my appreciation
and that of my countrymen for the performance
of the Indian Custodial Forces.
N 0 military unit in recent years has undertaken
a more delicate and demanding peacetime mission
than that faced by the Indian forces in Korea.
The vast majority of risoners placed in their
charge had from mont s of imprisonment and
uncertaint become highl nervous and volatile.
The conﬁdence inspired y the exemplary tact,
fairness and ﬁrmness shown by the Indian ofﬁcers
and men led by their two able commanders, Lt.
General Thimayya and Major General Thorat did
much to alleviate the fears and doubts of these
prisoners. The performance of these ofﬁcers and
their troops was fully in keeping with the high
reputation of the Indian Army. They deserve
the hi hest commendation.
Wit best wishes,
Sincerely,
Dwron'r D. EISENHOW‘ER
