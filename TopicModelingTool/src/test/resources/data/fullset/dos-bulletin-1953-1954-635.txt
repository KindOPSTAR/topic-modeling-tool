widespread interest should result in more publi-
cations, more travel plans, more projects, and
more sponsors.
Mass media, the travel agencies, and the trans-
portation companies are especially im ortant chan-
nels of inﬂuence on individual trave ers. Within
the natural limitations of what they can do, they
would doubtless welcome suggestions as to what
more can be done. The same thing is no doubt
true of publishers and authors of travel books and
guides and the travel editors of newspapers and
magazines. Many techniques developed by the
sponsors of organized travel might be considered
for their applicability to individual travelers. In
fact, the mere exchange of information and experi-
ence amon all interested agencies and organiza-
tions woul undoubtedly pay dividends.
Needless to say, all who are interested in this
problem should keep in mind that effective under-
standin of other peoples is not necessarily best
attaine by head-on attack. On the contrary, it
is more often a byproduct of other, more speciﬁc
activity. Nor is a true picture of this country—
its aims and motives—best achieved by mere talk;
conduct counts for far more. They should also
season their plans, activities, and aims with some
such thoughts as Dr. Samuel Johnson’s. “The use
of travel,” he said, “is to regulate the imagination
with reality and, instead of thinking of how things
may be, to see them as they are.”

Conversations in London and Paris
Concerning lndochlna
Statement by Secretary Dulles ‘
White House press release dated April 19
I have reported to President Eisenhower on my
recent trip to London and Paris, where I discussed
the position in Indochina.
I found in both Capitals recognition that the
armed Communist threat endangered vital free
world interest and made it appropriate that the
free nations most immediate] concerned should
explore the possibility of esta lishing a collective
defense. This same recognition had already been
expressed by other nations of the Southeast Asian
area.
The Communists in Viet-Nam, spurred on by
Red China, have acted on the assumption that a
wok, easy victory at Dien-Bien-Phu would open
t e door to a rapid Communist advance to domi-
nation of the entire Southeast Asian area. They
concluded they were justiﬁed in recklessly squan-
dering the lives of their subjects to conquer this

strongpoint so as to confront the Geneva Confer-
ence With what could be portrayed as both a mili-
tar and olitical victory for communism.
he ga lant defenders of Dien-Bien-Phu have
done their part to assure a frustration of the Com-
munist strategy. They have taken a toll such that,
from a military standpoint, the attackers already
lost more than the could win. From a olitical
standpoint, the de enders of Dien~Bien-P iu have
dramatized the struggle for freedom so that the
free world sees more clearly than ever before the
issues that are at stake and once again is drawing
closer together in unity of pur ose.
The Communist rulers are earning again that
the will of the free is not broken by violence or
intimidation.
The brutal Soviet conquest of Czechoslovakia
did not disintegrate the will of the West. It led
to the formation of the North Atlantic Treaty
alliance.
The violent conquest of the China mainland fol-
lowed by the Korean gression did not paralyze
the will of the free nations. It led to a series of
Paciﬁc mutual security acts and to the creation
under the North Atlantic Treaty of a powerful
defensive force-in-being. _
The violent battles now being waged in Viet-
Nam and the armed aggressions against Laos and
Cambodia are not creating any spirit of defeatism.
On the contra , they are rousing the free nations
to measures which we hope Will be sufﬁciently
timely and vigorous to preserve these vital areas
from Communist domination.
In this course lies the best hope of achieving at
Geneva the restoration of peace with freedom and
justice.
In addition to discussin with the President the
situation in Indochina, reported to him with
reference to the Korean base of the forthcoming
Geneva Conference whic opens on A ril 26.
At Berlin the Soviet Union agree that “the
establishment by peaceful means, of a united and
independent Korea would be an important factor
in reducing international tension and in restoring
peace in other parts of Asia.” ’ To achieve_that
oal is the purpose of the conference which Wlll _be
ﬁeld between the representatives of the SOViet
Union and of the Chinese and North Korean Com-
munist regimes, and the representatives of 16
nations which articipated, under the United Na-
tions Comman , in the defense of the Republic of
Korea.
The United States, working in close consulta-
tion with the Republic of Korea and the represent-
atives of the other allied nations, will adhere
steadfastly to this purpose of establishin by
peaceful means a united and independent orea.
I also discussed with President Eisenhower the
prospective meetin of the NATO ministerial coun-
cil to be held in aris on April 23. Since the
military program for NATO has now been estab-
