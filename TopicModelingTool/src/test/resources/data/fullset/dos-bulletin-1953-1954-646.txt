ated in the Tiquisate area ($6,984,223) and for
resulting damage to the value of properties not
expropriated, or severance damages ($8,737,600).
The claim sets forth that the Government of
Guatemala by a resolution of March 5, 1953, or-
dered the expropriation of 233,973 acres of the
company’s land near Tiquisate, in the west coast
region of Guatemala, of which 26 584 acres were
described in the expropriation or er as excess or
untitled lands.
The company states in its claim that beginning
in 1928 it purchased a total of over 302,000 acres
in the west coast region of Guatemala for $3,130,-
634.55' and that it had made a total investment
in facilities and betterments on its west coast prop-
erties between 1936 and December 31, 1952, of
$25,942,026.58.
The company states that due to the presence of
the Panama Disease and other factors, and the
consequent need for reserve banana lands, the ex-
propriation of lands carried out in March 1953
rastically shortened the life of the entire enter-
prise including that of the betterments, and gave
rise to the claim for damage to the value of prop-
erties not ex ropriated (severance damages), in
addition to tie claim for the value of the lands
and betterments actually expropriated.
The present claim has no reference to the expro-
priation of 172,532 acres of land belonging to the
United Fruit Company near Bananera on the Car-
ibbean slope of Guatemala, which was announced
on February 24, 1954.
