ﬁeld for its efforts than ever before. Global
markets might even replace domestic markets. In
any event, t 0 opportunities for overall expansion
rather than contraction will be within the realms
of probability and possibility.
am therefore, certain that our basic objec-
tives—the ﬁrm attachment of allies through
mutual trade and a strong domestic economy—are
not inconsistent. I am e ually conﬁdent that, un-
less the individual problems are tested by such
guide-lines, we will end up in a hodgepodge of
compromises and contradictions. What is worse,
we will make bad mistakes.

Statement by Secretary Dulles 1
I appreciate the privilege of ap earing before
you today in su port of the Mutua Security Pro-
gram for ﬁsca year 1955. This program is a
major instrument of our U. S. foreign olicy.
Other witnesses will discuss with you its d)etails.
I shall deal primaril with the relation of this
pro am to our overallIforeign policies.
T e pro ram responds to our recognition of the
following asic facts:
1. The Soviet and Chinese Communist rulers
are continuing to seek world domination. Noth-
ing has happened to indicate any change in this
purpose. 5 a part of their expansionist pro-
gram, they continue to maintain vast military
establishments, huge ro aganda machines, and
the control of powerfu su versive elements in the
free nations.
2. The danger to our national security is neither
a short-term danger nor is it exclusively military.
For this reason, we must strive to hold our security
commitments to levels which are compatible with
our economic and social health. The same is true
of our allies.
3. The United States cannot gain security in
isolation, but only through a system of collective
defense. Our survival depends upon keeping the

ties of foreign investments, “Buy American” re-
strictions, and that mysterious phenomenon called
the “dollar gap” cannot be dealt with separately
or without relation to some basic principles. Even
the experts on those subjects are helpless unless
they know the end results we wish to attain. I do
not know how much, when, or in respect of what
items the tariff rates should be modlﬁed. But I
am conﬁdent that very little expert difﬁculty will
be experienced in determinin the appropriate
tariff schedules if we test all so utions by the basic
principles outlined. Therefore, if we identify and
establish the fundamentals and insist on adherence
to them, trade policy can be bent to augment mili-
tary strength in the present and the future.
spiritual and material resources of other free na-
tions out of Soviet hands, and upon maximizing
the contribution which other free nations can make
to the struggle against communism.
4. A number of free-World countries cannot
maintain the military strength and the economic
stability which they must have in their own in-
terest—and which we want them to have in ours—
unless we help them. Our help must be devised
to meet their need—militarily in some countries,
economic in others.
These are continuing rinciples. They under-
lie the Mutual Security grogram and the request
for authority to continue it for the coming year.
Let me now discuss brieﬂy some of the ma]or de-
velo ments of the past year in the principal areas
of t 1e world and the major factors affecting the
program in these areas in the coming year.
Europe
As you know, one of our most signiﬁcant and
successful ventures in collective security is the
14-nation Atlantic alliance. NATO not only has
created considerable local defensive power, but
also provides the facilities needed to implement
our broad deterrent policies. Under NATO, we
and our allies have developed an extensive system
of bases and facilities which are shared in com-
