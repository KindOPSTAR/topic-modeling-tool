December 1950 to be the Supreme Commander of
the Allied Powers, and under his ins iration there
was developed military strength in urope. Now
that there 1s at least a reasonable defensible pos-
ture in sight, that ex ense is being leveled off.
I think it would e very difficult for any im-
artial observer to say that the North Atlantic
reaty, or the organizations under it, have
created the division of Europe. It has been re-
sponsive to a division of Europe which already
existed and the danger of which was accentuated
by such events as I have outlined.
The Soviet Foreign Minister has asked us to
study and analyze the precise words and drafting
of his project. I must say in all frankness that
I am not interested in the words. I could heap
this table high with past words that are just as
ﬁne as the human hand and mind can pen. I
have referred to some of them this afternoon.
What I ask is, “Will these words bring with them
conﬁdence?” The words already exist; they exist
in the United Nations Charter. They have ex-
isted in many other documents. The essence is
not the words, but whether in fact the proposal
will brin a conﬁdence which will end the dis-
unity of urope.
I can say with, I ho e, assurance that I will
be believed, that there is no international objec-
tive which is as dear to the hearts of the Ameri-
can people as real peace and security in Europe.
That ought to be our wish, because the lack of
that has cost us very dearly and very heavily in
the past.
lnadoquacy of Formula of Words
I have, however, grown skeptical of the possi-
bility of solving great problems merely by re-
ating old words or inventin new words. I
0 not believe, myself, that the dlVlSlOI'l of Europe,
which so desperately needs to be cured, can be
cured by a formula of words. I believe there are
some things which need to be done ﬁrst.
One of the thin s that needs to be done is to
end the division 0 Germany. Here is a problem
which is our own articular problem. It lies
here on this table; 1t is symbolized by the city
in which we meet. And yet we seem unable to
even make that start in ending the division of
Europe.
Mr. Eden has laid before us a lan for the uni-
ﬁcation of Germany,‘ a reasona le plan which,
unha pily, it seems is not acceptable. And I
woul be forced in all candor to say that the
reasons which make it impossible for us four to
agree u on the uniﬁcation of Germany are pre-
cisely t e reasons which deprive the ﬁne words
which are resented in the Soviet proposal 5 of
the value w iich I wish deeply they carried.
What is the reason that makes the United

' I bid., Feb. 22, 1954, p. 270.
Kingdom’s plan unacceptable? It is because it is
based upon having supervised free elections in
Germany and one of us four is not willing to
trust the results of these elections. That is why
the perpetuation of the division must go on.
There is unhappily a lon histo which sug-
gests that the rulers of the oviet Union are not
willing to trust anything which they cannot them-
selves control. That is the reason, it seems to me,
fundamentally why we around this table have
been unable to bring about the uniﬁcation of Ger-
many. And I say if that ground for distrust
exists and if there cannot be unity except by con-
trol, control by the Soviet Union, then I am very
skeptical if any good can come out of the plan
whlch has been submitted by the Soviet Foreign
Minister.
STATEMENT OF FEBRUARY 16
Press release 7'ﬂ dated February 18
Mr. Chairman, for about 2,000 years now there
has been a ﬁgure in mythology which symbolizes
tragic futility. That was Sisyphus, who, accord-
ing to the Greek story, was given the task of rolling
a great stone up to the top of a hill. Each time
when, after great struggle and sweating, the stone
was just at the brow of the hill, some evil force
manifested itself and pushed the stone down. So
poor Sisyphus had to start his task over again.
I suspect that for the next 2,000 years the story
of Sisyphus will be forgotten, when generation
after generation is told the story, the tragic story,
of the Austrian State Treaty. Austria was prom-
ised its independence 11 years ago. When our
forces moved into Austria 9 years ago they an-
nounced that they were there only to liberate.
Now, year after year has gone by, when we have
repeatedl been almost at the oint of concludin
an Austrian state treaty, and) always some evi
force manifests itself and pushes the treaty back
a ain. So we have to start a ain from the bottom
0 the hill. That is again t e tragedy being re-
peated here today.
I recall that when we were in Moscow in 1947,
7 years ago, an Austrian State Treaty was almost
concluded as the result of the work which the
deputies had been carrying on in London some 6
months previously, and we thought then that an
Austrian state treaty was in si ht.
Again it went down to the ottom of the hill.
And the deputies worked and worked for the
succeeding 2 years, and ﬁnally again it seemed to
be on the point of realization. And at our meeting
in Paris in 1949 it was so near to completion that
it seemed that the deputies could conclude it within
a few days.
Then began again the series of efforts, and ﬁrst
one excuse after another was brought forward—
Yugoslavia, Trieste, the Soviet claim for payment
for the dried peas, and ﬁnally, when no more
excuses could be thought of, the Soviet Union sud-
