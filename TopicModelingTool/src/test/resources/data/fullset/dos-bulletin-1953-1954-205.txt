“force” the Jordan Valley plan on the Arab -
ples, but rather that it was presenting for t eir
consideration a project sincerely believed to be in
their best interests.
Ambassador Eric Johnston reported to Presi-
dent Eisenhower on his mission to the Near East
on November 17, 1953. Mr. Johnston said that
the Governments he visited had promised to give
“the most careful study” to the proposed Jordan
Valley development plan drawn up at the request
of UNRWA. He reported that the attitude he en-
countered “gave him reason to believe that, after
serious scrutiny, the roject will commend itself
to the states concerne as a sound and constructive
ap roach to some of the most critical issues con-
tri uting to present tensions in the area.” He
looked forward to returning to the interested cap-
itals early in 1954 for further discussions. Presi-
dent Eisenhower and Secretary Dulles both ex-
pressed gratiﬁcation at his report.
During 1953 we continued our program of as-
sisting Israel to become a self-sustaining member
of the Near Eastern community. You will recall
that on October 28 last, Secretary Dulles noted
the release of $2614 million of grant-in-aid funds
to Israel for this purpose. We are also continu-
ing a particularly effective program of technical
amistance in Israel. These and other develop-
ments indicate the friendly relationship existing
between the United States and Israel.
However, when the Government of Israel an-
nounced that it had moved its Foreign Ministry
to Jerusalem Secreta Dulles in a press con-
ference on J uiy 28, 1953, said: “The United States
regrets that the Israeli Government has seen ﬁt to
move its Foreign Ofﬁce from Tel Aviv to Jeru-
salem,” and he noted that the United States had
previously made known its feelings to Israel on
this matter. Mr. Dulles reiterated that the United
Nations “has a primary res nsibility for deter-
mining the future status of erusalem.”
Throughout the year the border between Israel
and her neighbors continued to be the scene of
incidents. The most serious of these was the at-
tack by Israeli armed forces on the Jordanian
village of Qibya on the night of October 14-15,
1953. The United Nations Security Council took
up the Arab-Israel border situation at the joint re-
quest of the United States, Great Britain, and
rance. At a meeting of the United Nations Se-
curity Council on November 9, 1953, the United
States, Great Britain, and France expressed agree-
ment that the Israeli attack on Qibya was a serious
violation of the Palestine armistice and on Novem-
ber 20, 1953, the United States, Great Britain, and
France formally presented to the United Nations
Security Council a joint resolution expressing
strong censure of Israel for the Qibya raid and
calling on both Israel and Jordan to respect their
armistice a ment, a resolution which was
adopted by t e Council 4 days later.
On October 20, 1953, Secretary Dulles had an-
nounced deferment of economic aid to Israel. The
action was taken, he said, because of Israel’s re-
fusal to comply with the request of the United
Nations Chief of Staﬂ' in Palestine, General Ben-
nike, to suspend work on the Banat Ya’qub diver-
sion project on the Jordan River.
On October 28, 1953, Israel agreed to stop work
on the building of the Banat Ya’qub diversion
canal pendin consideration of the question by
the Securit éouncil. Secretary Dulles thereupon
recommem ed that U.S. economic aid to Israel
be resumed and said, “The golicy of the United
States to support the United ations Truce Super-
vision Organization in this matter has thus been
realized, and the impediment to the present grant
of economic aid to Israel has been removed.” He
said that programs for economic aid to other
states of the Near East “are in an advance state
of formulation and it is expected that some of
them can shortly be announced.” Unfortunately
the Banat Ya’qub issue is still unsettled.
U.S. Stand on Colonlallsm
In the ﬁrst major statement of U.S. policy on
colonialism to be made in many years, Assistant
Secretary Byroade, speaking at Asilomar Califor-
nia, on October 31, 1953,8 emphasized merican
support and interest in the orderly achievement of
self-government for peoples now under foreign
rule. Mr. Byroade pointed out that the U.S.
colonial policy is relatively simple: “We believe,”
he said, “in eventual self-determination for all
peoples, and we believe that evolutionary develop-
ment to this end should move forward with mini-
mum delay.”
In further reference to colonialism, Secretary
Dulles said on November 18, 1953, “There is no
slightest wavering in our conviction that the or-
derly transition from colonial to self-governing
status should be carried resolutely to a comple-
tion.” In his speech before the annual convention
of the C10, he disclosed that the United States
Government is “pushing for self-government more
than appears on the surface.” Where the U.S.
appears to be exercising restraint, Mr. Dulles
pointed out, “it is because of a reasoned conviction
that precipitate action would in fact not produce
independence but only transition to a captivity
far worse than present dependence.” On the other
hand, he said, “we are alert to the possibility that
the Communist threat might grow into an excuse
for delay, when it is not an honest reason for
delay.”
On November 11 President Eisenhower sent the
following message to King Saud al Send, the new
King of Saudi Arabia:
