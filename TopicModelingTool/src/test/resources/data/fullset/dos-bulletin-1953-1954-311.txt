International Bank Makes
Loan in Ecuador
The International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development on February 10 made a loan of
$8,500,000 for a highway construction program in
Ecuador. The program is designed to stimulate
the development 0 agricultural production in
the Province of Guayas and neighboring parts of
the coastal re ion.
This is the ank’s ﬁrst loan in Ecuador. It was
made to the Comite Ejecutivo de Vialidad de la
Provincia del Guayas, an autonomous local au-
thority, charged With responsibility for develop-
ing a road system for the Province of Guayas
and port facilities for Guayaquil. The loan is
for a term of 10 years and ears interest of 45/8
percent per annum, including the 1 percent com-
mission which will be allocated to the bank’s
special reserve. Amortization will begin on
March 1, 1958. The loan is guaranteed by the
Government of Ecuador.
The coastal region lying in Guayas and neigh-
boring provinces produces most of Ecuador’s cot-
ton, rice and sugar, as well as the bulk of the chief
export crops—bananas, cacao and coffee. The
region comprises about 17 million acres of land.
It is extremely fertile but only about 1.25 mil-
lion acres are under cultivation. The chief 0b-
stacle to further cultivation is the difﬁculty of
transportation in the area. Existing roads are
for the most part unpaved and become impassable
in the 5-months wet season, with the result that
perishable produce is wasted. Transportation
costs of export crops from production centers to
the ports, even in dry weather, are extremely high,
in some instances as much as 200 percent of the
value of products at their source.
Under the highwa construction program, eight
of the existing roa s radiating from Guayaquil,
Ecuador’s largest city and its most im ortant port,
will be converted to all-weather hig ways. The
individual roads to be built under the program will
have a total length of about 365 miles. The roads
are to be integrated with a national highway net-
work being planned by the National Government
and will contribute toward making year-round
transportation possible between Guayaquil and
Quito, Ecuador’s two chief cities. The program
also includes (a) the construction of a central
maintenance shop for the repair and overhaul of
construction equipment; (6) the building of a
sus nsion bridge over the Daule River which will
be t e ﬁrst suspension bridge as well as the longest
bridge in Ecuador; and (c) the acquisition of car
ferries for use between Guayaquil and Duran. The
inauguration of ferry service will for the ﬁrst time
make possible the trans ortation of trucks, auto-
mobiles and possibly railroad cars between these
two cities. Duran is across the Guayas River from
Guayaquil and is the terminus of the railroad from
Quito, the ca ital, and of many important roads.
The new highways can be expected to open new
lands to cultivation and to ermit the more effec-
tive use of lands now un er cultivation. Past
experience in Guayas Province shows that land in
the vicinity of new highways is immediately
cleared for cultivation and that the construction
of feeder roads quickly leads to the development of
new lands. It is estimated that by the time the
project is completed, production of Ecuador’s
export crops wi l have increased by about 50 per-
cent over recent levels and that the resultin in-
creases in foreign exchange earnings wi be
substantially more than will be needed to service
the bank’s loan.
The program is expected to take about 4 years
to com lete. It will cost a total of 179 million
sucres equivalent to $11.8 million) including the
foreign exchange component being ﬁnanced by
the bank.
Export-Import Bank Loan
to New Zealand
The Export-Import Bank of Washington on
Februar 13 announced authorization of a loan of
$16 million to the Government of New Zealand to
assist in ﬁnancing the purchase of US. materials,
equipment, and services for the Murupara roject
for the production of lumber, chemical pul) , and
newsprint in that country.
The total cost of the Murupara project is esti-
mated at the equivalent of about $84 million. Of
this amount, approximately $41 million will be
required for the lumber, chemical pulp, and news-
print mills to be constructed for and 0 erated b
the Tasman Pulp and Paper Com any, ftd, which
initially will receive temporary linancial backing
from the New Zealand Government. The remain-
ing $13 million will be required for the ancillary
services, such as housing and expansion of railway,
power, and harbor facilities, which will be pro-
vided by the Government itself.
About one-third of the loan will provide the
dollar exchange with which the Tasman Pulp and
Paper Company, Ltd, will obtain materials, equip-
ment, and services in the United States for use
in the mills now under construction. With the
remaining two-thirds of the loan the New Zealand
Government will ﬁnance purchases in the United
