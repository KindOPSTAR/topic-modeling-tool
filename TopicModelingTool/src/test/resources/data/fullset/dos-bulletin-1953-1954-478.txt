on sanitar measures in the processing and mar-
keting of rozen clams for export. At the request
of the Government of Sin a ore, the Depart-
ment arranged for the U.§ ureau 0f Recla-
mation to test soil samples. The Department of
Agriculture produced a quantity of guayule seeds
for Spain. Continued assistance was provided
Australia and Thailand in developing the Snowy
Mountains Hydroelectric project and the Chao
Phy River Dam. In connmtion with the latter
project, arrangements were made to train 10 Aus-
tralian and 2 Thai engineers.
THE PROGRAM AROUND THE WORLD
In Europe
The friendship between the United States and
the nations of free Europe is well established.
There are, however, in all of the European coun-
tries, and articularl in several, groups either
hostile to t e United tates or ignorant of Amer-
can ways. The Kremlin makes a constant effort to
use these roups in its efforts to divide the United
States and its European allies.
Since July 1, 1953, the Department has brought
3,738 Europeans to this country and has assisted
private groups in brin ing over an additional 466.
These exchanges inc ude, for example, such in-
dividuals as the General Secretary of the Central
Federation of Finnish Trade Unions, the Presi-
dent of the Swedish Social-Democratic Youth
Federation, and such other key ﬁgures as inﬂuen-
tial newsmen, members of national legislatures,
and government ofﬁcials.
The carrying out of“ exchanges within the
framework of projects to accomplish speciﬁc ob-
jectives has been particularly effective in Europe.
The inﬂuence of groups of NATO newsmen who
have returned home show this. For example, they
have written favorable articles appearing in over
150 major European newspapers, with a circula-
tion of several million readers. Their accounts
have been carried by many European radio and
television networks, wire services, and magazines.
Typical of a project designed for a specific coun-
try was the visit of nine Cooperative Community
Action Teams from Germany. These teams, com-
posed of community leaders from German towns,
visited comparable American communities, par-
ticipating in community activities and interview-
ing community oﬁicials.‘
Upon their return home these teams found
many ways to explain the United States to their
fellow citizens. For example, members of a team
from Muenster, Germany, since their return, have
given 75 talks to their townsmen. They have pro-
posed plans for the administrative reorganization

lication 5106), p. 18.
of the cit along the lines of American advances
in city p anning and administration. In addi-
tion, they have recommended the inclusion of
American studies in the schools and the estab-
lishment of a Muenster-American Circle. The
urpose of the latter will be to maintain continu-
ing contacts between Muenster and the American
cities visited by the team.
Rich dividends have also resulted from the
Conferences on American Studies held in Nor-
way, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.
These meetings centered around such themes as
“The U. S. in the Atlantic Community,” “The
American Labor Movement,” and “American
Literature.” Prominent American lecturers led
these discussions, in which foreign university
faculty members, teachers, students, and many
others participated. Many of the foreign par-
ticipants came with serious reservations as to
whether this would be a ropaganda stunt on the
part of the Americans. early all of them ended
up by praising the conferences and asking for
more.
Among the 1,468 American exchan ees now in
Europe are 917 American students, w 0 have en-
tered into student and university circles in 13
countries, forming an important link between the
United States and European outh oups.
These students were carefully selected t rough
wide and stiff competitions, stressing personality
and emotional suitability as well as professional
competence.
American s cialists assigned to Europe in-
cluded the Labiir Commissioner of the State of
\Vyoming, who went down into mines accom-
panied by members of local labor organizations
and out into the ﬁelds to talk with workers about
their problems. He was given a good press every-
where except in Communist papers.
The Department was also active in encouraging
and supporting the visits to Europe of rivately
sponsored American groups and in ividuals
whose trips would contribute to exchan e objec-
tives. Among these were the American ational
Ballet Theatre, the New York City Ballet, and se-
lected American musical groups and individual
artists. They are creating a new res ect for
American artistic achievement in areas t at have
long regarded this country as lacking in cultural
values.
The ballet was so completely successful that the
Communist ress, which habitually derides
American artlstic attainments, was forced to 've
favorable reviews. Other critics highly praised
the performances and described the development
of ballet in America from an essentially European
art into a uniquely American form today on par
with the best Europe has to offer.
The potential effect of the Department’s ex-
change eﬁ'orts in this area may be gaged by study-
ing past exchanges. For example, evaluation
studies in one large European country show that
