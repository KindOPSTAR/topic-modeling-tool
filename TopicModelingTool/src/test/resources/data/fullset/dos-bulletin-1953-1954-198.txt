food out ut. But, today, 37 years after the revo-
lution, oviet agriculture has 8 million fewer
cattle than before the revolution.
The imposition of Soviet theories on the farm
population has reduced the people to a marginal
evel of survival. The ﬁrst systematic attempt in
the 1930's to force the farming ple to conform
to Communist agricultural policies ended in the
martyrdom of some 6 million peasants and the
collectivization of all the rich farm lands. Since
that time the regime has exercised complete domi-
nation over every waking hour of the farmer’s
existence.
Little wonder then that the life span of the
average Soviet male is only 50 years.
But the satellites are equally aﬁ'ected. Let me
give you two examples:
Two years ago the courts in Czechoslovakia
dealt swiftly With 8 young men charged with
being members of “a inilitarist organization en-
gaged in treason, espionage, and conspiracy
against our working class.” One received a life
sentence. The terms of the others totaled 127
years—an average sentence of 18 years.
What was their crime? The crime was that
they had never publicly renounced their member-
ship in the Boy Scouts. They got of! lightly at
that. According to Czech Communist law, sen-
tence to a slave labor camp can be invoked for
what they call “deviationism” if the accused is
above the age of 12!
Even the joys of Christmas can be considered
dangerous in the Soviet Union and its satellites.
I quote from the handbook of the Library for
Young Atheists, which every young Soviet Pio-
neer must memorize to prepare himself for adult
Party leadership: “The struggle against Christ-
mas trees is the struggle against religion and
against our class enemies.”
For this audience, I do not have to icture how
different are life and opportunities ere in the
United States, on the soil of freedom. You and
I know of our opportunities under freedom. You
and I know that, in the main, our abilities will
measure how far our ambitions can take us in
politics and law and medicine and farming.
Provln; the Beneﬁts of Freedom
But the somber note in our way of life today is
that we must take on the global problem of 00-
ing that our way oﬁ'ers abundantly more ne-
ﬁts than communism. \Ve must make known to
the peoples of the world our knowledge and our
convictions about freedom.
We must make it clear that the idea of freedom
is a better idea, that the free system is a better
system. And we must do this in many places,
competing side by side with the idea and the
system of communism.
That’s why your Government operates a world-
wide overseas information program throu h the
new U.S. Information Agency. It is our jo , ﬁrst
of all, to unite the peoples of the free world against
communism without war and to persuade other
peoples to the side of frwdom. Secondly, we
must enlighten the peoples behind the Iron Cur-
tain with facts—the facts about the outside world,
the facts inside their own world. Further, we
must bring to the captive peoples of satellite
Europe and Asia a message of hope that true lib-
ertv will be restored to them once again.
That’s why the radio service of the Agency,
known to you as the Voice of America, devotes
three-fourths of its total effort to reach the people
behind the Iron Curtain. Radio is the only sure
means of reaching these people, and we use it to
give them the news of the free world, objectively,
factually.
That’s wh the ress service of the new Agency
ﬁlls the nee s of t e free world by sending daily
background news items over a wireless ﬁle to our
ﬁeld posts in 76 countries. This service also in-
cludes 75 million publications of all kinds which
are distributed each year throughout the world.
These are read by hundreds of millions of peo le.
That’s why we have located library and in or-
mation centers in some 63 countries of the world.
They rovide a meetin place for people of all ages
and a l rofessions w io want to learn about the
United tates and the free world.
That‘s wh we use motion pictures. perhaps the
most compelling medium, to portray the free world
and to show up communism. The ministries of
education in a number of countries now rely on
our ﬁlms for all t es of instruction. In France
the ﬁlms pmyiaretlliy the Agency have such gree-
tige that they are distributed through the o cial
agency of national education.
Jaye.“ at the Glymplca
One of our ﬁlms is the “Junior Chamber of
Commerce.” It was produced in 32 languages.
It centers around a young businessman from a city
in Texas, who sets about organizing better play-
ground facilities in his community. It is one
of our most eﬁ'ective shows. During the 1952
Olympic games in Finland, this ﬁlm played to
capacitv audiences. About 30,000 persons saw. it
there. Right across the street, a very active Soviet
cultural program was playing its tunes.
Finally, to get across our story, that’s why we
have more than 30,000 foreign students studying
on 1,400 American college campuses. Most 0
them are brought here under the exchangepro-
gram of the Department of State and private
auspices. They get the best knowledge possible of
freedom: the knowledge gained from ﬁrsthand
observation of Americans at work, at play, at
worship.
That’s why, in short, we combine all the means
of communications to serve our objectives abroad.
These efforts by the U.S. Information Agency,
however, can be strengthened immeasurably With
the active aid of private organizations. Already
