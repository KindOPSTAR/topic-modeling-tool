washing” to a ﬁne science to secure useful, if
false, confessions from prisoners and has even
directed it against its own nationals to secure in
recalcitrant cases the complete obedience and
conformity which must characterize the “new
socialist man.” The regime has liquidated mil-
lions of its own citizens, b means ranging from
outright murder to induce suicide, in its attacks
on private businessmen and in the spurious land
reform program which brought it early support
from the unsuspectin peasants but which is now,
as control of the land is taken over by the state,
bringing it the mute and impotent hostility of the
dispossessed farmers. There is not only no free-
dom of eech, press, or assembly; there is not
even free om of silence, since all must be vocal
in their support of Communist policies.
The regime has set about painstakingl to
change the whole fabric of traditional Chinese
society. Through endless study groups it has
attem ted to reach every citizen, in the attempt
to ma e his thoughts and acts conform to the sup-
posed needs of the Party. These study groups
involve lectures by Communist cadres, the reading
of prescribed texts, and “discussion.” The lec-
tures invariably contain the “ri ht” answers to the
problem at hand, but hours an often even weeks
are then spent in endless discussions which are
preordained to end up right where they started:
with the “right” answers. No segment of the
population is excluded from the Communist pro-
gram of remolding the individual. The soldier is
given special attention, in this as in other matters.
I have talked in Chinese with country boys in the
Chinese Communist Army who could scarcely
phrase a compound sentence on most subjects but
who could hold forth by the hour with astounding
facility on the subjects of dialectical materialism
and the history of Western imperialism, Commu-
nist version.
Even the so-called educational institutions do
not escape the heavy imprint of the political re-
quirements regarded as the current speciﬁc for
the ailments of the Communist state. Academic
research, like religion, the economy, and the pat-
terns of social behavior, is made the handmaiden
of the Communist brand of politics. The family
unit is a special target of the Communists. Chil-
dren are trained to spy and report on their
parents, and they not infrequently have de-
nounced their parents in instances where they
knew it meant the death of their parents.
Finally, the regime, in order to gain sorely needed
foreign exchange, has stooped to trade in narcotics
and to blackmail of overseas Chinese whose rela-
tives on the mainland are at its mercy.
In short, the Mao Tse-tung regime, whose
cause is pled at Geneva by Chou En-lai, internally
is a police state of the worst order and externally
is a convicted aggressor, a continuing threat to
its neighbors, and apparently an enemy of all na-
tions who do not choose to identify themselves
completely with the cam of “peace-loving nations
under the leadership 0 the Soviet Union.” It
is the Communists who insist that there is no
third, middle, or neutral road. All who are not
for them are considered to be against them. At
least there can be no doubt as to where Communist
China stands, and there should be no room left
for wishful thinking on the subject. Mao Tse-
tung, upon the inception of his regime on October
1, 1949, proclaimed his so-called ‘ lean to one side
licy,” that is, toward the Soviet side. This bids
air to be the understatement of our time. Mao
was less reserved when, upon the death of Stalin,
he sent a telegram to Moscow declaring that Red
China would stand by the Soviet Union “deﬁ-
nitely, forever and with maximum resoluteness.”
This smacks more of prostration than of leaning.
Communist China, it is true, is not in the same
impotent situation in the Communist orbit as are
the Eastern European satellites. The very size,
geographical location, and importance of China
assure it a special status. We cannot read into
this situation any signiﬁcant element of divisive-
ness, however. The very fact of special status
doubtless makes Communist China more comfort-
able in the Soviet camp than it would otherwise
be. In time there may well be increasin frictions
between the Chinese and Russians. ussia has
traditionally had aggressive designs against
China. Difﬁculties may well mount 1n time over
Soviet inﬂuence in China’s Northeast and North-
west, over control of the Communist movement
in the rest of Asia, over Chinese disappointment
at the limitations of Soviet aid commitments, and
perhaps over alleged ideological heresies. For
the foreseeable future, however, the afﬁnities
which bind the two powers together are likely to
be much stronger than the divisive frictions.
Such is the nature of the regime which appears
at Geneva to be making a bid for general recogni-
tion, for entry into the United Nations, and for
freer trade with the WVest. The United States, for
its part, cannot recognize this regime. We will
continue vigorously to oppose its admission to any
United Nations body as the representative of the
Chinese people. And we cannot favor a relaxa-
tion of trade controls justly imposed against a
convicted aggressor which has given no indication
of having altered its aggressive course but on the
contrary remains a constant threat to its neighbors
and desires to build up its industrial base to sup-
port a war machine with the avowed purpose of
“liberating” the rest of the world. \Ve believe
that to do so would, on the one hand, further con-
ﬁrm the Chinese Communists in their dedication
to their present loyalties and courses of action and,
on the other, tend to produce disillusionment and
discouragement on the part of other Asian nations
anxious to maintain their freedom and in many
instances their newly won independence.
