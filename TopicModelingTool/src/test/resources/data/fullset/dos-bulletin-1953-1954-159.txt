countries overseas we have binational commissions
which play an important role in planning suitable
programs for each country, in selecting artici-
pants, and in looking after our grantees while they
are abroad. The participation of leading foreign
nationals and prominent American busmessmen
and educators on these commissions gives great
prestige to the program and gains a ready accept-
ance or the Americans going to these countries.
In this country the program is run in typical
American fashion—as a partnership between the
Government and private enterprise. We could
not run this program effectively for a week with-
out the cooperation of American organizations and
individuals all over the United States. Univer-
sities and colleges and private organizations in
this country contribute direct ﬁnancial support to
this program by giving scholarships to some of the
forei students for whom we ay round trip
trave , or by offeri stipends to fdrei lecturers
and researchers. Ilgn the teacher-axe ange pro-
gram the schools maintain the teachers’ salaries
while they are abroad, and the overseas schools pay
their teachers who are in this country.
A number of private organizations in this coun-
try provide services for the exchange program
under contractual arrangements with the Depart-
ment of State. These services include primary
selection of candidates, placement of foreign can-
didates, and su rvision of some of the exchangees.
Still others herl) in planning suitable itineraries
and professions. contacts for our foreign leaders.
And some oups are under contract to us to make
studies which will help us to measure the effec-
tiveness of the program and improve its operation.
lmllvldual Contrlbutlona
Perhaps the largest single service provided by
voluntary groups in this country is the offerin of
professional guidance and hospitality to our or-
eign guests. There are at present about 1,000
a visers on college campuses who help foreign
students with their problems and an equal number
of advisers who hel Americans who want to apply
for scholarships. It is almost impossible to meas-
ure the dollars and cents value of these services,
but its importance can be realized if you will re-
member that it is you, the citizens of this country,
who are the inter reters of America. The picture
which any one 0 our forei visitors gets of this
count is the sum total ognhis experiences with
indivi ual Americans. We want not only to share
with him our rich educational resources and our
skills, but to give him some insight into the kind
of society we have developed in this country which
makes these resources and skills available to the
majority of people. One of the best ways to do
this is to share our daily life with him so that from
visiting and talking with individual Americans
in their homes, on their farms, in their businesses,
churches and community groups, he can under-
stand the real values of democracy for the average
American.
We in the Educational Exchange Service oﬁer,
on the other hand, various kinds 0 help to private
oups and individuals in the United States who
ﬁlive exchan e projects of their own, so that their
exchange e orts can contribute more effectively
to the national interest. The help which we can
give takes a great variety of forms. Sometimes
it may mean guidance to groups who are (planning
exchange projects, or arranging pre eparture
brieﬁng for Americans visiting sensitive world
areas, or arranging with our posts overseas to
facilitate tours for American groups or indi-
viduals.
Aecornpllahmanta of the Program
At this point it seems reasonable to ask just
what these exchanges are accomplishing. In the
ﬁrst place they are removing false ideas about the
United States and replacing such ideas with more
accurate information about us. A young German
who landed on our shores with some very harsh
criticisms of U.S. fraternities as a breeding
ound for self-styled snobs commented after be
ad been here for a year:
I do not think that I have been assimilated here, that
I have been "Americanized" to any great extent, but I
have found in Sigma Chi a common meeting ground where
1 can be a close friend to Americans and still be a good
German. That may not sound too extraordinary, but
imagine this concept really being applied on a large scale
in international relations.
One of the newsmen from the NATO countries
who came here to see our defense efforts had this
to say about us:
We have been taught that Americans think only of
making money, but I found them real human beings with
a warm feeling for problems in other countries.
In still another ﬁeld, our assistance in arran ing
concerts for the St. Cecilia Choir of Boston w iich
went to Europe under private auspices paid divi-
dends in the following notice in a French news-
paper :
We have always known that the Americans make good
machines. but concerts like this one are convincing us
that they also possess a fully developed culture about
which we know extremely little.
The program is also strengthening our ties with
the free world by sharing our knowledge and
building up skills which are of mutual beneﬁt to
the United States and other countries. A woman
from the Philippines who studied social work in
the United States has succeeded in establishing an
institute of technology in Mindanao modeled very
much after the idea of Berea College in Kentucky
where the system of providing students with an
opportunity to earn their education impressed this
visitor as being adaptable to the needs of her own
people. A German county ofﬁcial who came to
