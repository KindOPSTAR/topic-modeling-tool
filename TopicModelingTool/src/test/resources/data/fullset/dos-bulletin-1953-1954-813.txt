signed, however, with Finland, France, and
Switzerland.
Reports on developments in Germany during
1936 re eat the themes of earlier years : intensiﬁca-
tion of azi political control, Naziﬁcation of edu-
cation, resistance to attempted Nazi control of the
churches, persecution of the Jews. Of special
signiﬁcance is the report of Ambassador William
E. Dodd on September 18 showing how the Nazis
perverted public opinion to the extent that Hitler
could count on the support of the people in any
venture he might undertake (pp. 149—152) .
The correspondence in this volume regarding
the Spanish Civil War is divided into two sections,
one on the international political aspects of the
war and the other on the protection of the lives
and property of Americans and other nationals.
The record here presented shows no deviation from
the publicly announced U.S. policy of strict
neutrality. The Department on August 7 re-
minded all its officers in Spain to maintain a com-
pletely impartial attitude and intimated that all
Americans should patriotically observe this policy
(p. 471). Airplane manufacturers were advised
that sale of planes to the Spanish Government
would violate the spirit of this neutrality policy
and for the most part they complied, but in De-
cember the Department was obliged to grant li-
censes for such sales as it had no legal authority
to refuse (pp. 474—476; 618—620). The policy of
non-interference was reiterated repeatedly as the
Civil \Var continued. (See pp. 498—499, 519—520,
527, 536-538, 623—624.)
