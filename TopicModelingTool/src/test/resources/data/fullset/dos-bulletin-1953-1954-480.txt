youth leaders. It assisted selected student ad-
visers from American universities in tours of
Middle East countries to survey educational needs
and to renew contacts with returned foreign
students. It facilitated the tour to 10 Near East-
ern countries of a group of American mayors and
private citizens desiring to observe U.S. foreign
aid programs and the work of the United Nations
in rehabilitation and refugee problems.
In the Far Eat
This area is of the greatest importance. The
natural resources of the Far East make it a rich
prize in the eyes of the Communists. Nor is its
strategic importance overlooked. As Lenin once
said, ‘the road to Paris is through Peki .”
Therefore, the anti-American pressure by nﬁie
Communists in the Far East is continuous and
strong.
The personal approach through exchanges
makes it possible for these eople to obtain a true
picture of America. It all)ays suspicion and in-
spires cooperation.
The 774 exchanges carried out in the Far East
include those with the new nations of Indochina,
Malaya, and Indonesia. The programs emphasize
our des1re to share our achievements rather than
to impose our way of life.
In one country the exchange program concen-
trated on bringing over ofﬁcials from one of the
more important ministries, not only because of
their far-reaching inﬂuence at both national and
local government levels, but as directors of gov-
ernment publications, motion pictures, radio, and
other information activities.
From the Philippines came a oup of youth
leaders, who toured the United States learning
about American youth activities and the role they
play in our national life. A group of labor leaders
came from Japan to study the labor movement in
the United States, ﬁrst by participating in a spe-
cially arranged seminar at an American univer-
sity and later by working directly with union
locals.
Individual exchanges included specialists such
as the Public Health doctor from Ceylon con-
cerned with the control of certain tropical dis-
eases, now receiving specialized training at the
U.S. Public Health Service; a member of Parlia-
ment and chairman of a ﬁnance committee in
Burma; an editor and publisher from Thailand;
and important government ofﬁcials from critical
Indochina.
Plans were also made for a two-way “Repre-
sentative Government Project” in Japan, under
which groups of Japanese students will pursue
special programs in this ﬁeld at American uni-
versities, and a seminar will be held in Japan by
prominent American lecturers and specialists.
Five hundred Japanese educators and government
ofﬁcials at both the national, prefectural, and mu-
nicipal levels will participate in this seminar.
A special exchange project was planned for
Korea under which a past president of the Amer-
ican Bar Association and a dean of a law school
in a large southwestern university will conduct
a legal institute for Korean judges, prosecutors,
and lawyers.
Among the 104 Americans to visit this area was
Anna Lord Straus, a former United Nations dele-
gate, who is inﬁuential among Far Eastern wom-
en’s groups, speakin on the sub'cct of each in-
dividual’s responsibi ity for goo local and na-
tional government.
Other visitors included a labor leader and a pio-
neer in the development of the television industry
who, together, discussed good labor-management
relations and industrial research under the free
enterprise system.
Among the particularly eﬁ'ective tours of pri-
vate rou s to this area was the visit to Japan of
the ew ork Giants. The Department cooper-
ated with American baseball ofﬁcials in coordinat-
ing the tour, arrangin through Foreign Service
posts for advance pub icity and other assistance.
The Japanese are avid baseball fans and re-
sponded in large numbers to see the Giants in
action against a Japanese team. Perhaps the most
signiﬁcant tribute to the Giants and their per-
formance in Japan was the total absence of any
Communist propaganda or unfavorable comment.
The presence on the team of some Negro players
was noted as an indication of racial equality.
Widely and favorably reported was the message
of President Eisenhower which Baseball Com-
missioner Ford Frick brought with him.
Altogether, the Department assisted 50 groups
in exchanging 111 persons with the Far East
during this period.
The Department also administers a program of
emergency aid to Chinese and Korean students and
scholars stranded in the United States. As self-
support became impossible for the majority of
these persons, grants were awarded to enable them
to reach their educational objectives in this coun-
try. Carried out under authority of Public Law
535, 81st Congress, this rogram reached its ak
durin the 1950—51 aca emic year. It has en
declining steadily since that time. Regulations
promulgated by the Attorney General in 1951
under Public Law 535 enabled these grantees to
seek employment in the United States. The De-
partment has since encouraged private groups and
individuals to employ Chinese grantees aided
under the program until it becomes practicable for
them to return to their home country. During the
last 6 months, 182 Chinese students and scholars
were assisted as compared with 2,400 during the
1950—51 academic year.
The China Aid Act was amended in 1951 to
provide Korean students with similar beneﬁts,
with the exception that Koreans may not remain
