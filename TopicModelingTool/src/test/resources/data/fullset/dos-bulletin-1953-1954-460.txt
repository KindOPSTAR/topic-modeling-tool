power of the General Assembly is established by
the charter and that the Assembly cannot divest
itself of responsibility for its exercise. Not only
has the General Assembly the right to consider and
ap rove or disapprove a budget item, it has no
r115“; to avoid the conscientious discharge of this
responsibility.
With regard to the second question, the state-
ment points out a variety of reasons why the Gen-
eral Assembl might decide to refuse to give effect
to awards 0 the Tribunal. They are:
Mistaken reliance by the Tribunal upon false
re resentations of a arty in a case;
nter retation and) application of regulations
establis ed by the General Assembly with effect
contrary to the express or reiterated intent and
object of the General Assembly, such as: awards
made in ﬂa nt disregard of the statute or rules,
to the prejudice of either party; ultra 'vires
awards; decisions premised on serious miscon-
struction of the charter, articularly in regard to
the powers and res onsilbilities of the principal
organs, such as: decision invading charter powers
or discretion of the Secretary-General, or decision
violative of article 101 (3) of the charter;
Decision contrary to an advisory opinion of the
International Court of Justice;
Awards arbitrary or unreasonable on their face;
Important and inconsistent decisions giving rise
to serious uncertainties in the administration of
the Secretariat;
Awards entailing impossible ﬁnancial conse-
3uences for the Organization. Needless to say,
uress exercised upon the Tribunal, corru tion of
the Tribunal, or action evidencing preju( ice and
improper motives of an of its members would call
for similar action t e General Assembly.
It concludes that ‘the answer to Question (2) is
that, as a matter of law, the General Assembly
must rely upon policy grounds in refusing to give
effect to awards of the Tribunal, acting with due
regard for relevant Charter provisions, such as the
express stipulation of a ‘paramount consideration’
in Article 101.”
The United States must await an opportunity
to examine the statements admitted by other gov-
ernments before deciding upon its next step in the
present proceedings.
