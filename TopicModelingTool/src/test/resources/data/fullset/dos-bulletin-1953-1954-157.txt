Visit of Turkish President
Press Conference Statement by Secretary Dulles
Press release 23 dated January 19
We here in Washington look forward very
eagerly to the visit of the President of Turkey.1
It is a matter of great personal regret to me that
I shall not be present to join in the reception of
him. I had planned a dinner in his honor, which
will be held in my place by the Acting Secretary
of State.
Turkey is an ally which has shown its worth in
many respects. It has shown its understanding
of the problems of our times to a remarkable de-
gree, and I am conﬁdent that the American people
will all want to express their recognition to the
President of Turkey, who stands for a people
whom we respect and admire and whom we count
upon as ﬁrm allies.

J ANUARY 19, 1954
DEAR Mn. Amaassanoa: Before I leave for Ber-
lin to attend the Foreign Ministers Conference, I
should like you to know how much I regret the
fact that I will not be here to welcome the Presi-
dent of your country when he comes to Washing-
ton next week. I had been looking forward to
receiving him, and it is a great disappointment
to me that this will not be possible.
Please express to President Bayar my best
wishes for an enjoyable visit during his stay in
the United States.
Sincerely yours,
JOHN Fos'rna Dumas
His Excellency
FERIDUN C. ERKIN,
Ambassador of Turkey.

The interest of your group in international re-
lations is a clear indication that you are among
the many, many Americans who know that our
position of leadershi in the world today places
very hea responsi ilities upon us as citizens.
You also now that we can discharge these re-
sponsibilities only b getting to know the people
and the problems 0 other countries and getting
them to know and understand us. Obviously, that
is a big order, and we must use every means at
our disposal to try to bring this better understand-
ing about.
One reason why I am glad to talk about the
work of the International Educational Exchange
Program of the State Department is that it rep-

standing. I think that the direct person-to-per-

si i cant contribution to our mutual goals.
be ieve that the average American has enough
faith in our democratic system to realize that, if
the people of other countries have a chance to
see us as we are, in our daily life and in our jobs,
they will become reliable inte reters of this coun-
try to their fellow citizens. n this way we can
build up a climate of public opinion overseas in
which our actions, our motives, and our policies
can be correctly interpreted.
