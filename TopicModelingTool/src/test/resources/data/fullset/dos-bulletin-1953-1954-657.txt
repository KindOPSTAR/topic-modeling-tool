members as evidenced by an examination of the
minutes of the 89th and 96th meetings of the
NNSC, conformed to and appeared to be unduly
inﬂuenced by the contents of two rior letters of
19 January and 27 January, issue by the Senior
Member of the KPA and CPV, MAC, as his reply
to the UNC unilateral requests submitted to the
NNSC on 18 January and 26 January, respec-
tively. Substantiation of such inﬂuence is found
in the following remark made by the Polish mem-
ber and conﬁrmed by the Czech member, at the
96th meeting of the N N SC:
The Polish Delegation also deems it its duty to declare
that for the above stated reasons it will not agree~—either
now or in the future—to a request of one of the sides to
conduct any investigation in connection with the issue of
retention of the captured personnel of the other side—
untii settlement or understanding is reached on the matter
by the two opposing sides or by the forthcoming political
conference.
Such a decision by the Czech and Polish members
is considered b the UNC to render the NNSC
ineffective for uture investigation of an Armi-
stice violations relating to captured RO A per-
sonnel impressed into KPA and CPV military
units.
5. Finally, on 9 February, 1954, the UNC uni-
laterally requested the NNSC to investigate the
illegal 1ntroduction of combat material 1nto the
territory under the military control of the KPA
and the CPV, in violation of the Armistice Agree-
ment. Names of places and exact locations were
included in this re uest of the UN C. Before the
NNSC had oﬁicial y announced its decision re-
garding the UNC re uest, the Senior Member of
the KPA and CPV, AC, addressed a letter to
the Senior Member of the UNC, MAC, denying
all the facts presented. Concurrently he for-
warded an almost identical letter to the NNSC.
The 1nﬂuence that this letter had on the proceed-
ings of the NN SC cannot be discounted.
.6. In attempting to veil these KPA and CPV
violations, the Senior Member of the KPA and
CPV, MAC, charged the UNC with violations of
the Armistice Agreement, with no foundation in
fact. In addition to labeling the UNC charges
slanderous fabrication, the Senior Member of the
KPA and CPV, MAC, attempted to offset the
UNC requests for investigation of violations by
submitting unfounded charges against the UNC.
In a letter dated 23 Feb. 1954, the NN SC indicated
its inability to carry out its pledged obligations
wrth regard to the UNC requests of 9 February
1954. This letter was received on 19 March 1954.
This was the ﬁfth time that the Czech and Polish
members of the NN SC refused to participate in
the performance of their duties as members of the
NNSC, in accordance with the provisions of the
Armistice Agreement.
7. Reliable information available to the UNC
shows that the KPA and CPV have introduced
operating combat aircraft into the territory under
the military control of the KPA and the CPV, and
are introducing combat equipment in such a man-
ner as to by-pass and evade the NNITs [Neutral
Nations Inspection Teams] at the ports of entry
in the territor under the military control of the
KPA and the ‘PV, all of which acts are deliberate
violations of the Armistice A reement. Although
the Senior Member of the NC, MAC, has re-
quested that investigation of these violations be
accomplished by the N NSC, the Senior Member of
the KPA and CPV, MAC, has stated that no such
ins ection could ever be permitted since the KPA
an CPV have not violated the agreement. The
Senior Member of the KPA and CPV, MAC, as
the representative of his commanders, has clearly
violated that ortion of para 17 of the Armistice
Agreement w ich states:
The Commanders of the opposing sides shall establish
within their respective commands all measures and pro-
cedures necessary to insure complete compliance with all
of the provisions hereof by all elements of their commands.
They shall actively cooperate with one another and with
the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Na-
tions Supervisory Commission in requiring observance of
both the letter and the spirit of all of the provisions of
this Armistice Agreement.
8. The UNC has made every effort to facilitate
the operations of the NNSC in the territory under
the military control of the UNC and has in good
faith complied with the letter and spirit of the
Armistice Agreement. The NNITs have been
given maximum freedom to inspect incoming and
outgoing equipment according to the a eement.
The N NITs have been given access to ocuments
listing combat materiel and military personnel in-
troduced into and evacuated from the territory
under the military control of the UNC. With the
aid of these documents they have been able to
accomplish their supervisory duties quickly and
eﬂiciently. At airﬁelds the teams received infor-
mation on all arrivals and departures of aircraft
including approximate ﬂight ap ointment times,
type of aircraft, and ﬂight num ers. The teams
have been allowed to board cargo aircraft to ac-
complish their inspections and inspections have
been carried out dai y. The UNC has always will-
ingly and freely com lied with requests of the
NNITs for additionai) information. The UNC,
in its desire to carry out both the spirit and letter
of the Armistice Agreement, has allowed the above
mentioned freedom to the NNITs in spite of the
fact that it has been obvious from the ﬁrst that
the Polish and Czech members of the NNITs have
been utilizing this ver freedom for the purpose
of takin advantage of, administrative errors and
technica discrepancies to charge the UN C with
deliberate efforts to violate the Armistice Agree-
ment. If the UNC had intended to violate the
Armistice Agreement it would have followed the
system used in the territory under the military
control of the KPA and CPV. In that territory
the NNITs have been so restricted and handi-
capped by the established procedures that they
