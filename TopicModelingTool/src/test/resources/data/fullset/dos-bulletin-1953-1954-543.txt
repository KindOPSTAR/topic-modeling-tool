ferred to the “complete good will of Egypt” and
“its efforts to prepare the ground for a reasonable
solution.” He also, quite properly, called for simi-
lar efforts by the Government of Israel. We could
not fail to endorse such sentiments. We are con-
vinced that they can be iven effect by acceptance
and realﬁrmation of the ouncil’s decision of Sep-
tember 1, 1951. We hold similar views with re-
s ect to the various other decisions of the United
ations on this difﬁcult uestion of Palestine. We
hope that these views wi 1 continue to be the views
of all responsible members, whether charged with
the peculiar responsibility of membership in this
Council or otherwise. In this spirit we will vote
for the draft resolution proposed by the delegation
of New Zealand.°


'I'l'li CONGRESS



Legal Basis for Agreements
With Japan
On M arch 15 Sen. H. Alexander Smith, of New
Jersey, addressed to the Secretary 0 State a com-
munication regarding the Mutual efense Assist-
ance Agreement and related agreements recently
signed at T oleyo.‘ Senator Smith raised the ques-
tion of whether or not executive agreements of this
nature require an action by the Congress, in addi-
tion to the legis ration already in existence, and
especially whether these undertakings slwuld be
considered as treaties needing the ad vice and con-
sent of the Senate. Following is the text of a re-
ply to Senator Smith from Thruston B. Morton,
Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relations: 5
MARCH 23, 1954.
MY DEAR SENATOR SMITH: The Secretary has
asked me to reply to your letter of March 15, 1954,
which raises the uestion whether the Mutual De-
fense Assistance eement and other agreements
signed with J a an on March 8 should be submitted
to the Senate or its advice and consent. You are,
of course, correct in your assum tion that these
agreements may be concluded wit out the advice
and consent of the Senate because they are author-
ized by the mutual security le islation, but I am
glad to have the question raise so that we may be
gure that we have resolved any doubts you may
ave.
I should ﬁrst like to point out that these agree-
ments are substantially similar in form and con-
tent to many others which have been negotiated
over the past few years in connection with the
mutual security program, and that they conform
in all essential respects to standard patterns with
which the Congress is familiar. In accordance
with procedures which were established in May
1953, these agreements, like all other international
agreements which have been negotiated since that
time, were carefully checked in advance b the
staff of Mr. Herman Phleger, the Legal A viser
‘ For text see Burma-rm of Apr. 5, 1954, p. 518.
‘Reprlnted from Cong. Rec. of Mar. 29, p. 3698.
of this Department, to insure that it was proper
to conclude them without the advice and consent
of the Senate. Under these procedures, no nego-
tiations of executive agreements are undertaken
without prior authorization in writin by the
Secretary or the Under Secretary, and t e agree-
ments to which you refer were so approved on the
basis of the clear statutory authorization contained
in the mutual security legislation.
The principal agreement, dealing with the mu-
tual defense assistance program, is required and
authorized by section 402 of the Mutual Defense
Assistance Act of 1949, as amended, which pro-
vides that “The President shall, prior to the fur—
nishing of assistance to any eligible nation, con-
clude agreements with such nation,” and prescribes
certain of the terms which must be included in a
mutual defense assistance agreement.
The mutual defense assistance agreements con-
cluded pursuant to this section do not in them-
selves determine the nature and the level of the
military assistance to be given the foreign coun-
try, but merel set forth certain terms and condi-
tions on whic any such assistance will be pro-
vided. Article I of the agreement with Japan
states that “Each Government "‘ "' * will make
available to the other * "‘ * such equi ment, ma-
terials, services, or other assistance as t e Govern-
ment furnishing such assistance may authorize”
and provides that any assistance furnished by the
United States will be furnished under the terms,
conditions, and termination provisions of the au-
thorizing legislation and appropriation acts deal-
ing with the mutual security program. Since it
is necessary each ear to secure from Congress
authority and fun s to conduct the mutual secu-
rity program for the following year, Congress will
have the opportunity to review, on an annual basis,
the military assistance which is planned for Japan.
Thus, in presenting the mutua security program
to Congress last year, it was indicated that we
intended to give military assistance to Japan un-
der that program upon the conclusion of the re-
quired agreement, and this year’s presentation will
give Congress an opportunity to consider again
the plans for military assistance to Japan. These
plans are directed exclusively toward increasing
the capability of Japan to defend itself against
internal subversion and external attack, with a
'The vote on Mar. 29 was 8—2 (U.S.S.R, Lebanon),
with China abstaining; it was the U.S.S.R.'s 58th veto.
