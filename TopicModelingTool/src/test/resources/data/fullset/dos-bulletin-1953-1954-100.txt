into economic impotence. Further, Israel takes
the position that their neighboring Arab States
intentionally permit the continuance of these de-
plorable refugee conditions on the borders of
Israel for the urpose of keeping alive the ten-
sions between t em and Israe , and for the ur-
pose of mobilizing public opinion in behalf 0 the
Arab position.
Finally, they point to the fact that it is Israel
which has invoked the provision of the Armistice
Agreement for a settlement of all points of dispute
leading to a ﬁnal settlement with the Arab States,
but it is the Arab States which refuse to negotiate
a peace settlement.
(3) The Refugees. The attitude of the refugees
themselves is more difficult to assess, because there
is no single authoritative voice to speak for them.
However, representatives of several non-govern-
mental agencies assisting the refugees refer to
their state of mind as wanting to be re atriated to
their homes in Israel. This matter, owever, is
subject to some division of informed opinion to the
effect that the refugees would be reluctant to re-
turn to their homes under Israeli rule. It is con-
tended that laws of the State of Israel are punitive
and discriminatory to the Arabs who remain in
Israel, and would be worse if large numbers of
them were repatriated. However, it is claimed
that the refugees demand the recognition of the
principle of their right to repatriation, or, in the
alternative, to be compensated for their property
now in Israel.
['11 2' ted Nations Action
The general attitude and position of the Arabs
and Israelis outlined above has seriously impeded
any effective work on the part of the Palestine
Conciliation Commission in bringing the parties
together to resolve the outstanding questions be-
tween them. As a result of this failure, the Pa]-
estine Conciliation Commission for the ast two
years has been conﬁned primarily to stu ying the
compensation problem and making arrangements
for unfreezing of blocked accounts of Arabs in
banks located in Israel. Meanwhile, an uneasy
state of armistice exists under the terms of the
separate armistice a eements between Israel and
each of her surrounding Arab neighbors. The ob-
servation and enforcement of these agreements
is entrusted to the Chief of Staff of the United
Nations Truce Supervision Organization, backed
up by the Security Council.
IX. Obsorvatlons
This report is of necessity not a complete state-
ment because the Commission has not as yet had
an opportunity to inspect the area. The Com-
mission feels, however, that the following observa-
tions, although general in nature, are fundamental
and deserve immediate and further exploration.
It is hoped that more concrete recommendations
can be made by the Commission following its in-
vestigation in the area.
The refugee problem is inextricably woven into
the entire economic, social, and political situation
which afflicts the Middle East of today.
Economic development of the area, without
doubt, will make the possibilities of peace more
capable of realization. However, it is not in itself
a complete answer to the problem. The Commis-
sion sees no permanent solution to the refugee
problem until there is a more favorable political
atmosphere leading to a workable peace estab-
lished between the Arab States and Israel.
The depth of the emotions and the character
of the issues involved on both sides are not such
as to lend themselves to a permanent solution
of the refugee problem by economic considerations
alone.
This government has both a stake and responsi-
bility, together with the other members of the
United Nations, in the ﬁnal solution of the refugee
problem. Arabs and Israelis, for different rea-
sons, recognize our concern in the prosperity and
stability of the Near East. Therefore, the Com-
mission makes the following observations:
(1) Support should be given to the decision of
the United Nations General Assembly to continue
the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for
Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) until June 30, 1955.
It should be noted that the U. S. Delegation to the
United Nations voted in favor of this resolution.
(2) Temporary and stop- ap projects are not
the solution to the economic istress of the people
in this area. It follows that only a permanent
and practical plan of development is the answer
to the economic side of the refugee problem. The
principles of the uniﬁed plan for the development
of the Jordan River appear to be the best forward
ste in this direction, inasmuch as water appears
to e the most valued resource in this area, and in
shortest supply. The Commission feels that this
will overcome the inertia enveloping the refugee
problem and give that necessary impetus which
would put the refugees in a osition to help them-
selves and become indepen ent of the largess of
others.
(3) Despite the difficult situation as related to
the refugees, there appear to be favorable oppor-
tunities for permanent economic improvement of
refugee families. This involves the development
of irrigation projects and appurtenant works
which, if developed, could improve the economic
condition of a substantial part of this area. The
surveys now in progress should be pursued to com-
pletion as soon as possible to determine if the
projects are feasible and economically sound, in
order that agreements can be reached at an early
date to clear the way for commencement of
construction.
(4) All available resources, both private and
public, must be used to restore that sense of mutual
