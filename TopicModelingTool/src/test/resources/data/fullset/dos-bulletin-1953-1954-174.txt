of hostilities in Korea showed that the United
Nations Charter did not constitute an absolute
guaranty against armed aggression. e free na-
tions realized their insecurity if they remained dis-
armed and disunited in the face of a powerful
military bloc combining the resources of 800 mil-
lion people.
Mr. Molotov, in his address, cited the principle
that action provokes reaction. That is true, as we
see; but not with the application which Mr. Molo-
tov gave it.
Another disheartening aspect of the Soviet F or-
eign Minister’s statement was its reiteration of the
importance of accepting the Chinese Communist
regime as one of the so-called “ﬁve great powers”
which have worldwide responsibility for the es-
tablishment of peace.
U. S. View: on Communlet Chlne
This offspring of Soviet communism committed
ﬂagrant aggression in Korea, for which it was
formally condemned by the United Nations. It
is actively promoti a gression against Viet-
.\'am Laos, and Cam ia. All of the nations
which are the neighbors of this Chinese Commu-
nist regime feel menaced by its scarcely concealed
a snve urpose.
thoug 6 months have gone by since it agreed
to hold a political conference with relation to
Korea, Communist China has constantly found
excuses and placed obstructions in the way.
This convicted aggressor is the nation which
the Soviet Union chooses to be its companion in
its quest for peace and which it demands should
be accepted by the United States and others. I
would like to state here lainly and unequivocally
what the Soviet Forei giﬁnister already knows-—
the United States wil not agree to join in a ﬁve-
power conference with the Chinese Communist
aggressors for the purpose of dealing generally
with the cc of the world.
The nited States refuses not because, as is
su d, it denies that the regime exists, or that
it as power. We in the United States well know
that it exists and has power, because its aggres-
sive armies joined with the North Korean aggra-
sors to kill and wound 150,000 Americans who
went to Korea in company with British, French,
and other United Nations forces to resist that ag-
ssion in res onse to the appeal of the United
ations. We 0 not refuse to deal with it where
occasion requires. “'0 did deal with it in making
the Korean armistice. lVe deal with it today at
Panmunjom in our effort to bring about a Korean
peace conference. It is, however, one thing to
recognize evil as a fact. It is another thing to
take evil to one’s breast and call it good.
Moreover, the United States rejects the Soviet
concept that any so-called “ﬁve at powers”
have a right to rule the world an to determine
the destinies of other nations. The United Na-
tions Charter confers no such mandate. Nor is
any such mandate to be found in rinciples of
justice and fair dealing. Undougtedly great
power carries with it a great responsibility for
promoting and protecting peace but such power
givas no right to dictate to smaller owns or to
manage the affairs of the world. I e believe in
the principle, embodied in the Charter of the
United Nations, that there is a sovereign equality
of all states, great and small.
Despite the discouragement which must be the
ﬁrst reaction to the Soviet Minister's speech, I
propose that we refuse to be discouraged and get
ahead with our business. We hope that there will
be a genuine opportunity for us to explore to-
gether new ideas such as have been put forward
in the addresses of the Forei Ministers of France
and of Great Britain. In t is respect, Mr. Eden
has made a Series of concrete proposals regarding
German which deserve our serious consideration.
Mr. L olotov has proposed an agenda. It is not
the a nda that we would pro , but it is an
agen a which we will take for t e sake of getting
on with our work. We do not want to turn this
conference into another Palais Rose conference
where our deputies met for many weeks in futile
argument about the agenda.2 The Soviet Foreign
Minister has proposed a ﬁrst agenda item which
includes the convenin of a meeting of Ministers
of Foreign Affairs of rance, Britain, the United
States, the Soviet Union, and the Chinese People’s
Republic. The United States is willing to deal
with, and dis se of, this agenda item.
Then woul come the German question and the
problem of insuring Euro n security. German
is a matter which primarily concerns us here, an
the sooner we can get to it, the better.
Then the Soviet Union proposed discussion of
the Austrian state treaty. Since the treaty was
alread substantially concluded 5 years a o, and
since t 1e Soviet Union has already receive much
more than the re aration which it ori 'nally de-
manded, this r0 lem should be quicklgyl disposed
of. We won (1 have preferred to deal with it
earlier. But if the Soviet Union refers to leave
to the last what is the easiest to 0, then we will
accommodate ourselves to their wishes in this
res ect.
he important thing is that we quickly show
a capacity to discharge our responsibi ities toward
others and not to waste our time in recriminations
as amongst ourselves.
I have said that power carries with it a great
responsibility toda ' ; as the four occupying powers
in Germany and ustria, we possess a responsi-
bility for which, unless it be well discharged, the
verdict of history will ﬁnd us guilty.
' Deputies of the Foreign Ministers held 73 meetings at
the Palais Rose in Paris from March through June 1951
in an effort to agree on an agenda for a meeting of the
Foreign Ministers. For reports on the sessions, see BUL-
