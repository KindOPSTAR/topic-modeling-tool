such a system should be designed and grow from

The Development of United States Pollcy In the Near East,
South Asla, and Africa During 1953:
by H arry N. Howard
The Problems of Palestlne
The United States was faced with a. number of
problems from Palestine during the course of
1953, problems which had been well characterized
by Secretary Dulles in his address of June 1,
following his visit to the Middle East. In general,
four speciﬁc problems arose, some of them of long
standing: (1) the problem of Jerusalem; (2 the
Arab refugees; (3) the Qibi a incident; an (4)
the dispute over the Israel hydroelectric project
in the Israel-Syrian Demilitarized Zone.
\Vith regard to the oblem of Jerusalem, Secre-
tary Dulles stated on une 1 : 3‘
Jerusalem is divided into armed camps split between
Israel and the Arab nation of Jordan. The atmosphere
is heavy with hate. As I gazed on the Mount 0! Olives,
I felt anew that Jerusalem is, above all, the holy place
of the Christian, Moslem, and Jewish faiths. This has
been repeatedly emphasized by the United Nations. This
does not necessarily exclude some political status in Jeru-
salem for Israel and Jordan. But the world religious
community has claims in Jerusalem which take prece-
dence over the political claims of any particular nation.

Part II
Nevertheless, on July 10 the Israel Government
announced that the Foreign Ministry, as long
planned, was henceforth to be in Jerusalem rather
than Tel Aviv, despite the resolutions of the Gen-
eral Assembly of November 29, 1947. December
11, 1948, and December 9, 1949.32 The original
intent to move the capital to Jerusalem had been
announced as early as February 1, 1949. In spite
of a request for explanations by the Palestine Con-
ciliation Commission on September 20, 1949 and a
protest by the Trusteeship Council on December
20, 1949, government oﬂices had been moved piece-
meal to that city. Reiterating the position which
it had announced on July 9, 1952, the Department
of State declared on July 11, 1953 : “a
The Department was informed on July 10 by the Israeli
Government that it intends to transfer its Foreign Min-
istry from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem as of July 12, 1953.
The United States does not plan to transfer it Embassy
from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. It is felt that this would
be inconsistent with the UN. resolutions dealing with the
international nature of Jerusalem and that it would not
observe the solution regarding Jerusalem which was set
forth in the Secretary of State's address of June 1, 1953.
” See UN. Resolutions 181 (II), 194 (III), 303 (IV).
