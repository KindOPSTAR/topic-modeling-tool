Foreign Relations Volume
Press release 305 dated June 7
The growing threat of a general European War
and the Civil War in Spain form the subject
matter of the greater part of the documentation
printed in Foreign. Relations of the United States,
1937, Volume I, General, which the Department
of State released on June 12. As in the volumes
for earlier years, the United States appears in a
role of neutrality and nonintervention, but indi-
cation of a oselble shift of policy appears with
President Igoosevelt’s “quarantine speech” at
Chicago on October 5.
Technically there was no war in Europe in
1937, even the ﬁghting in Spain not being reco -
nized as such, but, as Franqois-Poncet, Frenc
Ambassador to Germany, remarked to Ambassa-
dor William C. Bullitt at Paris, “nations no
longer waged war; they waged peace.” (p. 123)
From Warsaw, Ambassador John Cudahy
wrote to President Roosevelt on December 26, 1936,
that there was a ersistent rumor that the Presi-
dent contemplate some sort of movement in fur-
therance of eace in Europe. He described the
future outloo as dismal but believed it would be
a grave mistake for the President to attempt any
mediation without ﬁrst having a deﬁnite program
for im roving conditions in Germany (pp. 24—26).
In rep y, President Roosevelt wrote on January
15, 1937: “Do not believe rumors that I contem-
plate any move of any kind in Europe—certainly
under conditions of the moment.” (pp. 26—27)
In a telegram of April 10 from London, Nor-
man Davis, Chairman of the American delegation
to the General Disarmament Conference, re-
ported a conversation with the British Secretary
of State for Foreign Affairs, Anthony Eden.
The latter said that when the time came to make
a move for eace it would robably be best for
the United tates to take tlie lead. Mr. Davis
told him that, despite concern for the inevitable
disaster that would come unless something was
done to reverse suicidal policies, he was sure the
President had no desire or intention of interject-
ing himself in the European political situation.
In two telegrams of April 30, Ambassador Bul-
litt recorded conversations with Sir Eric Phipps,
British Ambassador to France, and Yvon Delbos,
French Foreign Minister, in which the theme was
that a strong stand against Germany by France
and England backed by the benevolent neutrality
of the United States might preserve peace in Eu-
rope. They expressed themselves extremely satis-
ﬁed with American neutrality legislation. (pp.
84—86) This favorable view of the neutrality
law was not shared by Neville Chamberlain, Brit-
ish Chancellor of the Exchequer, who in a memo-
randum of about March 30 to Henry Morgenthau,
Secretary of the Treasury, characterized the exist-
ing law as an indirect but potent encouragement
to aggression and declared its amendment would
be the greatest single contribution which the
United States could make to world eace. (pp.
98—102, 100) In a reply to the British Embassy
on June 1, the Department of State explained cer-
tain changes in neutrality legislation and empha-
sized the need for liberal economic policies to ease
political tension. (pp. 102—106)
In July, after Mr. Chamberlain became Prime
Minister, a meeting between him and President
Roosevelt was proposed but on September 28
the former wrote that the time was not ripe.
(p .113,121-122)
On August 31, Ambassador William Phillips at
Rome was informed that the Italian Government
would welcome the initiative of President Roose-
velt to assure European peace and would do every-
thing in its power to lend its support. (p. 121)
President Roosevelt’s “quarantine” s eech of
October 5 is not reprinted in this volume ut there
are a number of diplomatic reports on reactions to
it. (pp. 132-139, 151-152, 154, 210, 413, 425, 450,
464) The speech aroused hope in some quarters
of more actlve interest by the United States in
European affairs but it was followed by no deﬁnite
further moves. Under Secretary of State Sum-
ner Welles oﬂ'ered a proposal for concerted inter-
national action to reach common agreement on
the principles of international conduct to preserve
peace but the plan to resent it to foreign govern—
ments was abandone . (pp. 665—670)
Assistant Secreta George S. Messersmith on
October 11 presente to the Secretary of State a.
signiﬁcant memorandum on the threat to peace
from aggressive dictatorships if dangerous com-
promises continued to be made. ( p. 140—145)
He declared that “there is no escape fi'om the con-
clusion that the United States are the ultimate
object of attack of the powers grouped in this new
system of force and lawlessness.” (p. 141)
In a dispatch of November 23, Ambassador Bul-
litt reported a series of conversations on a trip to
lVarsaw and Berlin. (pp. 162—177) Most sig-
niﬁcant, perhaps, was that with Hermann Goering.
(pp. 170—177) This Nazi leader frankly stated
that Germany was determined to annex Austria
and that the Sudeten Germans of Czechoslovakia
as well as all other Germans living contiguous to
Germany must enter the German Reich.
The sections on the Spanish Civil War in this
volume contain numerous reports which indicate
the Department of State was carefully watching
developments but, as in the previous year (see
Foreign Relations, 1936, Volume II), the U.S.
Government maintained a policy of strict nonin-
tervention and centered its activities on the
protection of American lives and property and
on preventing the sending of American war ma-
terial to the belligerents.
