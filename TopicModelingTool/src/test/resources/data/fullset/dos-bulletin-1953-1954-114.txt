The Growing Structure of International Motor Traffic Agreements
by H11. Kelly and W. G. Eliot, 3d
In the expanding ﬁeld of international travel,
there is rising a structure of formal agreements
among nations which is rapidly makin it easier
for motorists to travel in forei n countries. And
motoring, of course, is one o the best ways to
travel.
These agreements are designed to open wide the
highways of the free. world to bona ﬁde tourists
in automobiles, b such essential means as recipro-
cal recognition 0 drivers’ licenses and registration
plates, standard rules for safe driving, minimum
equipment uirements, uniform roa si s, and
facilitationrg? passage through customs. ventu-
ally they should make it almost as easy for a U. S.
motorist to drive a car in Europe or other parts of
the world as to take a long trip 1n his own country.
At the base of the structure of international
a ments is the Convention on Road Traﬁc.‘
is treaty was drawn up at a United Nations
conference at Geneva in 1949, came into force in
1952, and has been ratiﬁed to date by the follow-
ing: United States, France, Czechoslovakia,’
Monaco, Sweden, Greece, Union of South Africa,
Philippines, Netherlands, Cuba, Luxembourg,
Italy, the Vatican City, and Syria. Further rati-
ﬁcation by most of the countries of the world
appears to be on] a (Siestion of time, and the
treaty is already ooke upon as the key instru-
ment in the ﬁeld of international motor traﬁic.
The Geneva Conference in 1949 recognized that
there were certain speciﬁc problems which would
require further study and elaboration, among
them: 1) the deﬁnition of proper qualiﬁcations of
drivers, 2) the posible development of a truly
worldwide code of road signs and signals, and 3)

and Motor Transport," see Bmwrm of Dec. 12, 1949,

' Czechoslovakia, which ratiﬁed the convention in 1950,
is the only member of the Soviet bloc to have taken such
action. It is not anticipated that any motorists from that
country will make application for travel in the United
States or that any United States motorists will desire to
travel in Czechoslovakia under existing conditions. Pass~
port and visa controls are not aﬂected by the Convention
on Road Traﬂic.
the spelling out of provisions for facilitating clear-
ance of tourist automobiles through customs.
Much work has been done on all of these under the
aegis of the United Nations, and the member gov-
ernments are now considering pro osals for formal
agreements in these ﬁelds. The . S. Government,
with the active assistance of State officials and
motorin associations among other interested
groups, as played an active part in the three proj-
ects mentioned above.
Qualiﬁcations of Drivers
The 1949 Convention on Road Trafﬁc provides
for the international recognition of driving li-
censes issued by any Contracting State to persons
over 18 years of age who have given proof of their
competence to drive. It does not, however, deﬁne
“proof of competence.” In view of the known wide
differences in licensin requirements, the United
Nations in 1952 nam a small international com-
mittee of experts, representing the six principal
regions of the world, to study the matter and to
recommend uniform international standards, with
particular reference to “proof of competence.”
This committee, which elected as its chairman
Rudolph F. Kin , Re 'strar of Motor Vehicles for
the Commonwea th 0 Massachusetts, submitted a
lengthy report which was acce ted by the United
Nations Economic and Social ouncil on April 15,
1953. The Council’s resolution on this subject pro-
posed an amendment to annex 8 of the 1949 con-
vention to provide that the requirement of “proof
of competence” shall have been met if the driver’s
permit was issued after a satisfactory examination
of his ability to drive safely. his knowledge of traf-
ﬁc laws and regulations, and his physical and men-
tal ﬁtness. The details of this examination are left
to the discretion of the individual nation. but help-
ful recommendations are contained in the full re-
port of the committee of experts. Other provisions
of the amendment deal with permits antedating the
convention of 1949, learners permits, and permits
issued to disabled persons.
