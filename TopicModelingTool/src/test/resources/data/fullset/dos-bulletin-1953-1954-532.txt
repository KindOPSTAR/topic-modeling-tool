While Europe is no longer a pushover, neither is
it a solid bulwark against aggression. The ground
strength of the NATO forces is still great] in-
ferior to that of the Soviet Union and its sate lites.
NATO weaknesses in the air are even more pro-
nounced. General Gruenther has stated ﬂatly that
the present Naro forces cannot be ex ected to de-
feat an all-out Soviet attack against urope.
The continued buildup of NATO defenses is
largely an economic pro lem. \Ve know that a
de ense program is worthless unless it rests on a
sound economic base, and we also know that the
defense rograms of most of our allies have closely
approac ied the limits of their present economic
capabilities. A serious economic setback in Europe
would not only wreck the NATO defense system
but would also undermine the entire fabric of
European society and risk Communist political
victories in one or more countries.
This economic limitation of the defense program
becomes especially signiﬁcant when we recognize
the necessity, so clearly pointed out by Secretary
Dulles, that the NATO countries must gear their
defense plans to a “lon pull.” It is im ossible for
us to predict a date w en the Soviet nion may
decide to launch a military attack. It is equally
impossible for us to foresee a date when the Krem-
lin might choose to enter into peaceful cooperation
with its neighbors. Under these circumstances,
it is possible that we may face a long test of endur-
ance—a long period of years in which we may be
required to build and maintain strong military
de enses while at the same time preservin and
strengthening our political and economic de enses.
In a test of endurance, we cannot put all of our
e gs in one basket. We must keep all elements
0% securit in balance and make certain that our
defense p ans are carefully tailored to economic
realities.
A second major problem arises from the fact
that Europe’s basic economic difﬁculties have not
been resolved. The income of the average citizen
of free Europe is still less than one-third the aver-
age income of the American citizen. He also pays
about the same ercentage of his income in taxes
as the average erican. The rise in Euro ean
production has now begun to level off, and t ere
as been no opportunity for any appreciable accu-
mulation of new capital in Europe. Finally, Eu-
rope still needs to 1m ort more than it is able to
export. As a result, urope’s balance of payments
with the outside world continues to be unfavor-
able.
There is no simple solution to Europe’s economic
problems. A solution can be found only by simul-
taneous action along a number of different lines.
Europe needs to ﬁnd wider markets for its goods
and needs to develop freer trade within Europe
itself. The Europeans will also need to continue
a substantial volume of trade in nonstrategic items
with Soviet-dominated areas. They need to
attract private investment from other countries,
especially the United States. They require in-
creased supplies of raw materials from the under-
developed areas. They must learn how to use
their own resources more efﬁciently and to achieve
greater productivity in the use of both capital
and labor.
It may take many years to ﬁnd the answers to
all these problems. Most of the answers must be
found by the Europeans themselves. It is con-
trary to our policy to continue indeﬁnite grants of
economic ass1stance to Europe. At the same time,
the United States cannot simply tell Europe to
“sink or swim” because we ourselves cannot afford
to have Europe sink. For this reason, we are
carefully conmdering economic measures by which
the United States can assist Europe to solve its
roblems. Our national economic policies, includ-
ing tariffs and trade policies, are now under re-
view. Meanwhile, we are helping Europe to
obtain the dollars required to ﬁnance essential
imports by givin European factories an oppor-
tunity to earn do lars through the roduction of
military equipment and supplies in urope.
Representatives of the United States Govern-
ment are convinced that Europe’s success in solv-
ing both its defense problems and its economic
problems will depend argel upon the ability of
the Euro ean nations to ac lieve unity. At the
moment, or example, the most promisin source
of additional defensive strength can be ound in
Western Germany. However, the governments of
Western Europe have indicated that they would
not accept the reestablishment of a German na-
tional army and have insisted that a German mili-
tary contribution be made through a common
European army. This was the origin of the Eco
treaty which I have already mentioned.
Importance of £06
The United States has strongly endorsed the
E00 treaty, not only because 0 the need for a
German defense contribution, but also because it
has many other values. \Ve believe Enc will per-
mit Germany to recover its national independence
under conditions most favorable to the mainte-
nance and growth of democratic institutions. It
will tie Germany ﬁrmly to the \Vest and lay a
groundwork for the gradual eradication of fears
and rivalries between F rance and Germany. It
will also represent a major step on the road to
overall unity in Europe and should pave the way
for further integration in economic and political
activities.
If Enc is not established, the United States has
no choice but to reappraise its basic policies in
Europe. Secretary Dulles has made this point
crystal clear. lVithout Enc or a satisfactory al-
ternative, a NATO defense plan which contemplates
a forward strategy in defense of the Continent ap-
pears impracticable. Without further progress
