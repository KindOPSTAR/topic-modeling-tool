tion at the Commission’s regional ofﬁces in New
York, Chica , and San Francisco.
On Novem r 20, 1953, the Securities and Ex-
chan e Commission announced that it had under
consi eration a ro 088.1 to adopt a rule under
section 15 (c) (2 o the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 to prohibit brokers and dealers from trad-
ing in the oventhe-counter market in German se-
curities which are required to be and have not
been validated pursuant to the validation laws of
the Federal Re ublic of Germany. The Commis-
sion has consi ered all of the comments and su -
gestions received and has adopted Rule -
15C2-3 in the form stated below.
This new rule makes it a “fraudulent, deceptive,
or mani ulative act or practice,” as used in sec-
tion 15 (Bi) (2) of the act, for any broker or dealer
to effect an transaction in, or to induce the pur-
chase or en e of, any German security required to
be validated under applicable validation laws of
the Federal Republic of Germany unless it has
been duly validated. If such security is a dollar
securit , it must have attached to it a document
of the alidation Board for German Dollar Bonds
certifying to the validation of such security. The
Commission has been informed by representatives
of the various exchanges upon which German se-
curities have been traded that securities which
have not been validated will not be considered
“ delivery” against sales made on these ex-
0 anges.
The Commission has been informed that, where
the authenticit of an outstanding dollar securit
has been estab ished, the Validation Board wil
attach to each such dollar security a document cer-
tifyin to its validation. Con uently, Rule
X-15 2-3 provides that a German ollar security
required to be validated cannot be traded unless
this document is attached to it. Since the Com-
mission has no assurance that a validated security
other than a dollar securit will have any docu-
ment certifying to its vali ation attached to it, a
broker or dealer pro osing to eﬂ'ect a transaction
in such a security wil have to be certain that it has
been duly validated; if he should effect a trans-
action in a security not validated as required he
would be violating Rule X-15C2-3 if the mails or
other jurisdictional elements are involved.
Persons wishing information regarding the vali~
dation of German dollar securities should com-
municate with the Validation Board for German
Dollar Bonds, 30 Broad Street, New York 4, N.Y.
Information concerning the validation of securi-
ties other than dollar securities may be obtained
from the Foreign Re resentative of the German
Federal Republic, 30 road Street, N.Y. 4., N.Y.
In view of the above, the Commission feels that
it is appropriate to withdraw its request that
brokers and dealers refrain from effecting trans-
actions in West German securities to the extent
that such trading is not prohibited under the pro-
visions of its new Rule X-15C2—3. The Commis-
sion’s action, of course, should not be construed
to mean that it has in any way passed upon the
merits of any of the securities which are permitted
to be traded.
The Commission has no information when vali-
dation procedures will be established for dollar
securities of issuers in that part of Germany under
the control of the Soviet or Polish Governments.
Therefore, the Commission after consultation
with the Department of State, requests that
brokers and dealers continue to abstain from any
activities which would tend to create a public
market in these securities. While the Commis-
sion has been advised that negotiations are under
way to establish validation rocedures for Aus-
trian dollar securities, the mmission requests
that the securities industry also refrain from trad-
ing these securities until further notice after the
establishment of validation procedures. The
Commission is not in possession 0 any information
which it feels would 'ustify it in withdrawin its
earlier request that rokers and dealers regain
from tradin in securities issued by Bulgaria,
Hungary, an Rumania and by issuers in any of
these countries.
Statutory lash
Rule X-15C2-3 is adopted ursuant to the pro-
visions of the Securities Exc an Act of 1934,
particularly sections 15 (c) (2) an 23 (a) thereof,
the Commission deeming such action necessary
and appropriate in the public interest and for the
protection of investors and necessary for the exe-
cution of the functions vested in it under the act.
In accordance with the rovisions of section 4 (c)
of the Administrative rocedure Act, the Com-
mission ﬁnds that there is good cause for making
this rule eﬂective before the expiration of 30 days
after its publication because brokers and dealers
subject to the rule have been refraining from ef-
fectin transactions in the securities covered by
the ru e at the uest of the Commission, and
it is necessary inretlie public interest and for the
rotection of investors that the rule be made ef-
ective before the expiration of said 30-day period.
