bility, or to attain the permanent and essential
reconciliation of France and Germany.
Decision cannot wait upon ideal conditions,
which are not likely to materialize. Drift and
indecision would only mean increasing insecurity
rising economic pressures, social tensions, political
radicalism, and “crisis governments.”
F orsaking the past and its conﬂicts, the six
nations have set out on the more hopeful road to-
ward unity. The results thus far are encouraging.
Persistent efforts to maintain the momentum
should insure that the E00 and the political statute
are carried through and put into effect.
It is not too much to say that the future of
Europe hangs on the early success of these efforts.
The situation will not stand still. The present
historic opportunity can be lost by indecision or
delay. Grim realities demand that the six states
overcome fears and hesitations and go forward,
without faltering, in hammering out tighter bonds
of union.

American Assistance to
Netherlands Flood Victims
White House press release dated January 15
Following is the text of a letter received by the
President {ram Her Majesty Queen Julia/ha of
the N ether ands:
MR. Pansmnn'r,
Now that the last gap in the dykes has recently
been closed, I feel impelled to address myself to
you and the American eo 1e, moved by a deep
sense of gratitude. T e oods which ravaged
our country in February have brought great dis-
tress to hundreds of thousands of my compatriots
and caused extensive damage. It has been a great
comfort, however, that with a s ontaneity to
which history furnishes no paral el, sympathy
with the victims was shown from all sides while
valuable active assistance was given as well.
You sent us aeroplanes, helicopters and am-
phibious vehicles which have proved to be a tre-
mendous help during the rescue work; goods and
clothes were collected from all over the United
States and considerable amounts of money were
raised. You did even more than that : units of your
armed forces rushed up; by their utmost exertions,
toiling day and night on the inundated lands at
the risk of their own lives under the most un-
favourable weather conditions, they saved victims
and their cattle and helped in plu ging the innu-
merable breaches in the dykes. Aﬁ those who did
their utmost to help us have earned our deep-felt
gratitude because they have proved that human
solidarity does not stop at frontiers. On behalf
of the Victims and all m compatriots I address
myself to you and, in domg so, to the American
people to express what can hardly be expressed
in words: our heart-felt thanks for everytlnng you
did when the sea—our faithful friend and eternal
enemy—held our country in its crushing grip.
I seize this opportunity to convey to you, Mr.
President, my sincere wishes both for the pros-
pzrity of the Republic and for your personal well-
ing.
