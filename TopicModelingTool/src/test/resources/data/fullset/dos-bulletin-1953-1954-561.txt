battle of Dien-Bien-Phu. Once the battle is
joined, nothing should be withheld as long as suc-
cess is possible. \Vhatever contribution the United
States can make to help prevent the Communist
conquest of Southeast Asia and to help the gallant
band that is defending this advance post from
being overrun cannot be withheld because of er-
centage ﬁgures. I would like to emphasize t at,
in my opinion and insofar as the free world is
concerned, the French Union forces at Dien-Bien-
Phu are ﬁghting a modern Thermopylae.
Consultations With U.K., France
Regarding Southeast Asia
Statement by Secretary Dulles
White House press release dated April 10
I have just been talking with President Eisen-
hower about the quick trip to Europe which I am
making. I am getting off tonight for London
and for Paris, and I expect to be back by the end
of the week. I am going in order to consult with
the British and French Governments about some
of the very real problems that are involved in
creating the obviously desirable united front to
resist Communist aggression in Southeast Asia.
As President Eisenhower said at a recent press
conference, the area is very important from the
standpoint of its people, its economic resources,
and from the standpomt of its strategic position
in the world.
Today the forces of aggression seem to be con-
centrating just at one point, at Dien-Bien-Phu
now, where the resistance is extremely gallant
against overwhelmin odds.
But actually the anger is not at one point.
There is danger to the entire area. It aﬁ‘ects the
vital interests of many nations in Southeast Asia
and in the Western Paciﬁc, includin the Philip-
pines and Australia and New Zealan , with whom
we have mutual security treaties.
Already the Government of Thailand, one of
the United Nations members which has sent troo s
to ﬁght with the United Nations in Korea, to (1
me yesterday that their Government was entirely
in agreement with our views and that they would
join with us in creating this united front to save
Southeast Asia.
This Government believes that, if all of the free
peoples who are now threatened unite against the
threat, then the threat can be ended. The Com-
munist bloc, with its vast resources, can win suc-
cess by overwhelming one by one little bits of
freedom. But it is different if we unite. Our
purpose is not to extend the ﬁghting but to end
the ﬁ hting. Our purpose is not to prevent a
peace ul settlement to the forthcomin Geneva
conference but to create the unity of Tree wills
needed to assure a peaceful settlement which will
in fact preserve the vital interests of us all.
Unity of urpose calls for a full understanding.
It seemed t at this understanding would be pro-
moted if I would personally go to London to talk
to the British Government and go to Paris to talk
to the French Government so that there could
be a more satisfactory exchan e of views than is
possible by the exchange of ca led messages.
It was M. Bidault, Mr. Eden, and I who at Ber-
lin agreed to have the Geneva conference to dis-
cuss peace in Korea and Indochina. Now the
three of us need to join our strength and add to
it the stren h of others in order to create the con-
ditions nee ed to assure that that conference will
not lead to a loss of freedom in Southeast Asia,
but will preserve that freedom in peace and justice.
That is the purpose of my trip. It is, I empha-
size, a mission of peace through strength.
U.S. and U.K. To Discuss
Enemy Property Claims
Press release 183 dated April 8
The Department of State and the Oﬁice of Alien
Property, Department of Justice, expect to hold
meetings about the middle of May 1954 in \Vash'
ington with representatives of the British Enemy
Property Custodian’s Ofﬁce. The purpose of these
meetings is to discuss conﬂicting claims to enemy
property arising between the United States and
Great Britain. In the course of these discussions
cases will be taken up involving American interests
in property in Great Britain which may have been
seized or blocked as enemy property.
The Department on February 6, 1951, issued
press release 931 requesting claimants to report
to the Department of State any American interests
' roierty in Allied or neutral countries seized
or 100 ed as “enemy” property. Individuals hav-
ing claims with relation to property in Great Brit-
ain, which have heretofore not been submitted are
invited to submit them urgently and before May
15 to the Department of State, as it is expected
that the meetings will provide the last opportunity
for securing protection for such claims. If a com-
munication has been transmitted to the Depart-
ment by claimants with relation to property in
Great Britain, it is suggested that it would be
helpful to submit any information which would
be needed to bring the communication up to date.
