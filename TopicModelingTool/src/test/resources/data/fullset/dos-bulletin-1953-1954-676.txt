I was not referring in any we to, or casting
aspersions upon, the natural fee in of afﬁnity
one feels for a brother of his own re igious faith
wherever he may be. The principles 0 the United
States on matters of religious freedom are so well
known that this assertion of mine should need no
ex ansion.
or was I referring in any way to proper phil-
anthropic support in its broadest sense, by Ameri-
can citizens of Jewish faith in the economic
development necessar to achieve a reasonable
standard of living of srael’s peo le—nor to sup-
port of religious, educational, an cultural enter-
prises in Israel. There is no divergence between
our Government and American citizens of the Jew-
ish faith who are interested in the development
and welfare of the State of Israel.
What I was referrin to were matters of ve
concern in my own ﬁech of foreign affairs. s an
example, let us consider, for instance, the question
of immi ation into Israel, in connection with the
fear I give just mentioned on the part of the
Arabs.
If we can turn to logic, it seems to me that this
particular aspect of the overall problem should be
one within the realm of possible correction. It is
a fact now that immigration has fallen oﬁ to in-
signiﬁcant numbers, and there is often a close
balance between incoming and outgoing for any
given period. It is also in all probability a fact
that natural factors, including the economics of
the situation, would revent people from volun-
tarily crowding toget er to where overpo ulation
could reach the danger point. It is also a act that
in the est 6 years most of the historic trouble
s ots or world Jewry have been evacuated.
here remain in the world only two areas where
really large populations of those of Jewish faith
still live. One of these is the United States. It
does not seem to me to be a fact that a great mass
of Americans of Jewish faith are about to emigrate
and take on Israeli citizenshi . The other area is
the Soviet Union and its satel ites. We know that
the lot of the Jews behind the Iron Curtain, like
that of many other religious or ethnic groups, is
a miserable one, and our heart goes out to them as
to all others in that category. Yet we do not see
the Kremlin opening its gates, with all the obvious
disadvanta s to it of such a break in its curtain,
to release t ese unfortunate people of the Jewish
faith. If and when the Soviets decide to do so, it
will be because of their desire to set the area aﬂame
b fostering new and greater trouble in the Middle
ast. If such an eventuality actually happened,
the magnitude of the problem would be such that
the whole free world, not just Israel, would have to
concern itself with the resettlement of Jewish
immigrants from behind the Iron Curtain.
One might expect all the above should be so well
known that the subject of immigration into Israel
should not be a source of tension. This, unfortu-
nately, is not the case. It is not peculiar to this
area of the world that one suspects his enemy of
the worst and never the best. In the emotions
which surround this problem, such sheer logic does
not spread. What does spread like wildﬁre
throughout the Middle East is a series of state-
ments from Israel calling for greatly expanded
immigration. A constant fear is that these
urgings in terms of extra millions will be heeded.
Their fears are enhanced b the knowledge that
the only limitation impose by statute on immi-
gration into Israel is, in fact, the total number of
those of the Jewish faith in the entire world.
The Arabs know the capacity of the territory of
Israel is limited. They see only one result—fu-
ture attempt at territorial expansion—and hence
warfare of serious proportions.
My friends, can one be in'ecting himself into
improper ﬁelds by speakin o matters such as this
that lie deep at the roots 0 a conﬂict so dangerous
to us? I realize I am referring to matters on
which strong religious and humanitarian feelings
exist on the part of many. I can only implore
those who have such feelings not to ignore the
feelings of others nor the daggers of the world in
which we live. Surely it is not asking too much
to ask Israel to ﬁnd some way to lay at rest these
fears of her neighbors and remove this specter—
which does not seem to be based upon reality—-
from minds in the Middle East. The tensions of
the Middle East, which are translating themselves
into almost daily needless loss of human lives,
could be considerably lessened if wise statesman-
ship could ﬁnd a way of such accomplishment.
DISTIIIST 0F U.S. MOTIVB
Another fundamental which I believe American
citizens in particular must consider is the fact
that there is a great deal of mistrust of the great
powers and, in particular, the United States on
the Arab-Israeli issue. This ma come as a shock
to many an American who wou d ﬁnd it hard to
believe that our motives could be so misunderstood.
I believe the Arab world today believes that
the United States would not allow an attack by
them upon Israel with the purpose of driving her
into the sea. I also believe, however, that in gen-
eral the Arab people are not convinced that the
opposite is true—and that they question our ability
to fulﬁll our obligations in opposing aggression
under the Tripartite Declaration of 19503 if Is-
rael herself should decide upon expansive aggres-
sion. I do not believe they doubt the sincerity of
the leaders of our Government when they clearly
restate our adherence to that declaration—but
they wonder at our ability to follow through.
They wonder if the domestic olitical aspects of
such a roblem in the Unite States, as well as
within t e domestic scenes of our allies—but par-
ticularl in the United States—might not make it
impossible for us to live up to our stated intentions.
