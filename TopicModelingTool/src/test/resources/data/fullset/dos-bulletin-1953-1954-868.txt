from our thinking. Perhaps if the earth were as
large as Jupiter (with about 120 times the sur-
face area of the earth) we could protest with some
reason that it was too much for human beings to
comprehend. But we need to introduce each en-
eratlon at a relatively early age to concepts 0 the
world as a whole, to its “wholeness-properties,”
and to the fact that the whole is more than the
sum of all its parts, as the body is more than a
mere aggre ation of organs and parts. A young
generation as already begun to think in terms
of subatomic particles (without having to unlearn
anything) and knows that matter is not simply
“solid, massy, hard, im enetrable, moveable part1-
cles,” as deﬁned by ir Isaac Newton in 1707.
They easily become accustomed to models of atoms,
with nuclei comprising protons and neutrons and
with electrons moving in planetary orbits. When
children begin early to see and think in world
terms, realistically related to the roundness of the
earth, the solution of world problems will become
tractable.
What a wonderful little celestial ball we live
on! To millions of its human tenants it is “the
good earth,” to little tracts of which they are
passionately attached. To its myriad indescrib-
able beauties they are keenly sensitive—to visible
beauties, only a small part of which have yet been
caught in color photography, to its audible
beauties, as in the tidal wave of birdsong that
sweeps around the earth daily ahead of the sun-
rise. Sweeping along in its orbit around the sun
at more than 18 miles per second (a velocity much
exceeding the swiftest modern projectiles), yet
stable enough for towering skyscrapers, it pro-
vides the stage upon which all natural and
human history has been and is being played.
With its ﬂowers in crannied walls and light
received from inﬁnitely distant galaxies and
island universes, it is tinged with mystery and
wonder enough to entrance generations for all
time to come. As we ﬁt together all the bits of in-
formation we learn about atoms and stars and
about the age of the universe and of the earth,
we recall the Greek dictum, “That which is ﬁrst as
cause is last in discovery.” And when we trace
our geographical data on globes and part-globes,
we shall probably realize that the world of human
relationships, in which we are so intimately in-
volved, is less simple than we sometimes assume
and that there are global patterns in human aﬁairs
far greater than we yet perceive.

U.S., Turkey Dlscuss Matters
of Common Interest
TEXT OF JOINT COMMUNIQUE 1
Press release 800 dated June 6
The Governments of the United States and
Turkey wish to express their mutual satisfac-
tion as a result of the visit of Prime Minister
Adnan Menderes to Washington. It has ro-
vided a valuable opportunity for the Tur 'sh
Prime Minister to discuss thoroughly with Pres-
ident Eisenhower, Secretary of State Dulles, Sec-
retary of Defense Wilson, FOA Director Stassen,
and other high ranking United States ofﬁcials
matters of common interest to the two countries.
During his visit the Prime Minister also met
with members of Congress who are active in com-
mittees concerned with foreign affairs. In such
meetings Mr. Menderes engaged in a frank ex-
change of views and opinions relative to the com-
mon goals and interests of our two countries.
Further, the visit afforded an occasion for the
Prime Minister to place before the United States
Government a clear and forceful statement of
Turkish policy to act as a convinced and deter-
mined member of NATO, to develop closer political
and military ties with other friendly nations in
the free world, in and out of NATO, and to support
the mutual efforts of the United States and other
free nations to organize for world security.
The official visit has also rovided another op-
portunity for the United tates Government to
reafﬁrm its recognition of the fact that Turkey
has assumed a defense posture which includes a
modernized armed force and which places a heavy
strain upon the resources of its country and eople,
and that substantial assistance from the nited
States and from other free nations who are in a
position to render such assistance is necessary in
order to permit the attainment of our common
objectives for a collective defense. In this direc-
tion, the United States Government intends to con-
tinue to base its program of military assistance to
the Republic of Turkey toward meeting the re-
quirements of the NA'ro-ap roved Turkish force
goals. In order to enable ’lgirkey to meet the re-
quirements of her armed forces under the above
program during the coming year, the United
States Government, subject to the action of Con-
gress and a review of commitments and priorities,
is disposed to increase its presently approved mil-
itary assistance program. The United States
Government is further prepared to accelerate de-
liveries of items in the present pipeline of roughly
one-half billion dollars of military equipment

‘ Issued at the conclusion of the visit to Washington of
Adnan Menderes, Prime Minister of Turkey, June 1-5.
