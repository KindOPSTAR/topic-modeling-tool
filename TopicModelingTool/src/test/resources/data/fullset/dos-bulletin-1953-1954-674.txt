see to all nations who strive for continued freedom.
The American wonders why these sources of fric-
tion cannot be cured. He feels his Government
should do what it can to case these trouble spots.
He sees them as diverting energies that are needed
for creating strength and a better standard of
living. These he would wish for all free people
instinctively; now he sees in the absence 0 such
conditions a threat to his own welfare and security.
Our own emergence as a leader in the free world,
and the inherent responsibilities thereof, coupled
with the fact that we see for the ﬁrst time a con-
tinuin and grave threat to our security, make it
inevita le that we should attempt to be a factor
leading toward progress and stability across the
entire Middle East. This is a trend of historical
signiﬁcance which has an important bearing upon
our approach to, and concern over each of the
factors of instability in the Middle East.
Whenever the United States became concerned
about the security of the Middle East as a Whole—
and I believe the process started in earnest some
two or three years ago, certain consequences bear-
ing upon our central subject for this evening would
also be inevitable. We would see on the one hand
the people of Israel become restive and to a certain
extent emotionally excitable over what the conse-
quences of such a trend might mean to them. They
would wonder how far our concern with conditions
in the area as a whole would lead to a lessening of
interest of America toward the support of Israel.
In their concern they might imagine that the ef-
forts of the United States across the area would
lead us to seek friendships at the ex ense of the
interests of their own state. The Ara peoples, on
the other hand, sensing a new importance in our
eyes, might conclude that their bar aining position
had risen. Some of them wou d press relent-
lessly—as they sensed the move of the pendulum—
to shove it all the way so that a policy of “impartial
friendship” would in eﬂ'ect mean com lete par-
tiality toward their side. They would thus be
critical of honest efforts of the United States to
car out this policy of impartiality. Criticism
wou d thus be in store for the United States from
both sides of the Arab-Israeli Armistice lines.
It seems to me we have reached the stage in this
process where each side honestly feels we are par-
tial to the other. In a crude sort of way perha 5
this could be called pro ess—progress toward t e
ultimate oal of havmg 0th sides feel we are truly
impartia . It is not a situation, however, about
which one can take pleasure. It is, for instance, a
concern to us that Israel is prone to see dangers to
herself in such a process and to exaggerate far
beyond what seem to us to be the realities of the
situation. We see no basis in our acts to justify
her fear that her legitimate interests are placed in
jeopardy by United States concern over the area
as a whole. We might rather ask her what would
be the fate of her State—as we can, of course, ask
the Arabs as well—if the Middle East continued
in turmoil and the whole of the area was lost to
the control and inﬂuence of the Soviet Union.
To understand our concern over developments in
this part of the world, it is necessary to understand
that we do see an increasing danger that the Middle
East may be relegated to a satellite status under
the Soviet Union. Most peo la in the Middle East
who read this statement wil label it as “alarmist”
and without foundation of fact. The very fact
that this reaction will exist is partly the cause of
our concern.
Growlnl Danger of Soviet Aggmslon
It has been my view that the Middle East, on
the timetable of the Soviet Union, has been placed
in priority behind that of Europe and the Far
East simply because they look upon it as an area
that can wait. The more Russia’s aggressive moves
are stalemated in Europe and the Far East, the
more the danger grows for the Middle East.
There are now a number of indications that
Sovret intentions are being focused to a new de-
gree upon this part of the world. Throughout
my entire tenure in my present position, I have
been expectlng this change of attitude to show
itself Within the United Nations. This has now
ha )pened. The Arab-Israeli conﬂict, so often
be ore the United Nations, has until rocentl been
free of abusive veto ower of the Soviet nion.
They have now wiel ed their veto twice in suc-
CQSIOH on this matter in the Security Council.
They are stepping 11 their pro aganda among
the groups in the Mi dle East who are suffering
most acute] from the prolongation of tensions
and hardships occasioned thereby—and who are
thus most susceptible to such propaganda. It
must be obvious to an one that, if the Soviet
Union were to succeed in an effort to move into
that area and accomplish there what they have
accomplished in North Korea, in China, and in
the satellite countries of Eastern Euro , the free
countries of both Europe and the Far East, would
be outflanked and in eatly increased peril. The
land gateway to Africa would be 0 n. The tre-
mendous resources of the area wou d be in enemy
hands.
Many in the Arab world see this extension of the
hand of Russia as a friendly move to take their
Side of the case against Israel. They have sent
messages of appreciation to Moscow. I believe
this facade of friendship to be indeed a motive
of the Kremlin—but I believe it to be only a b -
product of their real intentions. In this, as 1n
many other past acts of the Kremlin, we see a
double objective. One of these, and it is the
lesser, is to make the Arab world feel Russia has
honest friendly intentions toward them. The
other, and this we see as their primary objective,
1s to stymie United Nations action in order to
maintain and increase the dangerous tensions that
exist within the area. If we can derive any bene-
