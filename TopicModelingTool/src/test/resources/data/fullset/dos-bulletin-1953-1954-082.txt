Telecommunications Policy and the Department of State
by Richard T. Black
A moment's reﬂection will serve to reveal the
extent of man’s reliance upon the means for a rapid
exchange of intelligence. In little more than a
century the crude novelties of Morse, Marconi, and
Bell have become everyday necessities. In the
United States life would be unthinkable for mil-
lions of citizens without the telephone. One or
more radio receivers are ﬁxtures in almost every
home and, as a result of its phenomenal popular
acceptance, television is no longer a phenomenon
but a commonplace. Lem commonly recognized
is the staggering demand imposed upon our com-
munications system by the operations of business,
industry, and government.
Enormous investments have been made by pri-
vate industry and by the U. S. Government to
meet the need for international communications
alone. Foreign trade would occupy a much less
signiﬁcant position in our economy were it not
for the eas access to adequate communications
facilities en]oyed by commercial interests. In these
crucial times the same facilities are indispensable
to the Government in maintaining almost instan-
taneous contact with its listening posts abroad.
It is axiomatic that military communications are
of the most vital im ortance, and as an adjunct
to the cold war the issemination of information
through broadcasting and other telecommunica-
tions‘ services is hardly less signiﬁcant. The de-
pendence of the press and newsgatherin agencies
upon overseas communications is so 0 vious as
scarcely to deserve mention. The standards of
safety achieved by ocean vessels and more ar-
ticular] ' by civil and militar aircraft would) be
impossi le in the absence 0 modern electronic
communications and navigational devices.
No clear distinction can be made between na-
tional and international communications. At the
21:50]]! stage of technical development, the radio-
quency spectrum is a limited resource incapable
‘ In annex 2 ot the International Telecommunication
Convention (Atlantic City. 1947) “telecommunication” is
deﬁned as any transmission. emission, or reception of
signs. signals, writing. images and sounds, or intelligence
of any nature by wire. radio. visual. or other electro-
magnetic systems.
of satisfying the claims of all potential users. Nor
can electro-magnetic radio waves be conﬁned with-
in national borders. The travel freely across the
earth, interfering with ot er, similar waves when
not controlled by international agreement. The
continued expansion of radio, wire, and cable fa-
cilities is necessarily accompanied by negotiations
for their construction, maintenance, and use.
In no ﬁeld of scientiﬁc advance is the techno-
logical shrinking of the world more apparent than
in telecommunications; in none is the need for co-
0 rative leadership more pressing. \Vithin the
I nited States the limited resources of communica-
tions are sought by a number of claimant agencies,
each of whose needs must be evaluated and some-
how met. The responsibility for this task is
shared between the President, acting throu h vari-
ous government agencies of the Executive ranch
and the Congress, rincipally through the Federal
Communications ommission. \Vherever domes-
tic requirements impinge upon the corresponding
requirements of other countries, there must be a
focal point for the coordination of interests. Un-
der its overall res onsibility for the conduct of
foreign affairs, the ' epartment of State, and with-
in the De )artment the Telecommunications Policy
Staff, is c larged with this coordinating function.
Internationally, the common meeting ground for
the exposition and resolution of telecommunica-
tions problems is found within the framework of
the International Telecommunication Union,
(I'm) a specialized agency of the United Nations.
The International Telecommunication Union
derives from the earlier International Telegraph
Union, which was established in 1865. The ear-
liest of the international organizations boasting a
continuously operating administrative structure,
the Telegraph Union exerted a substantial inﬂu-
ence upon the structure of later organizations,
notably the League of Nations. Although the
original aims of the Union were modest, being
Erimarily concerned with wire telegraphy on the
uropean continent, the creation of such an organ-
ization was indicative of the need for international
cooperation in the orderly development of com-
