cerns most immediately those countries on the
borders of the Communist empire that are most
exposed to its ra acity. The United States has
drawn upon itsel the ire of the Communists be-
cause those countries have looked to us to support
them and have not looked in vain. \Vhile the
Soviet Union has, of course, the power to attack
the United States directly, it is where we have been
assisting those directly threatened—Greece,
Turkey, the countries of Western Europe, Berlin
and the German Federal Republic, Southeast Asia
and, of course, Korea above all—that we have
come into conﬂict with the USSR. The Soviet
Russians are quite aware of this, much as they
would like to have the world believe that it is only
capitalist America that stands in the way of um-
versal peace and brotherhood. We could put an
end overnight to the anti-American propaganda
pouring out of Moscow and Peiping. We could
present the world with a spectacle of the most
fraternal association between Americans and
Soviet Russians and Chinese Communists. We
could eliminate with a single gesture all those
bothersome tensions we hear so much about. All
we should have to do is wash our hands of the
countries on the borders of the Communist empire
and leave them to the mercies of what Chou En-lai
calls “The cam of peace and democracy headed
by the Soviet glnion.” But that would be, of
course, the last wa in which to serve our own
interests. It woul lead to the progressive over-
powering of the rest of the free world and ulti-
mately to our own destruction.
The second oint to be em hasized is that our
reason for wis ing to see the ]Japanese build ade-
quate defense forces is emphaticall not because
we wish to see the Japanese ﬁghting the Com-
munists. The primary purpose of an army is not
to ﬁght. It is quite the opposite. The primary
purpose of an army is to secure the national ob-
]ectives without ﬁghting. To the Soviet Union,
the Red Army is primarily a weapon of intimida-
tion to be used in causing other countries to cave
in without the ﬁring of a shot. To us in the free
world, our own armed forces are the means of
preventing that from happening and of maintain-
ing our safety in eace. We know only too well
that military establishments are ex ensive. We
look forward to the day when the viet Union
will a cc to a fair system of disarmament. And
we be ieve that the sooner all sectors of the free
world are adequately strong, the sooner that day
will come.
Opponents to Japanese Rearmament
Some Japanese, as well as some others in the Far
East, are 0 posed to Japanese rearmament be-
cause they ﬁéar it would mean a recrudescence of
the military caste in Japan. I believe they are
too much inﬂuenced by the past. Just as we were
thinkin too much in terms of 1941 when we dis-
armed apan, so those fearful of Japanese mili-
tarism today are, I believe, thinking in terms of
May 1932 and February 1936, when vicious attacks
were launched on the Japanese civil government
by groups of army officers. It seems to us that
the conditions of 1954 are distinctly different.
The Japanese people are now possessed of the
means required to prevent the accumulation of
power in the hands of a military caste. They have
free elections; they have a representative Diet;
they have a free press; they have a Constitution
in which human rights are ﬁrmly embedded; and
above all, they have the experience of the past
ever before them.
To assume that, because Japan embarked on
imperialist adventures in the past, she is likely
to do so a aim is to take a hopeless view of human
affairs. owever much we may lament it, the
fact is that many of the most res ected members
of the family of nations have yiel ed to imperial-
ist urges in the past. Militarism, ex ansionism,
aggressiveness are—we must conclu e—not en-
demic with certain nationalities but epidemic un-
der certain economic, social, and political condi-
tions. \Ve should be watchful not of articular
races but of particular circumstances t at cause
nations to act in certain ways.
J 2 an has, of course, made a beginning in the
deve opment of the means to protect herself. In
the future increase in the size of the Japanese De-
fense Forces, which the Japanese Government has
recognized is necessary, we have agreed to help by
providing major items of land, sea, and air equip-
ment. “'e may hope the time is not too remote
when Japan—in the words of the Security Treaty
of 1951—will be ready “to assume responsibility
for its own defense” and we can bring our troops
home. ‘
I have talked as if our expectations of Japan
lie altogether in the realm of resistance to Com-
munist military aggression. That is not my
meaning. The role that awaits‘ J a an is in our
view far broader than that. For I t link we must
recognize that Communist imperialism is only a
current symptom, and only one symptom, of an-
cient and deep-seated evils. The real enem is
the condition that produces communism. he
real problem is the problem of human desperation.
It is a pitiable as ect of human beings that the
more desperate and frightened they are, the read-
ier they are to grasp at panaceas and promises of
the mi lennium, the more susceptible they are to
counsels of violence and extremism, the quicker
they are to follow the fanatic. The world in our
lifetime has presented vast opportunities for im-
posing upon the credulities of suffering, bewil-
dered humanity. There has been the damage done
to men’s nerves by the ferocity of our wars, the
devastation left by those wars, the upsetting im-
pact of half-understood scientiﬁc discoveries upon
religious faiths, the bewilderment and confusion
of youths and intellectuals looking for something
to believe, the frustrations of submerged national-
