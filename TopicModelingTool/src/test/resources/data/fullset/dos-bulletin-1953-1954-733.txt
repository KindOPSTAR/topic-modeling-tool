period has also been exceptionally intense, the
investment rate approximating 16 percent of the
total national income. The stock of ca ital per
worker has risen, on the average, from 1,177 in
1945 to $1,491 in 1952, an increase of more than
25 percent. The outstanding feature of this de-
velopment has been the expansion in manufac-
tures. Value of manufactures increased from $6.8
million in 1945 to $11.4 million in 1952, an in-
crease of better than 70 percent in 7 years. The
value of manufactures surpassed the value of
agricultural output in Latin America in 1947 for
the ﬁrst time and has outranked it ever since.
The use of averages tends to obscure the rapidity
of the advance which has been made in such ﬁelds
as construction and iron and steel production. For
example, capacity for steel ingot production in
Latin America had risen to over 1.5 million tons
by the end of 1952, an increase of over 100 percent
in 5 years. Cement production has shown an
equally high rate of increase. The paper indus-
try, especially in Brazil and Mexico, has also
grown rapidly. There has been a considerable in-
crease in the production of basic chemical prod-
ucts, synthetic ﬁbers, fertilizers, and antibiotics.
This really remarkable rate of economic r0 -
ress in Latin America has been very large y -
nanced out of Latin America’s own resources. It
is estimated that over 90 percent of the resources
that have one into economic development in Latin
America uring this period have been derived
from their own savings. The remainder has been
su plied by foreign investors, private and public.
tin Americas economic relations with the
United States in both of these ﬁelds are signiﬁcant.
Private investment has ﬂowed into Latin America
from the United States since the end of the Second
World War at the average rate of around $250
million per year. In addition, American compa-
nies have relnvested earnings at the average rate
of approximately $190 million per year.
The United States Government has supple-
mented this ﬂow of private ca ital. Durin the
period since the Second Wor (1 War the tin
American countries have been receiving loans
through the International Bank, of which we are
a member, and our own Export-Import Bank on a
net basis (loans less repayments) at the rate of
$93 million per year, of which the Export-Import
Bank has provided about 75 percent.
Our Government has also assisted through its
technical cooperation program. This program,
although small in relation to the total capital in-
vested in the area, has been substantial and has
helped to point the way to further development.
The United States has appropriated $163 million
for this pro am since it was ﬁrst be un. Of
ater signi cance than the ﬁnancial out ay is the
gist that it has helped, through setting up demon-
stration rojects, to show how progress can be
made un er local leadership through the utiliza-
tion of modern technology.
Measured by almost any standard the rate of
economic progress in Latin America since the
war is one of the highest in the world, and sub-
stantially exceeds our own. Despite this amaz-
ing rate of progress, it is true that Latin America
has not yet in a span of a very few decades achieved
that de ree of economic develo ment which was
the resu t of a century and a hal or more of slower
progress in other arts of the world. But this
should be no cause or disappointment. It is true
that progress has not been uniform, but it is safe
to say that seldom in history has so large an area
progressed at such a rate in so short a time. Yet
the people of Latin America, far from being satis-
ﬁed with these achievements, are determined to
sur ass them. To that effort we shall contribute
wit enthusiasm. That determination that still
greater things must lie ahead is the genius of this
new world.
The great pro ess in Latin America in recent
years has, nevert eless, been overwhelmingl due
to the genius, industry, and capital of the tin
Americans themselves. The accomplishments of
the past 15 years furnish convincing evidence of
what can be achieved in the future. Judged by
any standard it is abundantly apparent that the
economy of Latin America is on the march and
that a eat and satisfyin future lies ahead of
its eop e and of their chil ren.
have been asked wh , if we recognize a pecu-
liar relationship with tin America, we have
never established for it anything comparable to
the Marshall plan. This question comes from
those who understandably point to our vast ex-
penditures in those areas of the world which were
either devastated by war or which are today criti-
cal in a military sense, and ask why we have not
made comparable expenditures within our own
family of merican nations.
There has been no Marshall plan for Latin
America and I pray that a need for one will never
exist. Latin America has not been devastated
by either of the two world wars, nor is it today
threatened by the armed forces of Communist
Russia or China. Instead, its position is precisely
that of the United States. Together with Canada
we comprise the most privileged area of the world,
an area still relatively safe from all but air at-
tack; an area where men and women enjoy per-
sonal freedoms existing only in isolated areas
elsewhere in the world. Yet we in this hemi-
sphere, and precisely because of our privileged
situation, must shoulder a great part of the ﬁnan-
cial burden of liberating the rest of the world
from the Communist threat. All such expendi-
tures are of an essentially security nature. They
have at times taken the form of grants for the
reconstruction of devastated industries. Their
innumerable other forms are familiar to all of us.
Their basic purpose has uniformly, however, been
to contain and push back the forces of communism.
