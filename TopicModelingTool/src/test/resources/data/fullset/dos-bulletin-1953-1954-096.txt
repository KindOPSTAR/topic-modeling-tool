religious, charitable, and philanthropic groups for
the welfare of these people amounting to about
$8,000,000.
The stake of this Government in the Near East,
as related to the refugee problem, is clearly stated
in the report of the Sub-Committee on the Near
East and Africa of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, dated July 24, 1953:
The United States has an interest in doing what it
can to help solve the refugee problem because of its di-
i'ect relationship to the economic and political stability
and the security of the Near East. The United States
does not wish to see the internal order and the inde-
pendence of the countries of the Near East threatened
by economic chaos. (‘,ommunist penetration, or military
hostilities. Disorder with a resultant possibility of the
renewal of hostilities in this part of the world would
threaten the security interest of the United States and
the free world generally.
The extent to which the United States Govern-
ment has demonstrated its interest and concern is
given in Section VII below.
V. Present Sltuetlon of the Refugees
There are now 870,000 registered refugees re-
ceiving relief from the United Nations Relief and
Works Agency for Palestine Refugees. They are
distributed as follows:


In addition, about 5,000 in Iraq are being assisted
by that Government.
The 1600 calorie daily ration furnished by the
United Nations Relief and Works Agency, con-
sisting chieﬂy of ﬂour, dried vegetables, oils, and
fats, 18 considered a minimum sustaining ration.
The cost per erson for all relief is estimated at
slightl less t an $3.00 per month. One-third of
the re ugees now live in UNRWA camps, while the
remainder live in towns and villages, many of them
in make-shift shelter. Their numbers are grow-
ing as a result of a natural increase of between
twenty and twenty-ﬁve thousand annually.
Substantial numbers of them are close to their
former homes in what is now Israel. Many cross
the armistice lines to sow crops in the spring and
reap them in the fall. These, and crossin for
other purposes, often result in shooting incldents
and constitute a continuing source of tension be-
tween Israel and the Arab States, particularly
along the Israel-Jordan border.
Exce t in Jordan, the refugees have no citizen-
ship ans no employment rights. In Jordan, where
the re e population constitutes one-third of the
populatlon of the country, the presence of the ref-
ugees has tended to de ress wage levels and ad-
versely affect the alrea y low standard of living
revailing in that country. Moreover, there are
in addition about 120,000 who are not refugees, but
who have lost their means of livelihood as a result
of armistice lines which separate their homes from
their lands or places of occu ation.
In Lebanon where there is under-employment
of the indigenous peoples, the refugees are neither
accorded legal ermission to work nor the rights
of citizenship, ac to the delicate balance between
Christians and Moslems on which their political
system is based.
In Syria consideration is being given to legis-
lation which would permit the refugees to work
and to acquire citizenship.
In Gaza, a city of 80,000 before hostilities, con-
ditions are exceptionally deplorable because the
economic activity of that city has been severely
curtailed since it was cut off from its normal eco-
nomic life under the Palestine Mandate. The
addition of a. refu ee population of more than
200,000 in this smal strip, 25 miles long and 8 miles
wide, between the desert and the sea, has created
an impossible economic situation.
VI. Efforts To Resolve the Problem
The refugee problem has been inexorably linked
with the eneral problem of resolving outstand-
ing issues etween Israel and the Arab States. In
the words of the Under Secretary of State Walter
Bedell Smith,2
The refugee problem is the principal unresolved issue
between Israel and the Arabs. Outstanding issues are
generally listed as compensation to the refugees. repatria-
tion of the refugees, adjustment of boundaries, and the
status of Jerusalem and of the holy places. None of
these issues can be separated from the refugee problem
because that is the human problem.
Des ite the connection of the refugee problem
with the overall political problem, plans and pro-
ms were needed to provide for refu ee em-
ployment and the reduction of ration rol s with-
out awaiting settlement of other outstanding is-
sues. This need was ﬁrst reco ized in 1949 when
a United Nations Economic urvey Mission for
the Middle East was established under the chair-
manship of Mr. Gordon Clapp, Chairman of the
Board, Tennessee Valley Authority. This mis-
sion, after a ﬁeld survey, pointed to the need to
provide immediate employment for refugees on
useful works such as roads, aﬂ'orestation and ter-
racing, which did not requlre extensive planning.
At the same time it pointed to certain longer range
‘developmental possibilities in the countries shel-
tering the refugees and recommended a number of
pilot projects.
On the basis of the recommendations of the
Economic Survey Mission, the General Assembly,
on December 8, 1949 established the United Na—
tions Relief and Works Agency for Palestine
Refugees (UNRWA) to take over the relief opera-
tion initiated in 1948, and to undertake works
projects for refugee employment. These projects,
initiated by UNRWA in 1950, demonstrated that
