Fifth Annlvorsary of
Mlndszenty Imprisonment
White House press release dated February 4
The following letter from President Eisenhower
was sent on February 1 to Frederic L. Vorbeck,
Executive Chairman, United Catholic Organiza-
tions for the Freeing of Cardinal Illina'szenty,
Richmond Hill, N. Y.:
DEAR Mn. Voanncxz I have our telegram of
January twenty-third on beha f of the United
Catholic Organizations for the Freeing of Cardi-
nal Mindszenty. We in the free world have not
forgotten that this is the ﬁfth anniversary of
Cardinal Mindszenty’s trial and imprisonment by
the Communist authorities in Hungary.
The un'ust nature of the proceedings against
Cardinal indszenty is, of course, well known to
the American people. They regarded the attack
u on him as a blow ainst religious freedom in
ungar and an unprlncipled attempt to destroy
spiritual’and moral inﬂuences in that country;a
The Communist assault upon religious 1i rty
and leadership in Hungary has failed, however, to
turn the Hungarian eo le from their faith in
God. The light of ar inal Mindszenty and of
other churc en who have suffered at the hands
of the Communists has not been forgotten. Their
situation continues deepl to concern the people of
Hun ary and to evoke t e sympathy of the free
world. Despite the constraints of person and
silence imposed on Cardinal Mindszenty and other
church leaders by their ersecutors, the spirit of
these men has deﬁed confinement by the totalitar-
ian State. It has become, indeed, a symbol of
faith and freedom for our times.
Sincerely,
Dwrour D. EIBENHOWER

Presldent Asks Governors
To Visit Korea
White House press release dated February 11
Following is the text 0 a letter dated February
.9 from President Eisen ower to Dan Thornton,
Governor of Colorado, who is chairman of the
Governors’ Conference 1954:
Dean DAN: Our country, as you know, has an
important stake in the fortunes and destiny of the
Republic of Korea. Since the cessation of hostili-
ties there last July, we have continued to improve
its military position and have also assumed the
task of he ping to rebuild its war-torn economy.
The results of these endeavors will profoundly af-
fect our leadershi and prestige in the Far East
and indeed throug out the free world.
I am persuaded that a short visit to Korea by a
select group of State executives who are constantly
in direct touch with the American ple would be
highly beneﬁcial. Their rsona evaluation of
our pro ess would provi e the public with the
essentia knowledge and broad understanding to
which it is entitled.
Accordingly, I would be deeply appreciative if
you, together with other members of the Executive
Committee of the Governors’ Conference, could go
to Korea on or about A ril 1 and, upon your re-
turn, give an a praisal o? the situation there based
on ﬁrst-hand oliservation. Will you canvass your
Committee and advise me which Governors wish
to make the trip?
With kind regard,
Sincerely,
Dwmn'r D. Eisrzxnowm
