Vlli Pan American Railway Congress
In his report to the President on United States-
Latin American relations,‘ Special Ambassador
Milton S. Eisenhower noted that “Next to an in-
crease in agricultural production, development of
trans )ortation is the paramount need in most of
the atin American countries.” An important
contribution to the advancement of transportation
eﬂiciency and technical knowled e in Latin Amer-
ica was the VIII Pan American ailwa Congress
held at \Vashington and Atlantic City, une 12-25,
1953, under the auspices of the Pan American
Railway Congress Association. This Association
has for many years had as its primary concern the
establishment and development of more extensive
and more efﬁcient railroad facilities in the Amer-
icas, along with the promotion of international
arrangements to facilitate communication and
travel amon the nations of the Americas.
The Pan merican Railway Co ress Associa-
tion began its work in this ﬁeld as the South
American Railway Congress of 1907 in connec-
tion with the celebration of the 50th anniversary
of the ﬁrst railway built in Argentina. The ﬁrst
‘ Bvumn of Nov. 23, 1958, p. 695.
formal meeting of the organization was held in
1910 at Buenos Aires. Other meetings followed
at Rio de J aneiro in 1922, Santiago in 1929, and
Bogota in 1941, when the name was changed to
the Pan American Railway Congress Associa-
tion, and invitations to jom were extended to
countries of Central and North America. Fol-
lowing World War II, congresses were held at
Montevideo in 1946, Habana in 1948, and Mexico
City in 1950. Through these successive meetings,
the Association developed into a well-established
international or anization, with rights of mem-
bership extende not only to all the American
governments but also to public institutions, rail-
way companies, and interested private individ-
uals. Its aim of promoting the development and
progress of railways in the American Continent
was carried out by means of (a) periodic con-
gresses, (b) the publication of documents and
other works related to the Association’s objectives,
and (c) the maintenance of informative services
and studies of topics of general interest.
The Congress held last summer in the United
States was the eighth in the series of Pan Ameri-
