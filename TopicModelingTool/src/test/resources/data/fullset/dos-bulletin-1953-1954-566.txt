A feeling that India can best tackle her pressin
internal problems if she avoids becoming involve
in the “cold war” and that her inﬂuence can most
eﬁ'ectivel be exerted if she is not committed to
either si e.
A conviction that she only stands to lose by ut-
ting herself at least potentially in a position w ich
might oﬂ’end either the USSR. or Communist
China, particularly the latter, and, at the same
time, a reluctance to alienate herself from the
West.
A deep-seated fear and hatred of colonialism
and imperialism and an identiﬁcation of these with
the Western Powers, plus an awareness of the im-
plications of Communist totalitarianism.
A feelin that moral weight against war will
prevent it groin coming.
There are no doubt other motivations and it may
seem that contradictions exist in those I have just
listed, but it seems to me that these, put together
in varying degrees of importance may help to ex-
plain attitudes and expressions which appear puz-
zlin to many of us.
Vtge in the United States believe the cold war is
already on the subcontinent, as it is in every other
place in the world. It is there not through any-
thing we or the other free nations have done, but
through the actions and intentions of the Soviet
Union, Communist China, and the other satellites.
Lessons of Past Auraslon
One cannot lightly dismiss the lessons of aggres-
sion in Poland or Czechoslovakia or Korea. It
could happen in the Indian subcontinent. If it
does, how will India defend herself—alone, or in
the strong company of others who believe her in-
de endence should be guarded?
ollective security is the keystone of our foreign
olicy. In that concept, we think, lies the only
0 e of preventing another Poland or Czechoslo-
va ia or Korea.
While the United States had under considera-
tion the question of military aid to Pakistan, Paki-
stan and Turkey had been holding talks which re-
sulted on Februa 19, 1954, in an announcement
that they intende “to study methods of achiev-
ing closer, friendly collaboration in the olitical
economic, and cultural spheres as well as of
strengthening peace and security in their own in-
terest as also in that of all peace-loving nations.”
An agreement on these lines was signed at Karachi
on April 2.
The United States warmly welcomed this de-
velopment and its decision to extend military aid
to Pakistan was made within its context.
Now, these matters have not made relations be-
tween the United States and India easy. On the
problems of security, it may not seem that the two
countries are likely to reach agreement in the near
future. We believe we are right and I am sure
that the Indian Government believes it is right.
Indian leaders are as entitled to their opinions
as we are to ours, and it is not proﬁtable for either
of us to try to impose our viewpoint on the other.
But I do not concur with those who say that
friendshi is being destroyed between us. India
and the nited States are two great democracies.
We have more in common than we have in dis-
agreement.
Turning back, India, followin the partition of
the subcontinent, was faced with tremendous in-
ternal and external problems. There was the prob-
lem of unifying the nation into a single political
entity from more than 500 separate states. There
was the problem of an already overtaxed economy
bein thrown further off balance by the partition
itselg. There was the roblem of internal Com-
munist activity. And nally, there was the prob-
lem of India’s relations with her newly created
neighbor, Pakistan.
While the new India moved quickly and eﬁ'ec-
tively to meet some of its most pressmg internal
problems, the challen es were obviously too great
to be overcome imme iately. Further, there were
and are forces trying to move against what the
resent government of India considers its people’s
est interests.
The Communists, for example, both those in the
Kremlin and those in India taking their orders
from the Kremlin, don’t want a uniﬁed India. In
India, as in other countries where they seek to
ain power, they strive for disorder, disunity, and
iscontent.
We ﬁnd, for instance, that the Communists con-
sistently take the part of those who would weaken
the power of the central government. They con-
tinuously berate the concept of India’s Five Year
Plan. The belabor the slowness in coming of its
beneﬁts. 'they, as happened in our own country
during the depression, use the issue of unemploy-
ment to advance their aims.
lndla's Progress
However, Prime Minister Nehru’s government
has moved steadily forward to the solution of its
roblems. He himself has taken a strong anti-
lCommunist position. It is clear that he recognizes
the threat the Communists are to his countr . At
one time, he had about 7,000 of them in jai .
The general elections of 1951—52 which were
held to form the government were a model of
democratic rocedure. About 106 million people
voted. Unli e the Soviet system, the Indian sys-
tem gave them a wide range of parties and candi-
dates to choose from.
Uniﬁcation of the country, which man de-
scribed as an impossible task, was accomp 'shed
swiftly and efﬁciently.
Faced with a fantastically low living standard,
a desperate agricultural situation, the Indian Gov-
ernment has taken bold steps to increase food pro-
