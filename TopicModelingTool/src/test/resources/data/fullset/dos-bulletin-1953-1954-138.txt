NATIONAL SECURITY
Mutual NI llltary Prop-om
Because our own national security is vitally
dependent on the continued strength of our allies
throu hout the free world, we have undertaken
over t is past several years to assist them in build-
ing the military forces necessary to deter Com-
munist aggression from without or subversion
from within. Since the beginnin of the mutual
defense assistance program in scal year 1950,
when the armed strength of the free world was at
low ebb, $18 billion have been made available to
furnish military equipment and training to
friendly nations. More than half of this amount
will have been spent by the end of the ﬁscal year
1954. This assistance, combined with their own
resources, enables our allies and friends to equip
and train an equivalent of 175 army divisions
about 220 air force squadrons, nearly 1,500 nava
aircraft, over 440 naval vessels, and related combat
and logistic units to back up these forces.
These friendly forces located in key strategic
areas for the defense of the free world are lar ely
supported by the countries themselves. In a di-
tion, substantial forces are exclusively supported
b our allies. Without all of these forces the
nited States would be faced with a potential
defense burden so costly that it could well sap the
economic vitality of our Nation. These forces
constitute an integral part of the military strength
of the free world.
Since the mutual military program is so closely
integrated with our own military lans and pro-
gram, it is shown this year in the efense chapter
of part II of the budget and is discussed here as
part of our national security program. Because
the mutual military program is also an integral

art of our foreign policy, the Secretary of De-
ense will continue to carry out. his responsibili-
ties for the mutual milita program under the
foreign policy guidance ofrtlie Secretary of State
and within the terms of the mutual security legis-
lation assed by the Congress.
In t is budget, mutual military pro m funds
are shown under the new obligations authority
of the Department of Defense. However, this
arrangement is being reviewed and my recommen-
dations will be set forth in connection with the
authorizing le islation I shall recommend to the
Congress. Tiis authorizing legislation should
permit adjustments in the composition of our aid
programs to meet changing needs due to new in-
ternational developments. It is therefore essen-
tial that the Congress maintain the present Presi-
dential powers of transferability of all foreign
assistance funds, whether for military, technical,
or economic assistance.
The recent Paris meeting of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization set realistic force oals for
the 14 member nations, which will prowde for a.
substantial increase in the defensive stren h of
NATO. The mutual military program provi< es the
bulk of the initial equipment and certain mobiliza-
tion reserves needed to meet these new goals.
Meanwhile, our allies are themselves carrying
heavy burdens. Their military budgets during
the period of this program exceed by many times
the value of the equipment we have so far de-
livered. They have expressed their determination
to continue their efforts at high levels.
Despite the progress which NATO has made, we
are nevertheless faced with a serious need to
achieve the unity in Europe which is necessary for
strength and security in the North Atlantic area.
As is well known, the treaty constituting the Euro-
ean Defense Community is not as yet in effect.
t is not necessary for me to dwell on the reasons
why the E00 is urgently needed. However, I am
convinced that the Europeans who must decide on
this essential next step toward building a Euro-
pean community are fully aware of what is at
