ance of the Carnegie Endowment has sent abroad
about 5,000 students annually. kepresenting di-
rectly some 36 organizations and serving many
others, including universities and religious groups,
it gives information and advice, suggests improve-
ments in itineraries and travel programs, and es-
pecially provides shipboard orientation to pre are
students for living in cultures different from t eir
own.
An appraisal of summer projects made some
time ago by the International Educational Ex-
change Service of the Department of State indi-
cated that most of them are well or anized and
conducted under able and experience leadership.
It was obvious that the participants had beneﬁted
and that they had made a favorable impression on
the people they met overseas.
Appraisals like these reﬂect the interest which
the International Educational Exchange Service
takes in travel projects. Because of their sig-
niﬁcance for international cooperation on a broad,
popular level, this Service works with hundreds
of such sponsoring organizations every year, of-
fering, on request, advice and direction and ar-
ranging where possible for predeparture orienta-
tion and for assistance from the U. S. Information
Service in the countries to be visited by the oups.
In so doing, it is following a time-honore prin-
ciple of encouraging the widest possible develop-
ment of worthwhile exchange projects by private,
nongovernmental groups and organizations, and
of fostering close cooperation between the public
and our Government 1n this ﬁeld.
Educational Exchange Programs
This cooperation is also reﬂected in the edu-
cational exchange rograms ﬁnanced in whole or
In part b our overnment and administered
through t is Service. Under these programs,
private, nonoﬁicial travelers going abroad will
number_about 1,800 people this year. Most of
them Wlll stay abroa for 1 year. Nearly 1,000
will be engaged in advanced study; the remainder
Wlll teach in elementary and secondary schools,
lecture in educational and professional institutions
and before general audiences, undertake profes-
s10nal research, or give specialized assistance to
foreign organizations and a encies. All of them
Will be carefully selected in t e light of the speciﬁc
purposes of their projects and of the fundamental
ur oses of the program as ex ressed in the
miIth-Mundt Act, ’ p
. . . to promote a better understanding of the United
States in other countries, and to increase mutual under‘
standing between the people of the United States and the
people of other countries.
For those persons who go abroad under this
program, advance preparation takes the form of
informational literature and suggested back-
ground readings prepared by the cultural sections
of our posts abroad or by the United States Educa-
tional Foundations or Commissions established
under the Fulbright Act. Such literature includes
not only information on currencies, clothes, cli-
mate, etc., but also summaries of local laws and
customs, hints on differences in ways of life, sug-
gestions regarding local contacts, and other com-
ment which looks beyond immediate professional
pursuits, however important for the program they
may be, to the fundamental goal of international
cooperation and understanding.
Most of the orientation of these persons takes
place after they arrive in the host countries. It
follows plans developed by our missions and foun-
dations. These may vary from individual per-
sonal orientation for certain specialists to system-
atic orientation courses of from 2 to 6 weeks for
groups of students. Such courses include the
study of customs, educational system, and social
institutions of the host countries. In several
countries they include intensive instruction in the
national language as well—for example, those
offered to students in Italy at the Universityl of
Peruggia or in Norway at the Summer Sc 00]
for American Studies at the University of Oslo.
Nor does such orientation cease with z‘introduc-
tory” courses or brieﬁngs. It merges with other
activities and supervision to constitute a year-
round process of counseling, su ervising, guiding,
and facilitating the work of t e grantees under
the program.
By tie very nature of the activities under-
taken, as well as by their relatively long duration,
grantees are brou ht into constant contact with
their occupationa or professional counter arts
and with many others also. An indication 0 how
this works out in personal terms may be seen from
the following example:
An American student in Thailand re orted that
he had visited about 125 different Clinese and
Thai homes. “In most cases, I was the ﬁrst
Westerner, and certainly the ﬁrst American to
have entered their homes. My reception was in
all instances exceptionally friendly. . . . I
would judge that this was one of the few ways
these people had to get the American point of
view.”
For these reasons, among others, their impact
is often pervasive, penetratln , and lasting, es e—
cially among groups which inﬂuence ub ic
opinion. Although a large percenta e 0 these
grantees travel to Europe, more of t em travel
to other areas of the world than do American
travelers generally.
That careful planning, preparation, and ar-
rangements are worthwhile 1s seen by the results.
In general, American grantees return to the
United States with a greatly enriched background
and with an understanding of foreign attitudes
and reactions to American life, motives, and pol-
icies. Our overseas missions report that the
grantees through ability, seriousness, and fair-
ness, leave the impression among the people with
