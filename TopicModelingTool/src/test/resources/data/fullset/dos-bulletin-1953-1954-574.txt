rather to help close it. Our best interest dictates
that the dollar gap be closed by raising the level
of trade and investment.
The United States stands ready and able to
produce and sell more than the rest of the world
can bu from us. The inability of many forei n
countries to buy our goods in the volume we won (1
like to sell does not arise from any lack of desire
for these goods. Such is far from the case. In-
stead it arises out of an inabilit of these nations
tonpay—in dollars—for the v0 ume we have to
se .
Dollar grants are no lasting solution to this
impasse.
The solution is a higher level of two-way trade.
Thus we can sell and receive pa ment for our
exports and have an increasing vo ume of invest-
ment abroad to assist economic development
overseas and yield returns to us. Greater free-
dom from restrictions and controls and the in-
creased efﬁciencies which arise from expanding
markets and the freer play of economic forces are
psseptial to the attainment of this higher trade
eve .
Failure so to move will directly threaten our
domestic economy, for it will doom our efforts to
ﬁnd ways by which others, through their own ef-
forts, can buy our goods. The only practicable al-
ternative is to reduce exports. Our farms would
have to sell less, since the products of 40 million
acres, amounting to 10 to 12 ercent of our agri-
culture, would have to ﬁnd tlieir market outside
our own country. Moreover, if their export mar-
kets were curtailed, American factories now sell-
ing their roducts throughout the world would
have to re uce employment. It is a very im or-
tant fact that over 4 million American wor ers
depend on international trade for their employ-
ment.
Beyond our economic interest, the solidarity
of the free world and the capacity of the free
world to deal with those who would destroy it
are threatened by continued unbalanced :trade
relationships—the inability of nations to sell as
much as they desire to buy. By moving boldly to
correct the present imbalance, we shall support
and increase the level of our exports of both man-
ufactured and agricultural products. \Ve shall,
at the same time, increase the economic strength of
our allies. Thus shall we enhance our own militar
securit by strengthening our friends abroa .
Thus shall we assure those sources of im orts that
supplement our domestic production an are vital
to our defense. Thus shall we raise our standard
of living and aid in the development of a better
world for all of us and our children.

I_ am convinced that the gradual and selective
revision of our tariﬁ's, through the tested method
of negotiation with other nations, is an essential
ingredient of the continuing growth of our do-
mestic economy. An expression of our willing-
ness to negotiate further will offer needed leader-
ship toward the reduction of trade and payments
barriers that limit markets for our goods through-
out the world.
The Commission on Foreign Economic Policy
recommended a three-year extension of the Trade
Agreements Act with amendments to authorize:
a. Reduction, pursuant to trade agreement nego-
tiation, of existing tariﬁ' rates on commodi-
ties selected for such negotiations by not
more than 5 percent of present rates in each
of the 3 years of the new act;
b. Reduction, b not more than one-half over a
3-year peri , of tariﬂ's in effect on Janu-
ary 1, 1945, on products which are not being
imported or which are being imported only
in negligible volume; and
0. Reduction, over a 3-year period, pursuant to
trade agreement negotiation, to 50 percent
ad valorem, or its equivalent, of any rate in
excess of 50 percent ad valorem, or its
equivalent.
I have approved these recommendations of the
Commission and urge their adoption by the Con-
gress. I may also recommend special ro-
visions for negotiation with Japan in view 0 the
economic problems of that country.
The foregoin authority does not contemplate
across-the-boar tariﬁ' reductions. The eril
point and escape clause procedures woul , of
' course, be preserved, and the three proposed types
of rate reduction would not be cumulative. Tariff
reductions would be made selectively on speciﬁc
commodities, and only after notice and hearin
in accordance with past practice. This wou d
represent our part in the gradual and careful a -
proach to the whole problem of improved tra e
which the world so urgently needs. No sudden,
sharp, or widespread ad 'ustments within our econ-
omy would be involve .
These escape clause and peril point provisions
of our tariﬂ' legislation are designed to mitigate
injury to our domestic producers from tariff re-
ductions. Whenever recourse is had to these pro-
visions, I shall carefully consider the ﬁndings and
recommendations of the Tariff Commission. My
responsibilities for the welfare of the Nation re
quire that I continue to base my decisions at times
on broader grounds than the Tariff Commission
is empowered to consider. The Commission on
Foreign Economic Policy supports this position.
I have approved the Commission’s recommen-
dations that the United States withhold reductions
in tariffs on products made by workers receiving
wages which are substandard in the exporting
country. This policy shall be placed in effect. I
have also approved the Commission’s recommen-
dations concerning raising of labor standards
