Remarks of Dr. Spekke
I have the honor to present to you the Letters
of Mr. Charles Zarine, Latvian Minister in Lon-
don, and bearer of the Special Emergency Powers
of the last Legal Government of Latvia, accredit-
ing me to you as Chargé d’Atfaires of Latvia in the
United States.
It is a great honor and pleasure for me to repre-
sent the Independent Republic of Latvia in this
great country, the United States of America. I
have come to the United States with a sincere
desire and a ﬁrm determination to continue the
work of my predecessor, the late Minister Jules
Feldmans, who was devoted to the task of bringing
closer to the American Nation the problems of the
people of Latvia, who are presently subjugated
by the Soviet Union.
Before assuming my duties in Washington, at
this trying and difﬁcult time in the long history
of the Latvian people, I wish to express to Your
Excellency, to the Government, and to the people
of the United States of America my undying
gratitude for their moral support and for the
traditionally unswerving stand of the United
States in favor of the rights of the oppressed na-
tions, which has become a beacon of light and a
source of strength and inspiration to mankind.
Mr. Secretary, I beg you to accept the sincere
good wishes that Mr. Zarine, bearer of the Latvian
State emergency powers, expresses through me, to
which I join my own best wishes, for Your Excel-
lency’s personal happiness. I also wish to express
to you on this occasion our hope for the preserva-
tion of our Christian civilization and the mainte-
nance of the dignity of free men and all peoples of
good will.
Remarks of Secretary Dulles
I have received from your hands the letters of
April 21, 1954, in which Mr. Charles Zarine, Min-
ister of Latvia in London and bearer of the
special emergency power of the last independent
Government of the Republic of Latvia, presents
{pu to me as Chargé d’Aﬂ'aires of Latvia in the
nited States. You come in succession to the late
Mr. Jules Feldmans whose distinguished and
devoted services in representing his country to
the United States were cut short by his untimely
death last year.
In accepting you as Chief of the Latvian Mis-
sion in Washington in the capacity of Chargé
d’Aﬁ'aires, this Government reafﬁrms its whole-
hearted support for the Republic of Latvia and
for the realization of the principle, expressed in
the Atlantic Charter that sovereign rights and
self-government shall be restored to those who
have been forcibly deprived of them.
I am conﬁdent that in carrying on the work to
which your redecessors gave themselves unspar-
ingly in defianse of the cause of a free Latvia,
you will enjoy, as they did the dedicated support
of Latvians everywhere. I am happy to welcome
you to this country and to wish you every success
in undertaking your duties here. You may be
assured that my associates in the Department and
I will always be ready to help you in every way we
can.
I would ask you to thank Minister Zarine for
his expression of good wishes, which are warmly
reciprocated, on behalf of the Latvian nation and
himself for the welfare and prosperity of the
United States.
