The United States, for its part, has no imperial-
istic designs; it seeks no special advantages for
its citizens. Since 1945 we have been devoting
stupendous sums to help rebuild man of the war-
ravaged countries of Europe an Asia. We
offered this aid to all countries in Europe. But
for mischievous misrepresentations of our motives
and a contrived climate of opinion hostile to our
national purposes, we might today have been
furnishing to the peoples of the Soviet Union and
to China many of the implements of peaceful de-
velo ment of which those vast countries stand so
muc in need.
Should this Conference fail, it will be said that
international meetings of this scope are held
merely for purposes of propaganda, not really to
negotiate agreements or eace. As the United
States re resentative the ecretary of State came
here, an I succeeded him here, to help negotiate
an honorable peace on such terms as Wlll promote
freedom throughout the world.
Let me make it clear, as President Eisenhower
has said: We are not attempting to tell other peo-
les what form of government they shall choose.
e are asking, in association with our friends and
allies, that no governmental ower shall be exer-
cised to threaten the eace ofp the world. We are
convinced there will no war in the world if the
people themselves have the ﬁnal word.
We stand prepared to pledge our resources to
the constructive urposes of peace. \Ve shall be
compelled to bu1 d more alliances for defensive
security only7 if there is a continuing menace to
our nationa safety and to the safety of all the
nations whose interests are bound together with
ours in common objectives of peace and freedom.
These concepts have special relevance here in
Geneva, where the League of Nations began its
existence more than 3 decades ago, based upon the
premise that a threat to eace in one area can
disturb the peace of the w iole world. That con-
cept was realistically reafﬁrmed and acce ted at
San Francisco in 1945, when the United ations
was organized. That immense difﬁculties lie
ahead of us is apparent to all. But our goals
are clear.
We are here to establish a united, free, demo-
cratic, independent Korea. We are here to assist,
if we can, in the establishment of a durable, secure
peace for the Associated States of Viet-Nam,
Laos, and Cambodia. We are here to uphold the
authority of the United Nations to resist aggres-
sion. We are here to prevent the spread of com-
munism in Southeast Asia. We are here to bring
closer together the free nations of the world.
A will to negotiate in good faith and to keep
engagements once undertaken—these are the
essentials of a successful conference. On our side
we are prepared to do both, within the framework
of the principles of freedom that lie at the heart
of the traditions of our world.
Fall of Dien-Bien-Phu
Message From President Eisenhower to
Prosldont Coty
White House press release dated May 1
The follmviln; message gram President Eisen-
hower to Pre ' ent René at of France was de-
livered on May 7' by U.S. Am aesador 0. Douglas
Dillon:
MY DEAR PRESIDENT Corr : The entire free world
has been inspired by the heroism and stamina dis-
played by the gallant garrison at Dien Bien Phu.
‘heir devotion and the quality of their resistance
have been so great that that battle will forever
stand as a symbol of the free world’s determina-
tion to resist dictatorial aggression and to sustain
its right of self-determination and its dedication
to the dignity of the human being. France has
in the past suffered tem orary defeats, but always
she has triumphed in t 1e end to continue as one
of the world’s leaders in all things that tend to
bring greater richness to the lives of men. Those
who fought and died and suffered at Dien Bien
Phu should know that no sacriﬁce of theirs has
been in vain; that the free world will remain faith-
ful to the causes for which they have so nobly
fought.

Message to Ban Dal
White Home press release dated May 7
T he following message mm the President to
Bao Dai Chief of State ({ Via-Nam, was trans-
mitted through the U.S. 'mbassy at Paris:
Yooa Mans'rr,
On behalf of the American people I should like to
express to you and the people of Viet-Nam our
admiration for the gallant men of the Vietnamese
forces who, together with their comrades of the
French Union, for two months so heroically de-
fended Dien Bien Phu against insuperable odds.
It is sad indeed that the fortress and its brave
defenders have fallen to the enemy, but we can be
heartened in the knowledge that their sacriﬁce
has not been in vain. Not only have they taken a
terrible toll of the enemy, but, I think more im-
portant, their heroic resistance to the evil forces of
Communist aggression has given inspiration to all
who support the cause of human freedom. Those
brave men made their sacriﬁce in order that indi-
vidual freedom and national independence for the
people of Viet-Nam should not be lost to Commu-
nist enslavement. YVe of the free world are deter-
mined to remain faithful to the causes for which
they have so nobly fought.
\Vith expressions of my personal regard,
Dwum'r D. EISENIIOWER
