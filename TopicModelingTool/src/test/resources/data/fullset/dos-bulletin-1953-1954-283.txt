of its major export products were raw silk and
cotton textiles. But exports of raw silk are now
sharply reduced because of the competition en-
countered from s nthetic ﬁbers, and the sales of
cotton textiles, alt ough substantial, have declined
because many countries, such as India and Paki-
stan, which formerly were substantial markets,
have developed cotton textile industries of their
own. In consequence, Japan must alter the pat-
tern of its export trade, placing more emphasis
on the products of heavy industry, including steel,
ships, machinery and equipment of all kinds, ce-
ment, and chemical fertilizer. Yet, in the mar-
keting abroad of many of these products, Japan
has had little experience, and, for a number of
them, its prices are not competitive With similar
articles roduced in Western Europe and the
United tates.
As a result of these conditions, Japan’s foreign
sales have not kept pace with import requirements.
In 1952 its imports exceeded its exports by $756
million. In 1953 exports remained relatively
steady at about $1,200 million, but imports _in-
creased to $2,300 million; in consequence, the 1m-
port balance for last year rose to $1,100 million.
Japan could not afford such excesses in pur-
chases abroad if it did not earn additional dollars
from special sources, dollars received in exchange
for goods and services urchased on behalf of
United States forces. T e United States extends
no economic aid to Japan in the form of grants.
It does purchase some of the supplies it requires
from Japanese sources; it awards contracts for
services, includin the repair of its vehicles and
equipment, and t us it employs J a anese labor.
In addition, individual members 0 the Armed
Forces make personal expenditures on their own
behalf which recently have amounted, in the ag-
gregate, to the astounding sum of $1 million a day.
In effect, special dollar receipts are the equivalent
of additional exports plus a very substantial tour-
ist trade. In the last 2 years they totaled more
than $800 million annuall .
In 1952 these special dhllars were sufﬁcient to
oﬁset J apan’s import balance. In 1953 they were
not, and Japan will lose at least $200 millions or
20 percent of its foreign currency reserves. Cb-
viousl this trend cannot long continue. Yet in
1954 apan appears likely again to have an ad-
verse position in its balance of payments, unless
exports are expanded or imports curtailed; and
the reduction of imports will be diﬁicult because
of the necessity to import increased quantities of
food to offset the diminished supply of rice.
Japan’s Importance as a World Market
These are facts which cannot be denied, or
ignored. Another fact is that Japan is a large
and signiﬁcant world market. Imports valued
at $2,300 million cannot be overlooked. Japan is
an important market for the United States; it is
our largest urchaser of raw cotton, wheat, and
rice to mention only a few of the most signiﬁcant
commodities. It is important to Canada as a
buyer of wheat, to Australia for wool, and to the
Philippines for iron ore, other minerals salt,
abaca, timber, and lumber. Indeed, it 18 my
opinion that many products of the Philippines
could ﬁnd a ready and expanding market in Ja-
pan, including perhaps, i produced in sufﬁcient
quantities and at competitive prices, rice and
su ar.
et us look for a moment at the trade of Japan
with some of its important suppliers. The United
States sells to Ja an products valued at about
$750 million and u s $250 million. Of course,
currently, special dollar receipts more than offset
this imbalance in trade, but it cannot be antici-
pated that such receipts will be a permanent part
of Japanese economy. Instead they constitute a
temporary, although most helpful, windfall.
Canadian sales to Japan amount to about $100
million and purchases to $18 million. Australian
sales will approximate $116 million and‘purchases
$4 million. The Philippines sells products valued
at about $47 million and buys $18 million. In
view of these trade data, it seems pertinent to sug-
gest that, if we wish to continue to sell, we must
also buy.
I would even go further and propose, for our
mutual consideration, that economic stability and
well-being in the Paciﬁc cannot be assured unless
Japan is a participant. If Japan cannot pur-
chase the raw materials it requires, the cotton
farmers in the United States will suffer; so will
the wool growers of Australia, the wheat pro-
ducers of Canada, and the miners in the Philip-
pines. I submit that a prosperous Japan Will
contribute to our own prosperity.
To achieve this goal, there are many things
which Ja an must do for itself, thin , in fact,
which (mi; Japan can do. These mi possibly
include an increase in the efﬁciency 0 its produc-
tion to insure a reduction in costs so that its prod-
ucts may become competitive and ﬁrm adherence
to sound ﬁscal, ﬁnancial, and trade policies and
practices. But beyond these things, there are mat-
ters over which Japan has no control, for example,
the failure to receive most-favored-nation treat-
ment for its products in some foreign markets and
the maintenance abroad of excessive tariﬁ barriers
on roducts which it desires to export. In our own
sel -interest, to assure the maintenance of our ex-
port volume, it seems necessary that Japan be
given an opportunity to develop a balanced for-
eign trade. No one nation alone can provide the
solution, even if it should be willing to try. In~
stead, the problem would seem to require the co-
operation of all the nations of the free world, es-
pecially those with a major interest in economic
stability in the Paciﬁc.
And speaking of cooperation, Japan, although
it is not yet a member of the United Nations, is
