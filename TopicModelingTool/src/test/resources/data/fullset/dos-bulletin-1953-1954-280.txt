That is no Ion er the case. And in saying this
I do not mean that the emergency is necessarily
less, or that the threat of Communist imperialism
has decreased. Rather it is that our standing
capacity to deal with such contingencies as may
develop has greatly improved.
Likewise, we, as a nation, ﬁnd that the economic
aid which in the past was essential to the contin-
uance of the coalition of free countries can be con-
ﬁned to special and temporary situations.

In addition, I should note another development.
I mentioned earlier that our actions were of the
emergenc nature, taken in response to Soviet
moves. here has been a change here, as well—a
basic change. The initiative has now passed from
the Kremlin to the free nations. This is a shift
of eat importance.
I'grrom the outset, one objective of the policy fol-
lowed by the free community has been security.
Such forces as have been raised are security
forces—that is, the are intended solely for defen-
sive use. Althoug the Soviet Union, in its prop-
aganda, has tried to depict the European Army,
for example, as an aggressive force, t e facts are
that it is iterally impossible to use it as such.
This army and the North Atlantic community
under which it is organized, like other a plications
of the principle of collective security, unction as
deterrents. And in case of a future attack, they
are a defense-in-being. However, in lanning
polic for the future, emphasis has been s ifted to
the eterrent factor.
On-the-spot defense, everywhere, in strength
sufficient to deal with any eventuality would over-
tax the capacity of the free community. Local
defenses there must be, and the are vital but
their value as a deterrent can on y be brought to
the needed level if they are reinforced with an
overall retaliatory power which is decisive.
The signiﬁcance of this approach should not be
underestimated. No longer can a would-be ag-
gressor spread his maps in front of him and select
the theater, the type and the scope of the action.
He can no longer calculate his risk. This is so
because the free communit is now placed to re-
ply—not as the aggressor ictates—but at a time,
and a lace, and in a fashion of its own choosing.
We be ieve that this should effectively discourage
an aggressor.
In a manner of speaking, we are still ready to
ﬁght such ﬁres as may break out, but we are de-
voting more energy to ﬁre revention.
It is perhaps easiest to folllow the application of
this approach in the Far East. At the conclusion
of the truce, the members of the United Nations
Command served notice on the Chinese Commu-
nists that if they broke the truce and renewed their
aggression, it might not be possible to limit hos-
tiiities to the Korean Peninsula. The Peiping re-
gime was also advised that aggressive intervention
in Indochina would “have grave con uences
which might not be conﬁned to Indochina.’
In so stating, we were not rattling the sabre.
We were not making threats. We simply an-
nounced what would be aired of us if the Com-
munists persisted in their attempt to conquer
southeast Asia. We also felt it important that the
Red strategists be fully apprised of our intentions
so that these intentions could enter into their cal-
culations. We have reason to think that the Com-
munists would not have attacked the Republic of
Korea if the had foreseen large-scale resistance.
Another such miscalculation could be even more
tragic. We are determined to do our part to
prevent it.
I believe that we can safely assume that this
policy has had its effect on Red China’s attitude
toward its nei hbors to the southeast. Such moves
as they may ave had under consideration must
now be reexamined.
The may have felt that the Korean aggression
brougit the Communist cause an advantage be-
cause it tied down substantial elements of the free
world’s military forces where the situation was
tactically adverse. If that used to be so it certainly
is not so now. We have no intention of tying
down our forces in Korea, as the recently an-
nounced plan to withdraw troops from the penin-
sula demonstrates. Yet this withdrawal plan can
in no way be interpreted as a weakenin of our
determination to rotect the integrity 0 the Re-
ublic of Korea. t is simply evidence that ﬂexi-
bility has been restored to our position in the
Paciﬁc.
My remarks so far may seem to deal preponder-
antly with military policy and military strength.
Perhaps that is because military power and mili-
tary policly ﬁgure importantly in a modern forei
Rolicy. his will continue to be so as long as t e
remlin laces such great emphasis on strength.
It is futi e to negotiate with the Soviet Union
unless you have strength suil'icient to command
res t.
here is a story which you may have heard
before which illustrates this. An underling is
reputed to have informed Stalin of the Vatican’s
opposition to a certain Soviet move. Stalin is
supposed to have shru ged and asked: “The Pope ?
How man divisions ias he got?”
thile that conversation may never have taken
place, it describes the Kremlin’s attitude.
For example, the improvement in the military
position of the free nations contributed to the
signing of an honorable truce in Korea. It is also
a factor in our successful insistence on the prin-
ciple of nonforcible repatriation of prisoners of
war. And if we succeed in convening a political
conference to discuss the establishment of a uniﬁed
and independent Korea—in some part we can
thank the power that we have sacriﬁced so much
to create.
