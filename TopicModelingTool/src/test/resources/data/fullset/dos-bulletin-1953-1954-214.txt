tare—such as the reduction of armaments, includ-
ing the problem of atomic weapons and also the
problem of removing trade barriers so that the
800 million people subject to Mr. Molotov’s type
of Communist rule Wlll no longer be im over-
ished because they can draw on the vastly igher
standards of living which prevail in the non-Com-
munist world.
I took occasion this morning to look over the
Charter of the United Nations. I saw that article
11 ives the General Assembly responsibility to
ma e proposals with reference to disarmament
and the re lation of armaments.” I saw that
article 13 gives the General Assembly the res on-
sibility to make pro osals with reference to ‘ pro-
moting internationa coo ration in the economic
ﬁeld.” I saw that artic e 14 gives the General
Assembly the right to propose a “peaceful ad'ust-
ment of anyK situation, regardless of origin, w ich
it deems li ely to impair the general welfare or
friendly relations among nations.”
I saw that article 26 ives the Security Council
the prima responsibility to develop plans “for
the establis ment of a system for the regulation
of armaments,” and that articles 33 to 51 give the
Security Council primary res onsibility to deal
with the paciﬁc settlement of isputes and to take
action with respect to threats to the peace, breaches
of the peace, and acts of a gression. I saw that
articles 61 and 62 establiSied an economic and
social council to make recommendations with
respect to international economic matters.

I saw that article 99 gave the Secretary General
the authority to “bring to the attention of the
Security Council any matter which may
threaten the maintenance of international eace
and security.” When I thus compared the nited
Nations Charter with Mr. Molotov’s speech, I saw
that in effect he proposed that the Council of the
so-called “ﬁve great owers” should in eﬂ'ect su-
persede the United ations.
Mr. Molotov attempted to meet my earlier state-
ment that his pro osal had this effect b pointin
out that the P0 am agreement crea a Counci
of Foreign Ministers even after the United Na-
tions Charter had been adopted. But this analogy
is not applicable. The Council of Foreign Min-
isters established under the Potsdam agreement
was established ursuant to the provisions of arti-
cle 107 of the C arter which expressly authorized
the Allied powers to conclude the peace settle-
ment. That was the limited purpose of the Pots-
dam Council. Mr. Molotov‘s present proposal for
a council does not fall within the exception pro-
vided for by article 107 of the Charter.
It is obvious that the “ﬁve-power conference”
proposed by Mr. Molotov could not be a confer-
ence of temporary duration. It would be incredi-
ble that the four of us, even with the addition of
the fabulous Mr. Chou En-lai, would be able
quickly to solve the political, economic, and mili-
tary problems with which the United Nations has
wrestled unsuccessfully for the past 9 ears. The
task roposed for the conference by 191 r. Molotov
woul inevitably turn that conference into a per-
manent body With a vast network of subcommit-
tees and experts. This would in effect replace the
United Nations.
Mr. Molotov scarcely disguises the fact that
this is what he has in mind. He has said that, be-
cause the United Nations does not accept the cre-
dentials of the Communist regime of China, there-
fore the United Nations should be bypassed and
its responsibilities must be taken over by a new
world organization which would be an assumption
by the ﬁve so-called “great powers” of the responsi-
bility and authority to rule the world with refer-
ence to political, armament, and economic matters.
In other words, because the United Nations has
refused to admit into its councils a roclaimed
aggressor, Mr. Molotov contends the nited Na-
tions must be penalized by having its responsibili-
ties transferred to the aggressor.
Mr. Molotov has entertained us by an exhibition
of his abilit to make the preposterous seem
plausible. Hlowever, we did not come here for
entertainment. We came here in the hopes of
doing some serious business.
My feeling is that we have had an adequate
“ﬁrst round” exchange of views on this sublect—
the ﬁrst item on our agenda—and that Without
forgetting what has been said we now move on to
an exchange of views re arding the two other
agenda items relating to ermany and Austria.
STATEMENT OF FEBRUARY 2
Press release 50 dated February 3
Yesterday, Mr. Molotov delivered himself of a
major polemic. Apparently, he felt that we had
left far behind us the ﬁrst agenda item. That item
dealt with the relaxing of international tensions.
But, since we were on the second agenda item, Mr.
Molotov felt moved to intensify international ten-
sions, so he made bitter accusations against
France, the United Kingdom, and the United
States. He charged us with conspiring to start
a new world war with the help of revived German
militarism.
If it is desirable to relax international tensions,
and I think it is, I wonder whether it is not desir-
able for us to seek this all the time, and not merely
as item 1 of an agenda.
I have said that I was prepared to assume, at
least for the purpose of this meeting, that the
Soviet Union honestly wants ce.
