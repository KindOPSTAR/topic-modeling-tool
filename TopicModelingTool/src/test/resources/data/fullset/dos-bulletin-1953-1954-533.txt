toward unity, there seems little prospect that
Europe can ever regain a full measure of economic
and political stability. \Vithout understanding
and cooperation between France and Germany,
Western Europe will remain a powder keg of
potential strife and conﬂict.
There are no good alternatives to E00, and it is
impossible to predict what the results of a re-
appraisal of our policies might be. Europe is so
important to our own security that we must try to
avoid any course of action which might leave
Euro e vulnerable to Soviet imperialism. On the
other nand, the American Con res and the Ameri-
can people cannot be expecte to support policies
and programs that have no chance of success.
Even a feeble alternative may prove to be better
than endless indecision. However, we still believe
that the European nations directly concerned will
recognize the advantages afforded by the E00 and
will soon bring it to fruition. At present, our
plans are being developed on this assumption.
Another major problem that concerns us today
is the relationship of Euro e to the worldwide
struggle for freedom. Presi ent Eisenhower and
Secretary Dulles have placed special emphasis on
the need for a global approach to foreign policy.
Neither Western Europe nor the Atlantic area as
a whole can be viewed in isolation. This does not
mean less emphasis on Europe in American think-
ing, but rather a greater attention to the intimate
interrelation between the problems of Europe and
those of Africa and Asia. Just as the con uest of
Europe would open Asia, Africa, and the iddle
East to Soviet enetration, so would Communist
domination of t e East strike a powerful blow at
the security and stability of free Europe. This
roblem is a tly illustrated by the situation in
ndochina, w ere France is making painful sac-
riﬁces to check Communist aggression. It is vital
that our policies toward France be considered in
terms of probable effects in Indochina and South-
east Asia as a whole, and it is also necessary that
our olicies toward Southeast Asia take account
of rench interests and capabilities. In the face
of global Soviet expansionism, we must have a
glo a1 resistance founded on global thinking.
One important aspect of this global roblem
is the situation of astern Europe. ile the
people of Eastern German , Poland, Czechoslova-
ia, Bulgaria, Rumania, ungary, and the Baltic
States remain in enslavement, it is almost impos-
sible to foresee a really stable Europe. We cannot
accept this enslavement as a permanent fact, not
only because Soviet domination of these areas
feeds Russian power and threatens our own secu-
rit , but also because of the moral rinci les in-
vo ved. I want to make it very c ear t at the
United States Government does not contemplate
an attempt to liberate these areas by war. At the
same time, we will exert the utmost effort to create
the conditions by which these nations can regain
their independence and become peaceful and pro-
ductive members of the community of free nations.
Maintaining U.S.-European Friendship
The ﬁnal problem which I want to mention to-
day is so obvious that it is sometime overlooked.
I refer to the problem of maintaining friendship
and respect between the United States and its
European allies. In the ﬁnal analysis, diplomacy
involves a great deal more than agreements on
military, political, and economic measures. To
a large extent, it is the business of maintaining
friendship. None of the objectives of our foreign
olicy can be realized if we fail to win and keep
friends for the United States.
All of us have heard in this country a great deal
of criticism of our European allies. Some of this
criticism is reasonable, but much of it is greatly
exaggerated. At the same time, we cannot shut
our eyes to the fact that there exists in Europe,
even among peo le basically friendly to the United
States, serious ears of United States ower, criti-
cisms of United States practices, an suspicions
of United States intentions.
I believe there is little immediate danger that
the peoples of free Europe and America will be-
come enemies. However, if we are to pursue oli-
cies aimed at long-range ob'ectives, we must eep
in mind the problems whic may arise in a long
period of years. It is no secret that the creation
of division among the nations of the free world
is one of the princi al objectives of Soviet policy.
The Soviet leaders believe that the best chance for
the triumph of communism lies in splitting up the
free nations and making them waste their energies
in political and economic struggles among them-
selves.
Diﬁerences among friendly nations are inevi-
table. I see no great danger in mutual criticism,
so long as mutual criticism is ke t within the
bounds of reason and so long as t e peoples of
America and free Europe remember that their
common interests are much more important than
any differences which may arise. We Americans,
for example, must learn to think of our defenses
not solely in terms of our own Arm , Navy, and
Air Force, but in terms of the combined milita
forces available to ourselves and our allies. l e
need to think of the threat to our security not
merely as a threat to New York, Chicago, or San
Francisco, but also as a threat to London, Paris,
and Berlin. \Ve need to develop our economic
olicies in terms of their effects on the economic
liealth of our allies, as well as their effect upon
American farms and industries. By developing
the attitudes of true partnership and encouraging
the European nations to do the same, I am con-
vinced that we can create a system of strength and
well-being which will preserve peace and protect
our liberties for many years to come.
