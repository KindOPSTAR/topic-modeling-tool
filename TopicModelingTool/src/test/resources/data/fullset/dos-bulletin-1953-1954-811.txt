This agreement, similar to others concluded
with countries already receiving U.S. militar as-
sistance, contains the customary provision or a
U.S. Military Advisory Group, plus assurances on
the part of the recipient country that it will not
use such aid for aggressive purposes.
Pakistan’s resolve to lay an important part in
the collective defense 0? the free world has been
clearly demonstrated by its recent Friendship Pact
with Turkey, in which the two countries have
agreed to study the methods of achieving closer
collaboration in the political, economic, and cul-
tural spheres, including means designed toward
igrengt ening peace and security in the Middle
ast.
The Government of the United States and the
Government of Pakistan have by an exchange of
notes set forth their mutual understanding that
the provisions of the Mutual Defense Assistance
Agreement signed by the Governments of the
United States and Pakistan do not establish a
military alliance between the two Governments
nor do they involve any obligation on the part of
Pakistan to provide military bases for the use of
the United States.
Military Assistance Agreement
With Honduras
Press release 269 dated May 21
The Departments of State and Defense an-
nounce the signing, in Tegucigalpa on May 20, of
a bilateral military-assistance agreement between
the United States and Honduras.
This agreement is consistent with, and conforms
to, inter-American instruments already in effect
such as the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocai
Assistance (the Rio Treaty), the resolution on
Inter-American Military Coo eration a proved at
the Washington Meeting of oreign ii inisters of
1951, and the continuous planning of the Inter-
American Defense Board.
The agreement is the tenth of its kind to be
signed between the United States and one of the
other American Republics. Similar agreements,
involving the provision of military grant aid by
the United States to promote the defense of the
Western Hemisphere, have been signed with Ec-
uador, Peru, Cuba, Brazil, Chile, Colombia,
Uruguay, the Dominican Republic, and Nicaragua.
These agreements were initiated under the pro-
gram of military grant aid for Latin America,
authorized in the Mutual Security Act of 1951.
They illustrate the spirit of cooperation prevailing
among the American Republics which makes it
possible for them to concentrate, through self-help
and mutual aid, upon increasing their ability to
contribute to the collective defense of the Western
Hemisphere.
Proposed Extension of Tax
Convention With Netherlands
Press release 273 dated May 22
The Government of the Netherlands has pro-
posed to the U.S. Government that the operation
of the income tax convention of 1948 between the
two countries be extended to the Netherlands
Antilles.
The convention between the United States and
the Netherlands for the avoidance of double taxa-
tion and the prevention of ﬁscal evasion with re-
spect to taxes on income and certain other taxes
was signed at Washington on April 29, 1948, and
was brought into force by the exchange of instru—
ments of ratiﬁcation on December 1, 1948. The
U.S. Senate had previously given its advice and
consent to ratiﬁcation, subject to certain reserva-
tions, the texts of which are set forth in the Presi-
dent’s proclamation of the convention (Treaties
and Other International Acts Series 1855; 62
Stat, pt. 2, 1757).
Article XXVII of the convention contains pro-
visions relating to the procedure whereby the ap-
plication of the convention may be extended, in
whole or in part, to overseas areas under the juris-
diction of either government. Pursuant to those
provisions, the Government of the Netherlands
has given written notiﬁcation of the desire of the
Government of the Netherlands Antilles that the
operation of the convention be extended thereto.
Before the proposed extension can be accepted
by this Government, in accordance with the pro-
cedures stipulated in Article XXVII (2) of the
convention, it will be necessary to communicate the
Netherlands proposal to the U.S. Senate for its
approval.
The Department of the Treasury would welcome
such comments and suggestions as interested per-
sons may wish to make in regard to the proposed
extension. Such comments and suggestions should
be submitted to the Ofﬁce of the Secretary of the
Treasury, if possible by June 8.
