The Development of United States Policy in the Near East,
South Asia, and Africa During 1953: Part I‘
by Harry N. Howard
I. SOME OLD PROBLEMS IN A NEW SETTING
Basic Problems and Considerations
During the course of the ear 1953 the United
States continued to be con onted with difﬁcult
and complicated problems in the vast area of the
Near East, South Asia, and Africa. As in the
past, whether directly or within the framework
of the United Nations, the problems have ranged
from broad and fundamental issues—such as the
emergent nationalism of the peoples of this area,
with their urge toward self-determination, self-
government or independence; the economic de-
velopment of underdeveloped territories; and
uestions of mutual security and assistance—to
t e special problems involved in North Africa,
Anglo-Egyptian and Anglo-Iranian differences,
the persistent Israeli-Arab controversies, the ques-
tion of Kashmir, and a host of others. In one
way or another, the peoples and states of this art
of the world continued to be under ressure rom
the Soviet Union; the assing of remier Stalin
and the emergence of remier Malenkov failed
to alter the picture in any basic sense, whatever
the change in tactics, as indicated in the Malenkov
statement of August 8, 1953.
Although President Eisenhower made no spe-
ciﬁc reference to problems arising from the Near

East, South Asia, and Africa in his inaugural ad-
dress of January 20, 1953, he did state: '
Conceiving the defense of freedom like freedom itself
to be one and indivisible, we hold all continents and
peoples in equal regard and honor. We reject any in-
sinuation that one race or another, one people or another,
is in any sense interior or expendable.
There was a similar note in the State of the
Union Address of February 2 in which the Presi-
dent declared that “the policy we embrace must be
a coherent global policy. The freedom we cherish
and defend in Euro e and in the Americas is no
different from the reedom that is im eriled in
Asia.“ Dedicated to the security 0 the free
world, the policy of the United States would “en-
vision all peaceful methods and devices—exec t
breakin faith with our friends.” Nor would t 0
United tates “acquiesce in the enslavement of any
people in order to purchase fancied gain for
ourselves.”
In his ﬁrst report to the American people on for-
eign policy problems, on January 27,‘ Secretary
Dulles touched on the Near East, South Asia, and
Africa, pointing out the great strategic and eco-
nomic signiﬁcance of the area and the troublesome
issues which had come to the American doorstep
and laying stress on the Soviet and Communist
threat.
There were other indications of the American
concern, especially with the basic problems in the
Near and Middle East. \Vhen Prince Faisal, the
Foreign Minister of Saudi Arabia, called on Presi-
dent Eisenhower on March 2,” the President not
