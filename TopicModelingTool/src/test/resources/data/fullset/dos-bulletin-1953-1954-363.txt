ation between the private investors of the United
States and those in Canada. Approximately 5
billion dollars of private United States capital
have been invested in Canada and have made a
signiﬁcant contribution to producing for Canada
one of the highest standards of living in the world.
We can see here in our host country the results
of international cooperation. No one who has
5 ent even a few days in this eat and growing
city can fail to be impressed y the atmosphere
of creative vitality. I am told that nearly 2 bil-
lion dollars of private foreign capital have come
to Venezuela on a mutually advantageous basis.
The results are open for anyone to see. There
are other countries into which substantial United
States capital has also ﬂowed. The total of United
States private direct investments in Latin Amer-
ica amounts, I believe, to about 6 billion dollars.
This is a large ﬁgure, particularly when it is borne
in mind that domestic capital always provides the
greater part of any country’s ﬁnancin . Indeed,
understand that over 90 percent of t e total in-
vestment undertaken in Latin America is now de-
rived from domestic sources, a happy augury of the
growing strength of this great area.
Some countries have seen ﬁt to put artiﬁcial
obstacles in the way of what would be the normal
and natural ﬂow of capital between hi hly de-
veloped and less developed countries. hat is,
of course, their privilege. In these matters every
nation is soverel .
The United tates Government has not the
slightest desire or intention to extort for its
8370 opportunities which are not freely accor ed.
e would, however, like to see the economies of
our American friends and neighbors more vi or-
ous than in some cases they are. We would ike
to see living standards raised, employment in-
creased, and wages such as to provide the workers
with greater rewards. For these reasons we hope
that no country will impose restrictions which un-
necessaril inhibit cooperation for development.
In the {Inited States private capital and free
enterprise constitute the great source of our own
economic well-being. That is a source which we
do not try to keep at home. It is free to go abroad,
and we welcome its international activ1ties. In-
deed, President Eisenhower in his recent Budget
Message to the Congress recommended certain
modiﬁcations in our tax laws which will encour-
age our capital and business people to work abroad.
However, private capital cannot be driven. It
has to be attracted. Therefore, the decision rests
with you.
1'"! EXPORT-IMPORT BANK
5. There are some development projects which
may not be suitable for or attractive to private
capital, domestic or foreign. The International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which
most of us here participated in establishing and to
which the United States has made important
capital contributions, is the primary instrument
through which the free world can cooperate in the
public ﬁnancing of economic development.
We have also in the United States in the public
ﬁnancing ﬁeld the Export-1m ort Bank, a. na-
tional institution of my own overnment. One
important function of this institution will con-
tinue to be that of affording export credits either
through direct loans or arantees.
There has been specu ation as to whether this
bank has withdrawn from the ﬁeld of economic
development. I am glad to be able to clarify this
matter. The Export-Import Bank will consider
on their merits applications for the ﬁnancing of
development projects which are not being made by
the International Bank and which are in our com-
mon interest, are economically sound, are within
the capacity of the prospective borrower to repay
Endkwithin the prudent loaning capacity of the
an .
Splrltual Unity
I have spoken of political and economic matters.
Let me in conclusion speak of what is most im-
portant of all, that is, understanding and cooper-
ation in s iritual and cultural matters.
It has een my happy experience to have been
associated many times with the representatives of
the Latin American countries at such gatherings
as the Assembly of the United Nations. Also I
recall atefully the cooperation of the American
Repub ics at the two San Francisco Conferences—
that of 1945, which drafted the United Nations
Charter, and that of 1951, which concluded the
Japanese peace treaty.
The unity which generally revails between us
at international gatherings 1s nothing that is
artiﬁcial. It is not, indeed, primarily geographic.
It is a unity which exists because ofna harmony of
the spirit. "'-—-" C I
It has been my experience that the Governments
of the American Republics usually act alike inter-
nationally because their peoples believe in the
same fundamentals.
We believe in a spiritual world; we believe that
man has his origin and destiny in God; we believe
that this fact requires human brotherhood.
We believe that, just as every human being has
dignity and worth, so every nation great or small
has di it and worth and that international rela-
tions s on d be on the basis of mutual respect and
equal di , ity.
We be ieve that nations, like men, are subject to
moral law and that in the international ﬁeld the
task is to develop international law and to con-
duct international affairs in accordance with the
standards of moral law.
That is the conception of my Government. I
believe that it is a conception which the nations
here generally share. Of course we are all fallible.
