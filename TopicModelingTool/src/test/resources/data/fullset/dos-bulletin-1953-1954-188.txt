Foreign Economic Policy. The Commission, as you know,
was set up, at my request, by the Congress to study and
report on the over-all foreign economic policy of this
country.
I am anxious that Executive Departments and Agencies
with responsibilities in the area of foreign economic
policy proceed immediately with an intensive review of
this report as a ﬁrst step in the formulation of a uniﬁed
Administration program to be submitted to the Congress
for its attention during the current session.
I am conﬁdent that, on the basis of the Report, it will
be possible to develop a program that will advance the best
interests both of the United States and of the free world.

President's Views on
Treaty Making
Following is the test of a letter dated January
25 from President Eisenhower to Senate Majority
Leader William F. Knowland setting forth the
President’s views with. respect to the treatymak-
ing functions of the Federal Government: ’
In response to your inquiry, I give the following
as my attitude toward the proposal for amending
the treaty-making functions of the Federal Gov-
ernment.
I am unalterably opposed to the Bricker
Amendment as reported by the Senate Judiciary
Committee. It would so restrict the conduct of
foreign affairs that our country could not nego-
tiate the agreements necessary for the handling of
our business with the rest of the world. Such an
amendment would make it impossible for us to
deal eﬁ'ectively with friendly nations for our mu-
tual defense and common interests.
‘At his press conference on Jan. 27, the President an-
nounced that Mr. Randall would serve as special White
House consultant, to assist in the formulation of speciﬁc
recommendations regarding the substantive areas covered
by the report.

ment by the President regarding proposals to amend the
Constitution with respect to the making of treaties and
other international agreements, see Buuxrnv of Aug. 10,
1953, p. 192.

S. J. Res. 11
JOINT RESOLUTION
Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the
United States, relating to the legal eﬁ’ect of
certain treaties and executive agreements.
Rssorvm by the Senate and House of Represent-
atives of the United States of America in Congress
assembled (two~thirds of each House concurring
therein), That the following article is proposed as
an amendment to the Constitution of the United
States, which shall be valid to all intents and pur-
poses as part of the Constitution when ratiﬁed
by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several
States:
“Aaricu: —
"Section 1. A provision of a treaty which con-
ﬁlcts with this Constitution shall not be of any
force or eﬂect.
“Sec. 2. A treaty shall become effective as in-
ternal law in the United States only through legis-
lation which would be valid in the absence of treaty.
“Size. 8. Congress shall have power to regulate
all executive and other agreements with any foreign
power or international organization. All such
agreements shall be subject to the limitations im-
posed on treaties by this article.
“Sec. 4. The Congress shall have power to en-
force this article by appropriate legislation.
“Site. 5. This article shall be inoperative unless
it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the
Constitution by the legislatures or threefonrths of
the several States within seven years from the date
of its submission."
‘As reported by the Committee on the Judiciary
on June 15 (legislative day, June 8), 1953 (Sen.
llept. 412, 83d Cong., 1st sess.).



These matters are fundamental. “'e cannot
hope to achieve and maintain ace if we shackle
the Federal Government so t at it is no longer
sovereign in foreign aﬁ'airs. The President must
not be deprived of his historic position as the
spokesman for the nation in its relations with
other countries.
Adoption of the Bricker Amendment in its pres-
ent form by the Senate would be notice to our
friends as well as our enemies abroad that our
country intends to withdraw from its leadership
in world affairs. The inevitable reaction would
be of major pro ortion. It would impair our
hopes and plans or peace and for the successful
achievement of the important international mat-
ters now under discussion. This would include
the diversion of atomic energy from warlike to
peaceful pur oses.
I fully su scribe to the proposition that no
treat or international agreement can contravene
the Constitution. I am aware of the feeling of
many of our citizens that a treaty may override
the Constitution. So that there can be no ques-
tion on this point, I will gladly support an appro-
priate amendment that will make this clear for all
time.
Sincerely,
Dwmrrr D. Ersaxnowm.
