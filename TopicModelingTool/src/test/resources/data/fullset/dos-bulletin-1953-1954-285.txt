between the two gates the risoner would be
checked on a roster and if he esired repatriation
he could then so indicate by informing the custo-
dian force, India guard or b proceeding in a
different direction than the bu k of the prisoners.
Evidence that this ﬁnal opportunity for repatria-
tion existed is the fact that approximately 100 indi-
viduals elected to separate themselves from the
large majority who did not wish repatriation.
Our side wishes to emphasize that each pris-
oner of war was given the opportunity to request
repatriation. As each prisoner of war left his
compound the procedures established by the cus-
todian force, India permitted him to proceed in-
dividuallry]7 from the inner gate to the outer gate.
During t is period there was no possibility of his
fellow prisoners preventing his going to the In-
dian guard and requesting repatriation if he so
desired. At all times there were suﬁicient Indian
guards present to protect any individual who
wished to leave his group and seek repatriation.
Our side repeats that approximately 100 prisoners
of war availed themselves of this opportunity.
Your side violated the armistice agreement by
broadcasting threatening messages to the prison-
ers of war on 20 January. In effect, though il-
legally, you completed your explanations to all
prisoners of war. Only approximately 100 re-
quested repatriation.
The major result of your broadcast was to ex-
pedite the transfer and make it more orderly.
ou made the choice clear and the vast majority,
without hesitation, rejected both your threats and
your promises. For your help in giving a deﬁnite
purpose to the movement, our side expresses its
appreciation to the senior member of your side.
At 0910 hours on 20 January the ﬁrst grou
of Chinese prisoners were out of the demilitarizeg
zone and being loaded in trucks for movement
south. At 1033 hours the ﬁrst group of Korean
prisoners of war began moving across the south-
ern boundary of the demilitarized zone. The
movement continued without incident until all of
the Korean prisoners of war had been loaded on
trains and the last train began its southward
movement at 2116 hours. The last of the Chinese
prisoners of war were loaded on trucks and were
moving south at 0249 hours on 21 January 1954.
The custodian force, India reports that ap-
proximately 21,800 prisoners of war were released
to the United Nations Command within 171/;
hours after the ﬁrst man moved into the area
under the control of our side. The best evidence of
the voluntary nature of the southward movement
of this large number of prisoners of war is the
ease with which this mass transfer was effected.
They moved a distance of 1% to 2% miles of their
own free will, not under the direction of any
guards. Further evidence that this was a volun-
tary and orderly move is the fact that there were
no injuries or incidents such as certainly would
have occurred had the prisoners of war been
forced against their will to return to our side.
The prisoners of war were happy and coo rative.
Their bands played. The men sang an waved
their ﬂags.
