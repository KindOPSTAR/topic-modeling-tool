Mexican Migrant Labor
White House press release dated March 16
Following is the text of a statement made by
President Eisenhower on March 16 at the time of
his signing of H. J. Res. 355 (Public Law 309, 83d
Congress) :
On signing this legislation, I wish to dispel any
misconceptions which may exist regarding its
purpose. The basic purpose is to enable this Gov-
ernment to give Mexican migrant labor the
protection of our laws.
Whenever United States employment is at such
a level that Mexican workers are needed to sup-
plement the United States labor force and when-
ever they can be spared temporarily from Mexico,
we of course welcome their valuab e assistance to
our farmin community if they will cross the
border lega y. The problem of adequate control
and protection of Mexican workers in the United
States has in recent years been the subject of
searchin analysis by the Governments of the
United States and Mexico, working both inde-
pendently and together.
The two Governments, after more than 4 months
of careful study and friendly negotiation—con-
ducted in an atmosphere of mutual res ect worth
of two sovereign neighbors, announces on Mare
10 that they had concluded a renewed and im-
pjroved migrant labor a reement. While neither
overnment assumes t at this agreement will
prove to be the ﬁnal answer to the whole complex
problem, it provides necessary means for moving
orward to more complete solutions.
Unforeseeable future developments may some
day lead the two Governments to determine that
formal agreement on this subject is no longer de-
sirable but that appropriate action h each within
its own jurisdiction is still essentia . Authority
has existed for a number of years for the Attorney
General to admit Mexican farm workers under
whatever conditions he alone may establish, but,
because of the wording of applicable legislation,
there has not been adequate authority for United
States governmental measures for protection and
placement of the workers at any time there should
not be an agreement with Mexico. The resent
law is precautionary in that it removes t is dis-
ability and enables the Secretary of Labor to per-
form these functions of protecting and placin
mi ant workers which are so important to bot
United States and Mexican interests, at any time
these services may be required.
