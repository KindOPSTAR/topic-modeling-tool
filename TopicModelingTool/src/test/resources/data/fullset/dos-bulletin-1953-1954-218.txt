“'e face the fact that Germany has been divided
now for nearly 9 years. Part of Germany has
been identiﬁed with the Soviet system, the Eastern
part of German , and the Western part of Ger-
many has been i entiﬁed with the Western system.
All the Germans. East or West, now have a very
good idea as to what is the meaning and signiﬁ-
cance of our respective s stems.
We believe that the time has come when that
division cannot be continued without very great
peril to all of us, and that the next step is to
unite Germany through free elections, and give
united Germany a genuine choice as to what it
wants to do.
One of those choices may be the choice of be-
coming a member of the contemplated European
Defense Community. We do not disguise the fact
that we hope that that choice will be available to
Germany. We do not disguise the fact that some
of us, at least, hope Germany will make that
choice. But I do want to emphasize, in categori-
cal terms, the fact that we do intend that united
Germany should have a real choice in the matter.
If I have not expressed myself earlier, it was
only because it seemed to me that the remarks
which had already been made by Mr. Bidault and
Mr. Eden were so clear and so obviously based
upon the terms of the proposals which Mr. Eden
had made there could not be any real doubt about
the matter.
If the Soviet Foreign Minister feels that the
language in the proposal tabled b Mr. Eden ‘ is
not entirel clear in that respect, have no doubt
that Mr. den would agree to whatever clarifica-
tion is necessary so as to eliminate any last trace
of doubt on that proposition.
It is basic in the thinkin which the United
States has—-and I believe it is shared by France
and the United Kingdom—that a united Germany
should in fact have a free choice in this matter.
I suspect, however, that the problem which Mr.
Molotov has posed here could not be really settled
in the simple way I just described, simply by
clariﬁcation of the text which we are considering.
I am afraid that what is really g'vin Mr. Molotov
concern is the fear that the ch01ce w llCll we would
offer Germany would be exercised in a sense favor-
able to adhesmn to the Community, which appar-
ently the Soviet Foreign Minister fears, and it is
that which is primarily causing him concern.
There has unfortunately developed among us a
deep-rooted suspicion that any result which is
sought by the “'estern Powers is automatically
something which is undesirable or dangerous to-
ward the Eastern Powers and vice versa. I ho
that that suspicion can to some extent be dispelled
and that it could be recognized here that the result
which we. are seeking is a result which, while it
would be beneﬁcial to the Western Powers, would
equally be. beneﬁcial to the Soviet Union.
' Bruit-rm of Feb. 8, p. 186.
I have spent some time in my earlier presenta-
tions trying to present as persuasively as I could
the reasons why I believe t iat the participation of
Germany in a European defense community,
which would mean no national army for Germany
and no eneral staff for German , would produce
most e ectively the result whic all four of us
around this table want des rately to assure; that
is, a Germany which for t e future will be com-
mitted to ways of peace and that there would be
no repetition of the disastrous past.
I hope that, as a result of our talks here, there
will come to the Soviet Union a genuine realization
that what we are seeking here is something which
is in the common interest; that therefore they
should not fear giving the Germans a really genu-
ine opportunity to choose it, if that is their desire.
STATEMENT OF FEBRUARY 4
Press release 56 dated February 5
I have been told that the zigzag was an essential
part of the Soviet practice. If so, I think that the
discussions of the last few days form a classic
example.
I have seldom been as confused in m life as I
am at this moment We have been de atin for
several days the plan which you tabled, Mr. C air-
man, and we discussed a section to which Mr.
Molotov devoted his attention. And after we
ﬁnally had agreed, the three of us, to amend it to
meet what we understood were Mr. Molotov’s
views, then he said he rejected the whole plan.
I wonder why we spent so lon debating one
paragraph of the plan if the wholze plan was un-
acceptable.
Then, Mr. Molotov, as I understood attacked
our roposal on the ground that it did not. give
the rmans sufﬁcient freedom of choice as to
what they would do in relation to their future
international relations. And when we had pains-
takingly explained that the plan did give them
complete freedom of choice in that matter, then
apparently the plan could not meet Mr. Molotov's
approval because it gives the Germans too much
freedom.
He explained at great length how the Germans
could not be trusted with freedom; how they had
abused freedom in the past; and from that it is
to be inferred that they should not have the free-
dom that they had in the past. And there again
I am completely confused and bewildered.
Then there was a question of the all-German
elections. The plan which you tabled, Mr. Chair-
man, provided for the careful supervision of the
elections, not only supervised by the four occupy-
ing powers, but also possibly by neutrals, to be
sure there would be true freedom of elections.
But Mr. Molotov says that that proposal indi-
