' The Evolution of Foreign Policy
Address by Secretary Dulles ‘
It is now nearly a year since the Eisenhower
administration took oﬂice. During that ear I
have often spoken of various parts of our oreign
policies. Tonight I should like to present an
overall view of those policies which re ate to our
security.
First of all, let us recognize that many of the
receding forei policies were 00d. Aid to
‘reece and Tur 'ey had checked t \e Communist
drive to the Mediterranean. The European Re-
covery Program had helped the peoples of \Vest-
ern Europe to pull out of the postwar morass.
The Western powers were steadfast in Berlin and
overcame the blockade with their airlift. As a
loyal member of the United Nations, we had re-
acted with force to repel the Communist attack
in Korea. “'hen that eﬂ'ort exposed our military
weakness, we rebuilt rapidly our militar estab-
lishment. We also sought a quick buildup of
armed strength in Western Europe.
These were the acts of a nation which saw the
danger of Soviet communism; which realized that
its own safety was tied up with that of others;
which was capable of responding boldly and
promptly to emergencies. These are precious
values to be acclaimed. Also, we can pay tribute
to congressional bipartisanship which puts the na-
tion above politics.
But we need to recall that what we did was in
the main emergency action, imposed on us by our
enemies.
Let me illustrate.
l. “'e did not send our army into Korea be-
cause we judged in advance that it was sound
military strategy to commit our Army to ﬁght
land battles in Asia. Our decision had been to
pull out of Korea. It was Soviet-inspired action
that pulled us back.
2. We did not decide in advance that it was
wise to grant billions annually as foreign eco-

nomic aid. We adopted that policy in response
to the Communist efforts to sabotage the free
economies of Western Europe.
3. We did not build up our military establish-
ment at a rate which inmlved huge budget deﬁ-
cits, a depreciating currency, and a feverish econ-
omy because this seemed, in advance, a 00d
olicy. Indeed, we decided otherwise unti the
boviet military threat was clearly revealed.
\Ve live in a world where emergencies are al-
ways possible, and our survival may depend upon
our capacity to meet emergencies. Let us ray
that we shall always have that capacity. ut,
having said that, it is necessary also to say that
emergency measures—however good for the
emergency—do not necessarily make good per-
manent policies. Emergency measures are costly;
they are superﬁcial; and they imply that the
enemy has the initiative. They cannot be de-
pended on to serve our long-time interests.
The Need for Long-Range Policies
This “long time” factor is of critical impor-
tance.
The Soviet Communists are planning for what
they call “an entire historical era,” and we should
do the same. They seek, through many types of
maneuvers, gradually to divide and weaken the
free nations by overextending them in eﬂ'orts
which, as Lenin put it, are “beyond their
strength, so that they come to practical bank-
ruptcy.” Then, said Lenin, “our victory is as-
sured.” Then, said Stalin, will be “the moment
for the decisive blow.”
In the face of this strategy, measures cannot be
judged ad uate merely because they ward off an
immediate anger. It is essential to do this, but
it is also essential to do so without exhausting
ourselves.
When the Eisenhower administration applied
this test, we felt that some transformations were
needed.
It is not sound military strategy permanently
