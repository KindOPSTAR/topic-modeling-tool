The resources of Southeast Asia, as I have said,
are the third objective of the Communists in Asia.
And just as they saw Korea as the gateway to
Japan, they see Indochina as the gateway to the
southeast.
Stopping the Communists in Indochina has been
the res onsibility of France and the Vietnamese.
It has een a costly o ration for both. Our aid
has been supplementa . We are not a belligerent
and we do not call the shots.
Capitalizing on Nationalism
In Indochina, as elsewhere in Asia, the Com-
munists have tried to identify themselves with the
nationalist movement. It has been, in Viet-Nam,
their strongest weapon. The truth is, of course,
that Ho Chi-Minh is a 100 percent Marxist. The
independence he promises would be a mockery.
His victory would add Indochina to the unhappy
list of Communist satellites.
Actually the Vietnamese Government, like the
Governments of the other two Associated States,
Cambodia and Laos, has been moving steadily to-
ward inde endence. Increasingly the nationalist
regimes o the three states have been challenging
the false claims of the Communists. As they
row in political stature a new s irit will pervade
t e area, backed by the nationa armies now de-
veloping under the com etent leadership of Gen-
eral Navarre, Comman er of the French Union
Forces.
In Indochina, as elsewhere in Asia, our objec-
tive is the creation of strength on the side of the
nationalist forces and real freedom for the people.
We are contributing, when such aid is requested,
toward that stren h. We have had a military
mission in Indochina since 1950 and have con-
tributed substantially to the military programs.
Elsewhere in the area we are also aidin anti-
Communist forces. We have agreed to ai Pak-
istan in the buildup of its military force. Similar
aid has been offered India.
As you know, since 1951 we have had treaties
of mutual defense with Australia and New Zea-
land. A similar treaty with the Philippines was
signed in August of 1951. A third, with Japan,
was a eed upon in September 1951. We have
one in orea.
Secretary Dulles, in his 8 eech to the Nation on
February 24,” reported on t e United States posi-
tion and accom lishments at the Four-Power Con-
ference which ad just concluded in Berlin. In
discussing the agreement in Berlin to hold a sub-
sequent meeting at Geneva to which a number of
other articipants, including Communist China,
would e inwted, he made clear what the position
of Communist China would be, saying:
Under [the Berlin] resolution the Communist regime
will not come to Geneva to be honored by us, but rather
to account before the bar of world opinion.
'annm of Mar. 8, 1954, p. 343.
The conference at Geneva is, in fact, the Korean
Political Conference which we had been trying
to get at Panmunjom. We already had been talk-
ing to the Chinese Communists at Panmun'om as
the malevolent force that had brutally attac ed an
outpost of the free world. That is the only role
in which they will appear at Geneva. They can-
not inﬂate it with the wind of their propaganda.
Moreover, the Soviet Union a pears as no
neutral. Its role in organizing, irecting, and
supplying the a gression against the Republic of
Korea is too we I known. At Geneva the Soviet
Union, their North Korean creation, and Com-
munist China—the forces responsible for the ag-
gression in Korea—will be represented on one
side; on the other side will be those who halted
the aggression—the Republic of Korea and the
nations who contributed forces to the United
Nations Command.
Thus, at Geneva the free world side will be
callin the Communist side to account and de-
manding that they make clear their future inten-
tions. The Soviet Union and Communist China
both were involved from beginning to end of the
war in Korea.
It also was agreed at Berlin that the problem
of restoring peace in Indochina would be discussed
in the conference at Geneva. Here again it is
the Communists who are being called to account
before the bar of world 0 inion. The Communist
Viet Minh regime is ful y attached to the world
Communist movement under Moscow’s direction.
The reality of this situation makes it obvious that
the discussions on both Korea and Indochina at
Geneva will be essentially a conference between
the side of Communist aggression and the side of
freedom.
Anti-Communist states of Asia are themselves
considering a mutual defense pact. We would
encourage such action b the Paciﬁc community
and would cooperate wit such an association.
Scope of Technical Assistance Programs
The milita aid we are iving our friends of
Asia and the iddle East IS a necessity. How-
ever, as a nation we have never put our sole con-
ﬁdence in “reekin tube and iron shard.” Our
programs of technical assistance are carrying to
nation after nation the skills and experience de-
veloped over the centuries on our own soil.
United States technicians are now in 38 under-
developed countries demonstratin American
good will and assisting the peoples 0 these coun-
tries in economic and social pro ress.
For example: Sixteen United tates technicians
have cooperated with the Government of Indo-
nesia in a program which has given 2 million
people protection against malaria.
In Iran, United States technicians have been
working with the Iranian Ministry of Health, the
United Nations World Health Organization, and
the University of Tehran in a malaria control
