Malarlo Control
Malaria control protection will be extended to
a total of 125 million people in India as a result of
the si 'ng of a new agreement under the Indo-
American technical cooperation program, the Foa
announced on March 10.
Under the agreement signed in New Delhi by
representatives of the F GA and the Government of
India, 35 additional malaria units will be estab-
lished in India. This will bring to 125 the number
of units established since 1952 under the joint pro—
am and malaria coverage of 125 million persons
y March 31, 1955.
The United States is contributing $4,660,000 to
the latest phase of the pro am to ﬁnance the pur-
chase of 5,730 tons of DT, 35 petrol-driven
spraying units, 183 vehicles and 2,714 hand ray-
ers and stirrup pumps. The Indian contribution is
22,533,000 rupees (equivalent to about $4,720,000) .
The malaria-control program is the major
health eﬁ'ort under the Indo-American rogram.
It is aimed at reducing 100 million cases of malaria
a year to one million cases or less. Through the
nationwide campaign, it is planned to reduce the
incidence of malaria to the point where normal
control measures can keep it from ever a ain be-
coming a serious health or economic pro lem.
Fukuryu Maru Accident
Press release 187 dated April 9
Following is the text of a statement issued at
Tokg/o on April 9 by John 11!. Allison, American
Am assador to Japan:
On the occasion of the departure from Tokyo of
Mr. Merrill Eisenbud, Director of the Health and
Safety laboratory of the Atomic Energy Com-
mission, and of Dr. John Morton, Director of the
Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission and his staff
of associate hysicians, I wish to express again in
the name ofp the United States Government our
dee regret for the unfortunate accident to the
F ryu Maru and our continuing concern for
the recove and well-being of its hospitalized
crewmen. have already announced the inten-
tion of the United States Government both to re-
imburse the Japanese Government for interim
ﬁnancial assistance to the patients and their fam-
ilies and, for the future, to take all possible meas-
ures to prevent any recurrence of this most re-
ettable accident.
I have thanked Dr. Morton and Mr. Eisenbud
for their important contributions to the resolu-
tion of many of the problems which arose after this
most regrettable accident and I should like to re-
cord In own appreciation of what, in cooperation
with o cials and scientists of the Japanese Gov-
ernment, they have been able to accomplish since
their arrival here.
Mr. Eisenbud and Dr. Morton and his staff were
directed to come to Tokyo by the United States
Government, immediately on notiﬁcation of the
mishap to the Fukuryu Maru. Their primary
purpose was to assist, as consultants to the J apa-
nese doctors in charge of the case, in the recovery
of the twenty-three patients. They were also to
offer to the Japanese Government specialists in
charge of the public health and ﬁshing industry
aspects of the case their long professional experi-
ence in the evaluation of radioactive hazards. Dr.
Morton and his staff arrived in Tokyo on March
18, Mr. Eisenbud on March 22. Since that time,
the following results have been accomplished:
(1) The examinations they have made in Japan
have corroborated completely the results of longer
and more detailed studies in the continental United
States which have established the groundlessness
of fears concerning the long-range contamination
of the atmosphere or the ocean or of water or air
currents. Mr. Eisenbud has made the results of
his examinations and of these longer studies avail-
able to the Japanese scientists.
Mr. Eisenbud, in behalf of the Atomic Energy
Commission, has offered to provide the Japanese
scientists, should they so desire, equipment used
in the United States for routine monitorin of the
daily depositions of radioactive dust om all
sources.
(2) Mr. Eisenbud has communicated to his
Japanese colleagues the results of American
studies concerning the fate of radioactive debris
originating from the detonation of nuclear devices
in the Marshall Islands. These studies formed
the basis for a public statement made on March
24 conveyin assurances that radioactivity is not
bein carrieﬁ by oceanic currents beyond the im-
mediate vicinity of the test area. Traces of radio-
activity can be expected to be reported from time
to time but only in harmless amounts that will
barely be detectable against the ever-present back-
ground of natural radioactivity.
_ (3) In recognition of the importance of marine
ecology to the Japanese economy, Mr. Eisenbud
has conveyed, through Dr. Kobayashi of the Na-
tional Institute of Health and Chairman of the
Atom Bomb Injury Investigation Committee of
Japan, the willingness of the United States Atomic
Energy Commission to offer ﬁnancial support to
Japanese scientists who wish to continue their in-
vestigations in this ﬁeld.
(4) In cooperation with Japanese scientists,
they have established the fact that no commercial
hazard exists to the Japanese tuna industry. They
were requested by the Japanese authorities to
recommend a monitoring procedure for export
tuna and did so as a precautionary measure. I
