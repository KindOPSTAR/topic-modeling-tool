there has been a succession of exposures and judi-
cial convictions which prove that international
communism plots against our form of government.
I venture to say that every delegate here knows
of similar activ ties within his own country which
are being conducted from Moscow or way stations.
This Communist conspiracy is not to be taken
lightly. Its agents 0 crate under the iron dis-
cipline of the Soviet ommunist Party, acting as
the self-proclaimed “General Staff of the \Vorld
Proletariat.” The agents themselves, in order to
gain a following, pretend to be reformists seeking
to eradicate the evils which exist in any society.
None of us want to be maneuvered into the posi-
tion of defending whatever Communists attack.
We do not carry on olitical warfare against ideas
or ideals. But equa ly we must not be blind to the
fact that the international conspiracy I describe
has in 15 years been primarily responsible for
~~ turning what were 15 independent nations into
/
Soviet colonies, and they would if they could
du )licate that performance here.
n the past century battleships were the symbol
of aggression against the hemis here. Today the
apparatus of an alien politica party endangers
the independence and solidarity of the Americas.
From the earliest days of the independence of our
countries we have all stood resolutely for the in-
tegrity of this hemisphere. We have seen that
that integrity would be endangered unless we stood
resolutely against an enlargement here of the
colonial domain of t c European powers. \Ve
have made our position in this matter so clear that
it is known to and accepted by all the world.
What was a great danger has thus receded.
We have not made it equall clear that the in-
tegrity of this hemisphere an the peace, safety,
and ha piness of us all may be endangered by
politica penetration from without and that we
stand resolutely and unitedly a ainst that form of
danger. Because our position as not been made
clear, the danger mounts. I believe that it is time
to make it clear with ﬁnality that we see that aliexT
despotism is hostile to our ideals, that we unitedly
deny it the right to prey u'pOn our hemis here, and
that if it does not heed our warning and eep away
we shall deal with it as a situation that might
endanger the peace of America.
What I suggest does not involve any interfer-
ence in the internal affairs of any American Re-
public. There is ample room for natural dif-
ferences and for tolerances between the political /
l/institutions of the different American states. But/ ~ '
,/ there is no place here for
V olitical institution’sv...
which-serve'alienlniasters. hope that we can
agree to make that clear.
Of course there will be some in other lands who
will not like that. Pravda, the ofﬁcial organ of
the Soviet Communist Party at Moscow, carried
an important editorial on March 2 which was ad-
dressed to us here. It protested against the pos-
sibility that this Inter-American Conference
might adopt an anti-Communist resolution. I
suggest that rather than listen to those words we
listen to the. \\'()l'(lS of Simon Bolivar, in whose
birthplace we meet. He symbolizes the independ-
ence to which we all are dedicated. Addressing
the Congress of our host nation more than a con
tury ago, he said, “Slavery is the otfs ring of dark-
ness; an ignorant people is a blin tool, turned
to its own destruction; ambition and intrigue ex-
ploit the credulit of men foreign to all political,
economic or civi knowledge; mere illusions are
accepted as reality, licenses taken as liberty,
treacherv for patriotism, revenge for justice.”
This Conference has been shocked by the das-
tardly attack on Members of the United States
Congress by those who professed to be “patriots.”
They may not themselves be Communists. But
they had been subjected to the inﬂammatory in-
ﬂuence of communism, which avowedly uses ex-
treme nationalism as one of its tools. What they
did is precise] in the Soviet Communist pattern.
It should hanan our resolve to be alert to dan er
and to detect and thwart the plotting of thosewv o
in the name of “nationalism? and “patriotism”
do what in fact destroys liberty'and turns men
and nations into slaves. "
The United States recognizes that the freedom
and independence which we all covet, and which
we are resolved to preserve, is based not only on
political and moral considerations but also on eco-
nomic and social well-being. The United States
Government is conﬁdent of its ability to maintain
the health and vigor of its own national economy.
President Eisenhower, in his recent economic re-
port to the Congress, said that “the arsenal of
weapons at the isposal of the Government for
maintaining economic stability is formidable.”


The Economic Problem
This is important not only for ourselves but
also for others. A high level of economic activity
within the United States creates a demand for im-
ports and provides the means for continued eco-
nomic development in this hemisphere and else-
where. It is, of course, a fact and properly a fact
that no government operates rimarily in the
interests of other peoples. The t responsibility
of every government 13 to its own eople, for whom
it acts in a trustee capacity. evertheless it is
also true that no overnment adequately serves
its own people unless it also is concerned with
well-being in other countries.
Nations generally have it within their own
power to do most of what is required for decent
and healthy social conditions for their people.
The task is thus primarily a domestic one. But
there is need for international conditions which
facilitate a mutually advantageous exchange of
goods and a mutually advantageous ﬂow of capital
from the more developed countries to the countries
which are less developed. That is for all a matter
of enlightened self-interest.
