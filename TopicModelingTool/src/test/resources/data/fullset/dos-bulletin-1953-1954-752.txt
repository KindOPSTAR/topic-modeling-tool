stant friction and potential strife. The Jordan
Valley lies at the very heart of the political ten-
sions which keep the whole Middle East in a state
of perilous ferment and discord.
Neither Israel, in a hurry to get on with its own
development, nor the Arab countries, alive with
pressures for economic and social progress, are
like] to sit idly by and watch the precious waters
of t e Jordan go on gliding by unused. But
unless a mutually acceptable formula can be found
for dividing the water fairly among them, any at-
tempt by one country to harness the stream for its
own use will be an explosive provocation to the
others.
Even more important, perhaps, is the fact that
the Jordan, harnessed for irrigation, would pro-
vide a livelihood on the land for thousands of
Arabs displaced from their former homes in
Palestine by the terrible events of recent years.
Living in cam s maintained by the United Na-
tions Relief an Works Agency, or in caves or
primitive huts, these unhappy people have for 6
years borne the brunt of mis ortune deriving from
the conﬂict between the Arab nations and Israel.
Today thousands of them are homeless, landless,
penniless, and increasingly hopeless.
In the Jordan Valley, on lands watered through
modern irrigation canals, many of these people
could be given a new econ0mic stake and the di -
nity of independence once again. While it would
not solve the whole problem of the Arab refugees,
who number more t an 800,000, settlement in the
Jordan Valley would at least ameliorate the ten-
sion. It would ease the burning sense of frustra-
tion and resentment they now feel after 6 long
years of displacement and defeated hope.
If accepted by all four of the states concerned,
therefore, a comprehensive program for develop-
ing the Jordan River basin would do several
things: ﬁrst, it would form the basis for an equit-
able allocation of the available waters and thus
take the river out of the area of controversy;
second, it would mark at least the beginning of a
constructive, practical, and long overdue solution
of the refugee problem, and thus help to clear the
atmosphere of bitterness and resentment; third, it
would contribute to a general rise in economic
levels and thus help to promote social progress
in the region.
Perhaps nowhere in the world would a program
of water and power development produce greater
tangible and intangible beneﬁt. In terms of hu-
man welfare and of world peace, the dams and
irrigation works involved would have a value
wholly out of proportion to the geographic size
and importance of the valley itself.
Now just what was it that I proposed to the
Arab States and Israel 5 months ago?
Actually, it was not a “plan,” but a broad con-
ception of what might be done, offered as a basis
for discussion and negotiation. In outline, the
core of the idea is to use Lake Tiberias as a natural
storage reservoir for the waters of the Jordan and
its principal tributary, the Yarmuk. These waters
would be released through a system of canals for
all-year irrigation in the lower valle . Israel’s
share would be drawn mainly from headwaters
upstream from Tiberias.
Scope of Suggested Project
Thus harnessed and controlled, the waters of the
Jordan system would rovide steady year-round
irrigation for a total 0 some 234,000 acres of land
not now irrigated in the watershed—much of it
capable of producing crops all year round. Some
38,000 kilowatts of electric energy could be pro-
duced through a power installation on the Yarmuk
and some 27,000 kilowatts at another plant near
Tel Hai in Israel.
In the original proposals advanced 5 months
ago, tentative year] allocations of water were
suggested: 426 million cubic meters to irrigate
104,000 acres in Israel; 829 million cubic meters to
irrigate 122,500 acres in Jordan; and 50 million
cublc meters to water 7,500 acres in Syria. These,
however, were subject to discussion and possible
revision on the basis of detailed engineering
studies and other considerations.
By way of comparison and as an indication of
the size and economic value of the project, however,
it is slightly larger than the 225,000-acre Salt
River project near Phoenix, Arizona. This is
three-cro land, generally comparable to much of
the area t at can be irrigated in the Jordan Valley.
The gross value of the crops grown in the Salt
River project is $60,690,000 a year. That is a cro
income of $268 an acre. The city of Phoenix 1s
largely supported by this revenue from the irri-
gated farming lands around it.
Up in my native Paciﬁc Northwest, the lar est
of a l U.S. irrigation projects is in the Colum ia
River Basin where 1,000,000 acres will be irrigated
by water from Grand Coulee Dam. This is one-
crop land. Assuming that two-thirds of the J or-
dan Valley’s ,irri able land, or about 150 000 acres,
is three-crop lan , the project, in terms of crop pro-
duction, would be approximately half as large as
our largest American irrigation operation.
None of the details of the idea I put forward on
behalf of the President last November were ﬁxed
in a rigid pattern or an ironclad plan. \Ve did
not offer a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. On my
ﬁrst visit to the area in connection with my mis-
sion, I merely asked the Governments of Jordan,
Syria, Lebanon, and Israel to consider the idea of
total valley development on its merits as an eco-
nomic proposition, outside the context of the
political issues between them. I assured them of
American interest in the project and of American
support and assistance in carrying it out, if the
principle were accepted.
