I think, a ﬁne illustration of the bold resource-
fulness of the Secretar of State in his dealings
with Mr. Molotov. “7 at I am about to read is
a statement of Mr. Dulles made at the session of
February 2, in response to Mr. Molotov’s violent
attack on the Western Powers. It is as follows: a
I do not know what the Soviet Foreign Minister really
thinks about us. Whatever his judgment is, he must
know that he is not infallible. He has sometimes been
wrong. and he might have been wrong when be accused
us yesterday of being the enemies of peace.
I recall that Mr. Molotov was wrong in October 1939
when he condemned France and Britain as being ag-
gressors and praised Hitlerite Germany as being the
peace-seeking country. I have in my hands a speech
which the Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs made in
Moscow on October 31, 1939. Already the war was on
and. in Moiotov’s words: “It needed only one swift blow
to Poland ﬁrst by the German Army and then by the Red
Army, and nothing remained of this ugly offspring of the
Versailles Treaty." In that speech. Mr. Molotov boasted
of the “rapprochement and the establishment of friendly
relations between the U.S.S.R. and Germany." He then
said that "as far as the European great powers are con-
cerned, Germany is in the position of a state which is
striving for the earliest termination of the war and for
peace, whereas Great Britain and France, which but
yesterday were declaiming against aggression, are in
favor of continuing the war and are opposed to the con-
clusion of peace.” “It is," said Mr. Molotov, “not only
senseless but criminal to wage such a war—a war for the
'destruction of Hitlerism' camouﬂaged as a ﬁght for
‘democracy’."
Perhaps Mr. Molotov would admit that he then made a
mistake—we all make mistakes. That fact should lead
us not to be so conﬁdent of our Judgment that we hurl
across the table accusations of criminal intent.
The question is freq ently asked: Has the State
De artment chan ed . Has the mess been cleaned
up There is, 0 course, a difference of o inion
on that subject, but there is one eminent aut ority
on the change—the new look in the State Depart-
ment. He can testify on that subject. His name
is Molotov, Foreign Minister of the U.S.S.R.
Security Problems Involved
As we gradually et into a osition where we
justify public conﬁ ence in t e Department of
State, we must necessarily consider the security
problems involved in this highly sensitive opera-
tion. The security situation is a large part of the
administration problem. I personally feel that
there are probably very few, if any, people in the
Department who are opposed to the idea of sound
security practice. However, I do feel there may
be a misunderstandin as to just what we are try-
ing to do in the securlty ﬁeld.
There are a great many aspects to security as
such. The State Department contributes to the
national security in the ﬁeld of consular affairs
when the Department issues visas which ermit
aliens to visit America and passports whic per-
mit Americans to travel abroad. That can be a
very important aspect of security because we know
'Ibid., p. 79; BULLETIN oi! Feb. 15, 1954, p. 223.
from the past that the American passport has in
some instances been forged or used fraudulently
in order to permit unworthy persons to enter
the country. The issuance of visas calls for a high
degree of security since it is necessary to ascer-
tain that the immigrant or would-be visitor is a
person who will not contribute to the insecurity
of a nation.
There are other aspects of securit , particularly
in this modern day when we ﬁn ourselves in
close cooperation in the military ﬁeld with our
Western allies. The Department’s diplomatic
representatives must constantly backstop our mili-
tary people, as agreements are negotiated with
other nations. 0 course, there is the matter of
security cooperation with other security agencies
both in our own government and in the govern—
ments of our allies.
I mention these aspects of securit because they
are generally forgotten by the pub ic which asso-
ciates the term security in the ﬁeld of govern-
ment with the personnel security and integrity
practices which the new team is following under
the Eisenhower Executive Order 10450.‘
In addition to the other duties I have outlined
above, our Security Ofﬁce in the State Department
handles the ph sical security of the Department
which may be deﬁned as the protection of classi-
ﬁed information which the Department possesses.
This involves seeing that the material is properly
classiﬁed, stored, and protected and that, in the
buildings in which the information is housed,
there is a minimum hazard of ﬁre and enemy pene-
tration.
This involves considerable technical knowledge
and, over a period of years, a considerable ex-
penditure of funds. Insofar as physical security
is concerned, I have detected no background which
indicates that Congress has been ni gardly in the
matter of appropriating funds for tﬁls purpose.
Nevertheless while we may spend millions of
dollars to make our information and our build-
ings as secure as possible in the hysical sense,
this money can be wasted if a sing e employee of
the Department proves to be untrustworthy.
I would like, in a few moments, to outline the
ersonnel securit and integrity measures of the
isenhower administration as they relate to the
State Department in the hopes that through better
understanding of what we are trying to do we
can secure your sympathetic support for this
program.
