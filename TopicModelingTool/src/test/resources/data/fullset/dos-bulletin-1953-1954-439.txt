not only exposes those particular forces which he
chooses to use for his aggression, but also deprives
his other assets of “sanctuary” status. That does
not mean turning every local war into a world
war. It does not mean that, if there is a Com-
munist attack somewhere in Asia, atom or hydro-
gen bombs will necessarily be dropped on the great
industrial centers of China or ussia. It does
mean that the free world must maintain the col-
lective means and be willing to use them in the
we which most effectively makes aggression too
ris y and expensive to be tempting.
It is sometimes said that this system is inade-
uate because it assures an invaded country only
t at it will eventually be liberated and the invader
unished. That observation misses the oint.
he point is that a prospective attacker is not
likely to invade if he believes the probable hurt
will outbalance the probable gain. A system
which compels potential aggressors to face up to
that fact indispensany supplements a local defen-
sive system.
Practlcal Appllcatlons
We can already begin to see applications of
these olicies.
In orea the forces ﬁghting aggression had
been so closely limited that they were forbidden
even to apply the doctrine of “hot pursuit” in re-
lation to enem lanes that were based across the
Yalu. The air elds from which attacks were
mounted were immune, as were the lines and
sources of their sup 1 . The ﬁghting there was
ﬁnally stopped last filly on terms which had been
proposed many months before. That result was
achieved, at least in part, because the aggressor,
already denied territorial gains, was faced with
the possibility that the ﬁghting might, to his own
great (peril, soon spread beyond the limits and
metho s which he had selected, to areas and meth-
ods that we would select. In other words, the
prmciple of using methods of our choice was
read to be invoked, and it helped to stop the war
who the enemy had begun and had pursued on
the theory that it would be a limited war, at places
and by means of its choosin .
The _16 members of the gUnited Nations who
fought in Korea have invoked the same principle.
They have glven public notice that if the Com-
munists were to Violate the armistice and renew
the aggression, the response of the United Nations
Command would. not necessarily be conﬁned to
Korea.2 Today, 1f aggression were resumed, the
United Nations Command would certainly feel
free to inﬂict heavy damage upon the aggressor
beyond the immediate area which he chose for his
aggresswn. That need not mean indulging in
atomic warfare throughout Asia. It should not
be stated in advance precisely what would be the

scope of military action if new ag ession oc-
curred. That is a matter as to which t e aggressor
had best remain i orant. But he can know and
does know in the 1ght of present policies, that the
choice in this respect is ours and not his.
In relation to Indochina, the United States has
publicly stated that if there were open Red Chinese
Army aggression there that would have “grave
conseguences which might not be conﬁned to Indo-
china."
On December 26, 1953, President Eisenhower
made an important statement which clearly re-
ﬂected our present policy as applied to Asia.‘ .He
announced a progressive reduction of United
States ground forces in Korea. However, he
went on to point out that United States military
forces in the Far East will now feature “highly
mobile naval, air, and amphibious units”; and
he added that in this way, despite some with-
drawal of land forces, the United States will
have a capacity to oppose aggression “with even
greater effect than hereto ore.” In the same
month the United States reafﬁrmed its intent to
maintain in Okinawa the rights made available
to us by the Japanese peace treaty. This location
is needed to insure striking power to implement
the collective security concept.
In Europe, our intentions are primarily ex-
pressed by the North Atlantic Treaty. Following
the aggression in Korea of June 1950, the treaty
members proceeded to an emergency buildup of
militar strength in Western Europe. The
strengt built between 1950 and 1953 has served
well the cause of peace. But by 1953, it did not
seem necessary to go on at the original pace.
At the April 1953 meeting of the NATO Council,
the United States put forward a new concept,
now known as that of the “long haul.” It meant
a steady development of defensive strength at a
rate which won (1 preserve and not exhaust the
economic strength of our allies and ourselves.
This would be reinforced by the availability of
new weapons of vastly increased destructive
ower and by the striking power of an air force
based on internationally agreed positions. Presi-
dent Eisenhower is now seekin an amendment
of the present law to permit a reer exchange of
atomic information with our NATO allies.
When we went back to the NATO Council meet-
ing of last December we found that there was
eneral acceptance of the “long haul” concept.
he result is that most of our NATO allies are
now able to achieve budgetary and economic
stability, without large dependence on our eco-
nomic aid.
The growing free-world defensive system, sup-
ported by community facilities and coupled with
adequate policies for their use, reﬂects the near-
est approach that the world has yet made to a
