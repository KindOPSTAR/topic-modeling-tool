of votes secured two thirds of the seats; in the
remaining four Communes a form of propor-
tional re resentation was retained. The results
showed t at in the Commune of Trieste, where
approximately 90 per cent of the total population
of the Zone is concentrated, the Christian Demo-
crats remained the largest single party: together
with the other three ‘ centre” arties they com-
mand a majority on the Councill.)
I am again pleased to report that in general the
economic recovery of the Zone continued, and that
a further increase was registered in industrial
production.
Owing to the completion of the ship-building
programme laid down in 1950, the total tonnage
of new shipping constructed during the year was
slightly lower than that of 1951. A new pro-
gramme has, however, been drawn up which
should ensure full employment in the Zone’s yards
during 1953/54.
Owing grincipally to increased competition
from the erman North Sea Ports, commercial
traﬂic through the Port of Trieste showed a slight
decline. This situation was carefully watched
and measures were studied in concert with other
interested railway administrations with a view
to reventing further deterioration.
n pursuance of the policy outlined in my pre-
vious reports, development of the Zaule Industrial
Area continued to be encouraged by every means.
In this area a total of twenty-six industrial lants
were already operating, or in course of comp etion,
an increase of ten over 1951.
The em loyment situation showed little change.
The num r of registered employed decreased
during the year by some 1,500, and the monthly
average of registered unemployed remained
around 19,000.
On 30 June 1952, the M. S. A. Mission in Trieste
was closed and the Zone was included in the sphere
of the M. S. A. Mission to Italy. Lire counter-
art funds from former E. R. P. aid continued to
used for loans for ship-building and other in-
dustries. Nearly all imports from the dollar area
were paid for with “free” dollars made available
by the Italian Government.
The overall improvement in the ﬁnancial situ-
ation of the Zone continued in 1952, a further
sli ht reduction beinrr achieved in the budgetary
de cit. I wish to aclinowledge the fact that this
was, as in previous years, met by the Italian Gov-
ernment.
A special effort was made to increase the rate of
construction of popular housing for which the de-
mand showed no signs of slackening. A total of
2,000 million lire was allocated from the Zone’s
budget and 1,133 apartments were completed or
nearly completed during the course of the year.
The maximum assistance possible was also given
to private initiative in this sphere.
Movement through the Zone’s Displaced Per-
sons’ camps was on a much reduced scale, arrivals
totalling 2,018 and departures 2,416. The Camp
population at the end of the year stood at 3,924.
I am most grateful to the Intergovernmental Com-
mittee for European Migration which, with
already established WVelfare Organizations, ren-
dered valuable assistance.
Sectlon l—The Economic Sltuatlon
1. DOLLAR ALLocA'nous
At the end of June 1952, the Mutual Security
Agency (MsA) Mission in Trieste was closed, and
the Zone was included in the sphere of the MSA
Mission to Italy.
During the year a total of 910,052 dollars from
the balance of allocations under the former Euro-
pean Recovery Programme were used, principally
for the importation of bread grains from the
United States.
The Italian Government provided a total of 11.1
million dollars, compared with approximately 7.5
million dollars in 1951, for the purchase of a wide
variety of necessary imports from the dollar area.
The chief of these were crude mineral oil, bread
grains, iron and steel, and non-ferrous metals.
In June an agreement was reached with the
Italian Government whereby the latter assumed
the responsibility of supplying the Allied Military
Government’s requirements of bread grains at a
price that would ensure the continuation of the
controlled price of bread and pasta in the Zone.
ERP/MSA imports are shown at Appendix B, and
Eurchases with dollars provided by the Italian
overnment at Appendix B1.
2. COST OF LIVING
The cost of living again rose slightly during the
year. The index (1938=100) which stood at
4,964 in January, rose to 5,148 in April, and after
receding in the course of the summer to 5,000 had
returned to the April ﬁgure at the end of the year.
The monthly average was 5,055 as compared with
4,892 in 1951. The index for clothing declined
from 6,640 in January to 5,449 in December, thus
reversing the trend recorded in the early months
of 1951, when it was increasing in consequence of
a general rise in world prices of raw materials.
The cost of housing advanced from 766 to 970, re-
ﬂectin a further legal increase in rents. The cost
of foodstuffs, utilities and miscellaneous items fol-
lowed approximately the trend of the General
Index.

ture in lire of the typical family on the various
items that go to make up the cost of living index,
