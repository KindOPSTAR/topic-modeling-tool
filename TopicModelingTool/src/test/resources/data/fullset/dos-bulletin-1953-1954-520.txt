during the past 2 or 3 years, articularly in its
attacks against the merchant c ass. It may also
be due to the fact that several of the Southeast
Asian states, where most of the overseas Chinese
are concentrated and form potent minorities, have
taken measures to discourage local Chinese politi-
cal activity and have increased their efforts to
integrate these alien communities with the in-
digenous population. To the extent that such
measures are successful they will also tend to
diminish the support which the Republic of China
can ex ect to receive from the overseas Chinese.
Nevert eless, these communities remain an im-
portant potential source of moral and ﬁnancial aid
to the cause of Chinese freedom, and of strength
in the countries in which they reside.
Our Use of Freedom
In these few minutes I have tried to describe
for on the main elements in the China scene as
we ace it today. It is in the light of these ele-
ments that our polic toward China is formulated.
On the wisdom, rmness, and consistency of
this policy will depend in large measure the ability
of the free nations in Asia to maintain their free-
dom, and the ultimate hope of the Chinese people
to regain theirs.
In view of the situation on the Chinese main-
land toda , we have no choice but to maintain
strong mi itary forces at home and in the Paciﬁc,
and to assist other nations in the Far East, in-
cluding Free China, to build up their defenses,
if freedom is to be preserved.
The ultimate success of our policy toward
China, or toward any area of the world for that
matter, does not rest merely on the preservation
of freedom, however, but also on our constructive
utilization of freedom. Secretary Dulles has said:
The fundamental, on our side, is the richness—spiritual,
intellectual and material—that freedom can produce and
the irresistible attraction it then sets up.
I think it is signiﬁcant that Mr. Dulles put
spiritual richness ﬁrst. The most constructive
use to which we can put our freedom is the de-
velopment of spiritual richness. Freedom thus
used will exert its irresistible attraction in the
great struggle for the hearts and minds of men
in which we are engaged.
But if this is true, it behooves us Americans to
give profound attention to our own s iritual
foundations. As a Nation we must fol ow the
example of the man described in the eighth chapter
of Matthew, who built his house upon a rock. We
know that the Communists are building their
house on the sands of atheism, materialism, and
the degradation of the human spirit, and great
will be the fall thereof. But we must beware
lest our house fall too. We must build it upon
rock—the rock of faith. This is the consideration
which transcends in importance all other elements
in the formulation of our China policy.
U.S.-.lapanese Frlendship
by Walter S. Robertson
Assistant Secretary for Far Eastern A ﬂair-s ‘
The friendship between Japan and the United
States is 100 years old today. The magniﬁcent
stone lantern—itself three times that age—which
stands here beside us was given to our capital city
by the people of the capital city of Japan to com-
memorate the event With which that friendship
began. That event was the conclusion of the treaty
of Kanagawa, which was signed for the United
States by Commodore Matthew C. Perry.
It is conventional to point out that the visit of
Commodore Perry’s squadron to the harbor of
Uraga brought to an end the long period of
Ja an’s seclusion.
erhaps it may also, however, be said to have
foreshadowed the end of our own detachment
from world affairs. From the event of precisely
100 years ago that we are celebrating today may
well be dated the synchronous rise of J a an and
the United States to the condition of wor d pow-
ers. This is a condition our two peoples have by
no means entire] desired or always enjoyed. The
isolation to whic we both clung in the past out of
suspicion and fear of more powerful nations across
the seas has never entire] lost its attractions for
us. When the trials an difﬁculties of decision
that go with cat nationhood have sorely beset us,
we have 100 ed back with nostalgia upon the
happy days when it seemed possible to exclude
the world from our shores.
For both countries, however, isolation has
always been a vain dream. The character of the
Japanese and American peoples—their capacity
for hard work, their vigor, their ingenuity and
scientiﬁc a titudes—and the stimulus given to the
exercise ofp these qualities b the character of the
lands the two peoples inha it made certain that
the two countries would win places of inﬂuence
in the world and would hear great responsibility
for the future of 20th century civilization.
Since the bearing of such responsibility is so
notably the common destiny of our two nations
today, each people can be grateful that it has
the other for its friend.
The long association of Japan and the United
States has been marked b outstanding acts of
generosity on both sides. ach people has helped
the other when natural disaster has struck. It
has been marked also b one tragic and terrible
conﬂict. But all our s ared experiences, happy
and unhappy together, have, in their ultimate
effect, tended to draw us together. I believe it can
fairly be said that our two peoples have come
to understand each other. This understanding
bridges the vast waters of the Paciﬁc and a great
