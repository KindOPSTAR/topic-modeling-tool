to cover Lend-Lease (now settled) stockpile and
economic warfare urchases; credits from the
Maritime Commissmn (payments completed) ;
Surplus Pro erty Administration (now settled ,
and Export- mport Bank (payments two-thir s
completed) ; as well as both loans and grants under
F 0A (originally MsA, ECA, and Greek-Turkish
Aid) for purposes of economic develo ment, in-
cluding technlcal assistance. Meanwhi e, the In-
ternational Bank for Reconstruction and Develop-
ment (in which the U.S. holds a 32 percent
interest) extended loans for complementary de-
velopment projects, completed an overall economic
survey wit emphasis on investment possibilities,
and lent funds and advice toward the establish-
ment of an industrial development bank which can
be called the ﬁrst private institution in the Middle
East to have adopted the principles of investment
looking to the needs of the area.2 The total U.S.
Government investment in Turkey comes to
roughly $300 million in the form of grants for
defense su port, including technical assistance,
and $90 million in loans.
The Turkish Republic had launched a program
of social and economic development some 20 years
before the American Government assistance came
on the scene, and this in many ways made the task
of economic cooperation easier and more fruitful
than it has been so far with most of the other
countries in the area. No attempt will be made
here to measure the results of this coo eration, but
it is enerally accepted that it has he ped Turkey
deve op a markedly stronger economic and social
base with consequent advantages to the United
States and the rest of the free world. The latest
manifestation of Turkey’s new strength is her
strikingly progressive new investment law, assed
in January.8 This in itself while basica ly an
accomplishment of the Turks, is a product of
U.S.—Turkish Government cooperation, since the
law is based on recormnendatlons by the group
headed by Clarence Randall who went to Turkey
under FOA auspices for the purpose, not long be-
fore he undertook an assignment for the Presxdent
to complete the more universal report which has
recently been issued.
Technical Assistance
With res ect to the other countries of the Mid-
dle East, w at are the ty es of direct government
economic cooperation? robably the most widely
known today is technical assistance. Bilateral
technical assistance programs are under way in
Iran, Israel, Ethiopia, Liberia, and all the inde-
pendent Arab States except Syria and Yemen.
Congressional appropriations for these programs
were as follows: $5 million, ﬁscal year 1951; $45

million, ﬁscal year 1952; $51 million, ﬁscal year
1953; and $34 million, ﬁscal year 1954; or a total
of $135 million.
The largest beneﬁciary of these technical assist-
ance funds has been Iran, which was apportioned
a proximately $24 million of the $51 million for
t nese countries in the ﬁscal year 1953 and received
roughly 175 technicians of the 600 then working
in the area.
The next largest beneﬁciary is Egypt, which
was apportioned ap roximately $13 million in
ﬁscal 1953. Ten mi ion of this was the U.S. con-
tribution to an Egyptian-Amnican Rural Im-
provement Fund to which the E ptian Govern-
ment contributed the equivalent 0 more than $16
million. The work is centered in two provinces,
Beheira and Fayoum, and involves reclamation
work as well as agricultural, health, educational,
and other associated projects. Other allotments
in the area, including Israel, were small, none
more than $3 million in 1953. Some of the funds
were spent for regional purposes, notably locust
contro and the American University of Beirut.
General agreements, long since negotiated with
all the countries receiving technical assistance, set
forth conditions laid down in the Mutual Security
Act. They include provisions for the supplying
and publication of essential information pertain-
ing to the programs, though Moscow radio has
at times re resented them as secret agreements
under whicli capitalist America seeks to starve
the countries concerned into submission to impe-
rialism. The agreements also include language
from section 511 (b) of the law which requires
aid recipients to agree in writing “to join in pro-
moting international understanding and good will,
and in maintaining world peace, and to take such
action as may be mutually agreed upon to elimi-
nate causes of international tension.”
In addition to the broad general agreements,
program and roject agreements are necessary
to establish U. . and local government contribu-
tions to, and the administration of, articular
projects. There are close to one hun red such
agreements in effect with Near Eastern countries,
and, together with the general agreements, they
provide the legal basis for our technical
coo eration.
\ ith respect to the projects themselves, it is
difﬁcult to single out typical ones since they vary
widely in type and degree of success. However,
Americans can take some pride in the favorable
comments they hear on such grass-roots projects
as water spreading in Jordan, the maternal and
child health clinic in Samawe, Iraq, or the anti-
malarial DDT-spraying in many sectors of Iran.
There are many other signiﬁcant projects of eco-
nomic cooperation in the ﬁeld of technical assist-
ance—the Litani River Project, the Saudi Arabian
Monetary Agency, the Miri Sirf teams, etc.

Security Act by Congress last summer marked
