major proportion to other agencies of the United
Nations w ich have rendered assistance to under-
developed areas, such as the Fao, W110, and
UNESCO.“ This was also true of UNICEF, which
by 1951—1952 had shifted its emphasis from Eu-
rope to underdeveloped areas to such an extent
that 88.4 percent of its funds went to Africa, Asia,
the Eastern Mediterranean, and Latin America.
Congress appropriated $9,814,333 to UNICEF in
1953, by who time the United States had already
contributed some $87,416,667 to its humanitarian
work. The United States joined with other
United Nations members on October 6, 1953 in
placing Umcnr on a permanent basis.“
Some Summary Observations
Such were the broad and complex, as well as the

American ideals abroad by practicing and think-

day of the year.”" In his State of the Union
messa e to the Congress on January 7, 1954,
Presi ent Eisenhower sketched out a broad and
balanced policy for South Asia and the Middle
East, in which he bespoke the necessity of main-
taining technical assistance and declared: “"

place in free nations which are emonstrating
their ability to progress through democratic meth-

dictatorial methods and bac ard course of events
in Communist China. In these continuing efforts
the free peoples of South Asia can be assured of
the sup ort of the United States.
“In t 1e Middle East where tensions and serious
problems exist. we will show sympathetic and im-
partial friendship.”
