ship. Its outcome is oing to have the greatest
signiﬁcance for us, and possibly for a long time
into the future.
We have here a sort of cork in the bottle, the
bottle bein the great area that includes Indonesia,
Burma, T iailand, all of the surrounding areas
of Asia with its hundreds of millions of eople,
and its geographical location that contro 3 lines
of communication, to say nothing of the great
products of the region, some of which we must
ave.
Moreover, it is a re ion with which the newly
formed and democratic ty e of overnment in
Japan must trade. If it is enied t e opportunity
to trade with that area, how can Japan with its
85 million people ever develo into a civilization
that we would consider depen able, in that it also
tried to live in the concept of di nity of the human
and according to the precepts of free government?
And then we turn our eyes to Geneva, and we
see representatives of great—and some antag-
onistic—powers meeting there, trying to arrive
at some situation that at least we could call a
modus vivendi. We do not hope, I think, very
soon to have the type of understanding that we
believe we can ultimately develop among ourselves
as to great issues. But we would hope that the
logic of today’s situation would appeal to all
peoples, re rdless of their ruthlessness, so that
they woul see the futility of depending u on
war, or the threat of war, as a means of sett ing
international difﬁculty.
That conference is meeting in the terms of
another great development of our time—the atomic
age, which has so greatly increased the destructive
power of weapons that we sometimes visualize in
a single destructive and surprise attack almost a
decisive act in the event of an outbreak of
hostilities.
In all these things we must, of course, prevent
ourselves always from overexa erating danger
just as we refuse to become comp acent because 0
our historical position of geogra hic isolation.
We do look at them seriously. am sure that
every American that I know looks at them seri-
ously. But I am certain also that America does
not forget the power that is concentrated in the
faith that we have, in the character of our govern-
ment, the character of the system under which we
live, and our conﬁdence that by putting our shoul-
ders to the wheel, we can pull through any
difﬁculty.
The great problem of this meeting this week is
time, so that it does not become a major catas-
trophe but that we do adhere to the old principle,
“A stitch in time saves nine.” But as we think
about all of these crises in the world, and their
effect upon us, it does illustrate emphatically a
doctrine by which the Chamber of Commerce has
long lived—that no nation can live alone. We are
dependent upon others, as they are dependent upon
us, a truth that you have well exempliﬁed in all
your actions for many years, including your sup-
port of the United Nations.
Admittedly an imperfect instrument for the
settlement of these great difﬁculties, and for the
elimination of these great threats of danger, it is
still a forum where the world can still talk instead
of ﬁght. And that, in itself, is a great advance.
It has, in my opinion, accomplished so much in
the late years that, because the things it has re-
tvlrlanted have not happened, we sometimes over 00k
em.
I think our attitude toward the United Nations
should be support, and betterment, and improve-
ment.
Now, because we do have the purpose in this
world of promoting peace, of better understand-
ing, of starting by promoting this understanding
among nations who are disposed to be friendly to
us—the nations still independent—there is one
truth we must always remember. I can put it in
military terms: You can do nothing positive in a
campaign unless you have a ﬁrm base from which
to start.
In the same way the United States can do
nothin positive in the form of leading the world
towar cooperative security, unless it IS ﬁrm and
conﬁdent at home.
And so the legislative programs that are sub-
mitted to the Congress by the executive depart-
ments, that are carefully worked out with con-
sultations with eople such as ourselves, and
with agricultural: ﬁnancial, and abor organiza-
tions throughout the country, and other people,
have as their pur ose a ﬁrm, sound economy at
home and reasona le, enlightened policies abroad.
In this forei ﬁeld there is just one item to
which I shoul like to call your attention this
morning: the Report of the Randall Commission,2
and the message placing it before the Congress
for suitable action.‘
The point I want to make is this: It is a mod-
erate program—if you like, a middle-of-the-road
program. It attempts to evaluate, and understand
and recognize, the needs of certain types of indus-
tries at home, at the same time that it recognizes
the great and cryin need for sound relationshi s
with our friends abroad. The additional trut ,
that we cannot forever be an Atlas, and through
gifts and grants and loans—it has become, almost,
grants—su porting the rest of the world. But
there mustlbe a method worked out by which with
mutual proﬁt to all of us, trade can go ahead,
strengthening their economies and their stand-
ards, as ours are strengthened. Recognizing that
adjustments and certain sacriﬁces have to be made
to bring this about, it also recognizes that there
is no sacriﬁce here implied or involved that is
half as great—a twentieth as great—as the risk
of bringing about a falling apart of cooperative
security and increasing the danger of war.
