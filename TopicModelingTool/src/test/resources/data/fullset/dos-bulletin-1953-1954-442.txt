vantage of the special resources of the free na-
tions; and which is steadily developed and
adapted to changing conditions. The funda-
mental aim of our national security policies is to
deter aggression and thereby avert a new war.
The essentials of this problem may be brieﬂy sum-
marized as follows:
1. The free nations can achieve security only
by a collective system of defense. No single na-
tion can develop alone adequate power to deter
Soviet bloc aggression a ainst its vital interests.
By providing joint faci ities and by combining
their resources, the free nations can achieve a
total strength and a ﬂexibility which can surpass
that of any potential enemy and can do so at
bearable cost.
This collective security concept is the most
highly developed in NATO. But it also em-
bodied in the Rio Pact of 1947 and, in more
limited form in various securit arrangements
in the Far East. The Turkey- akistan agree-
ment marks the beginning of up 1 ing the col-
lective security concept in the Mid)d e East. The
United Nations is moving in the same direction,
as shown by its “Uniting for Peace” Resolution.
2. In organizin their collective defense, the
free nations shou d not attempt to match the
Soviet bloc man for man and gun for . The
best wa to deter aggression is to ma e the ag-
gressor know in advance that he will suffer dam-
age outweighing what he can hope to gain. Thus
an aggressor must not be able to count upon a
sanctuary status for those resources which he does
not use in committin aggression.
3. To apply this eterrent principle the free
world must maintain and be repared to use effec-
tive means to make aggression too costly to be
tempting.
It must have the mobility and ﬂexibility to
bring collective power to bear against an enemy
on a selective or massive basis as conditions may
require. For this purpose its arsenal must in-
clude a wide range of air sea, and land power
based on both conventional and atomic weapons.
These new wea one can be used not only for stra-
tegic pur ut also for tactical urposes. The
greatest eterrent to war is the abi ity of the free
world to respond by means best suited to the par-
ticular area or circumstances. There should be a
capability for massive retaliation without delay.
I point out that the possession of that capacity
does not impose the necessity of using it in every
instance of attack. It is not our intention to turn
every local war into a general war.
4. The magnitude and duration of the present
danger and the need for ﬂexibility of means to
deter that danger make it vital to the United
States, as never before, that it have ﬁrm allies. A
ﬁrm alliance depends not merely upon documents,
although these may be important. There must
also be trust, understanding, and good will as be-
tween the free nations. This implies not merel
military commitments, but good economic and c -
tural relations as well. It is not charity on the
part of the United States to be concerned with
the economic health of other nations which help
to support the basic strategy I describe. Neither
is their good will a matter to which we can be
indifferent. All of this means that foreign policy
has assumed, as never before, a vital importance
for the security of the United States.
In the long haul the United States has a pro-
found interest in insuring that its allies and the
uncommitted areas of the free world are able to
maintain viable economic and political systems.
That is why our foreign economic policy means so
much to our own security.
