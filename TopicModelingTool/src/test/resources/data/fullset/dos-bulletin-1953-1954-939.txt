to solve the complex problems in the disarmament
ﬁeld now in anticipation of the time when agree-
ments in the political area would enable an agreed
disarmament rogram actually to be put into ef-
fect. Mr. Du les said that the U.S. was not in-
ﬂexible in its views except in insisting that any
proposals must meet the one fundamental test of
safeguards to insure the compliance of all nations
and to give adequate warning of possible evasions
or violations.
Third, President Eisenhower made his ro-
osals of December 8, 1953 at the United Natlons '
that there should oint contributions of uranium
and ﬁssionable materials to an International
Atomic Ener A ency, established under the
ac is of the he most important responsi-
bi ity of this Agency would be to devise methods
to allocate this material to serve the peaceful pur-
suits of mankind. The President made clear that
this proposal was not intended to solve all the com-
plex problems in the disarmament ﬁeld. Instead
e hoped it would initiate a new approach to these
many diﬂicult roblems. As you know, private
discussions wit the Soviet Union on this matter
have been conducted over the past months. On
May 31 the President disclosed these bilateral
conversations had not been roductive of the re-
sults we seek. He added hat the U.S. intends
to exchange views and consult with the other free
nations princi ally involved, in the belief that our
urposes and opes would survive even the most
grustrating series of talks.
The fourth major example of U.S. desire to
achieve safeguarded disarmament was our cospon-
sorship of the General Assembly resolution of No-
vember 28, 1953. This resolution provided that
the Disarmament Commission should consider
establishing a subcommittee of representatives of
the “powers principally involved’ to seek in pri-
vate an acceptable solution to the disarmament
problem. Under this resolution a subcommittee
of the Disarmament Commission has been set up
consisting of the U.S.S.R., the U.K., Canada,
France, and the U.S. This subcommittee of ﬁve
has been meeting in closed sessions in London
since May 13.

Soviet Proposltlons
To this initiative of the U.S. over the years,
how has the Soviet Union reacted? There have
been variations in the details but none in the sub-
stance of the Russian responses. First, the
USSR. has tried to get the U.N. to declare
atomic, hydro en, and other weapons of mass
destruction to e “unconditionally prohibited” by
force of the declaration alone, without adequate
safeguards to insure that the prohibition would
in fact be observed. Secondly, the USSR. has
asked the U.N. to recommend to the ﬁve permanent
members of the Security Council that they reduce
their armed forces by one-third within a year.
From what levels and to what levels this one-third
reduction would apply has not been explained, nor
how it would be accom lished. This would main-
tain or even increase t e preponderance of power
in this ﬁeld on the art of the Soviet world. And,
thirdly, the Soviet nion has tried to secure U.N.
recommendations to eliminate military, air, and
naval bases in the territories of other states, with
particular reference to NATO, on the alleged
ground that these bases increase the threat of a
new world war but actuall because they
strengthen the defensive capabi ities of the free
worl .
The United Nations has rejected all of the Soviet
ropositions over these years, recognizing them
or what they are. There is no reason to expect a
different fate for the present Soviet variation on
its old theme. In the past, they stressed banning
nuclear weapons merely by declaration. Now
they propose—again by declaration—banning the
use only of these weapons. This is sometimes re-
ferred to as a new approach by the Soviet Union.
In fact, it is really a repetition of efforts made in
the General Assembl by the U.S.S.R. in the fall
of 1950 and rejected y a substantial majority of
the U.N. The United Nations rejected it then as
the U.S. opposes it now. Our reasons are sound.
The United States believes that the disarma-
ment system for which we are working should pro-
vide for prohibition not only of the use but also of
the production of atomic and hydrogen weapons.
But we believe this can onl come about as the
result of effective safe ar s which will insure
that such agreements Will be observed. Mere dec-
larations not to use these weapons, which lack any
adequate safeguards against violations or evasions,
do not lessen the danger of war nor its destruc-
tiveness. The Soviet proposal would permit stocks
of weapons to be accumulated, while merely pro-
posin a declaration against their use which would
provi e at best the illusion and not the reality of
security.
The United States adheres to the views rec»
omized as fundamental by the United Nations,
w ich state that the whole disarmament program,
including the elimination and prohibition of
atomic weapons and major weapons adaptable to
mass destruction, should be carried out under ef-
fective international controls and in such a way
that no state would have cause to feel that its
security was in danger. The Soviet proposal for a
ban on the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons is
an eﬁ'ort to single out particular weapons and then
not to do anything more than create a paper
promise not to use these weapons. This approach
attem ts to ignore the defeat suffered by the
U.S. B. when it last made such a proposal, when
the members of the U.N. pointed out clearly that
it is aggression which is the gravest of all crimes
against peace and security, rather than the use of
any particular weapons. For its part, the United
