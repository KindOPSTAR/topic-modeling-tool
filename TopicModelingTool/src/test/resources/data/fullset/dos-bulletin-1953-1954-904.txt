is now restudying the cases of these 120. It is
anticipated that many of them have by now
changed their minds; they have taken permanent
jobs and will no longer wish to leave the United
States. Those who do will have their status given
careful review.
It is to be emphasized that none of the Chinese
in the United States has been imprisoned, detained,
or mistreated. All have enjoyed, and enjoy, com-
plete freedom of movement; they are free to com-
municate with an one and free to accept any
employment they 0 oose. The sole restriction on
those denied permission to leave is that once every
three months they must report in writin to the
Immigration Ofﬁce in the district in which they
reside their current address and occupation.
As of April 30, 1954, there were 5,242 Chinese
in the United States on student visas. Many of
these are now teachin or otherwise employed.
Since April, 1949, the nited States Government
has given ﬁnancial assistance to 3,642 Chinese stu-
dents in the United States—this with no strings
attached, so far as their de arture from the United
States was concerned. T is government aid was
in addition to substantial assmtance Chinese stu-
dents received from private citizens and organi-
zations.
STATEMENT OF JUNE 5
Press release 301 dated June 5
In an effort to secure the release of United States
citizens at present im risoned or otherwise de-
tained in Communist China, U. Alexis Johnson,
American Ambassador to Czechoslovakia and a
member of the U.S. dele tion at the Geneva Con-
ference, today accom anied Humphrey Trevelyan,
British Chargé d’A aires at Pei ing, to a meeting
with a member of the Chinese Climmunist delega-
tion.
As the United States does not recognize Com-
munist China, the British Mission at Peiping has
made many representations in behalf of the im-
prisoned or detained Americans, none of which
has been acted upon. At Geneva Mr. Trevelyan
has conferred with members of the Chinese Com-
munist delegation on this problem. In the course
of these conversations, the Chinese suggested to
him that progress in this matter could only be
facilitated through direct contact with a member
of the U. S. delegation.
The United States Government has made the
decision to authorize informal United States par-
ticipation in this meeting because of its obligation
to protect the welfare of its citizens. It intends
to leave no stone unturned in its endeavors to se-
cure the release of American citizens Whom the
Chinese Communists hold. At least 32 American
civilians are known to be in prison and others have
been unable to secure exit permits. There are also
950
Air Force and other military personnel who are
believed to be under detention.
United States participation in these conversa-
tions in no way implies United States accordance
with any measure of diplomatic recognition to the
Red Chinese regime.
U.S. Policy on Guatemala
News Conference Statement by Secretary Dulles
Press release 310 dated June 8
At his news conference on June 8, Secretary
Dulles was asked the current status of consulta-
tions going on with regard to Guatemala and the
prospects for a Foreign Ministers Conference on
the subject. The Secretary replied:
\Vell, there is going on an exchange of views
with reference to the desirability of action which
was forecast by the Caracas Declaration which
was adopted last March 1 and subsequent develop-
ments in the way of this surreptitious shipment of
arms into Guatemala from behind the Iron Cur-
tain.z That has necessitated a consideration by
the American States as to whether or not a meet-
ing of the American States would be desirable.
There has been no decision taken as yet.
Asked whether the United States favored the
holding of a Foreign Ministers Conference to
deal with the uestion of Communists in Guate-
mala, M r. Dulles replied .-
VVe have not ourselves come to any ﬁnal conclu-
sion, because we believe that a ﬁnal conclusion
should be arrived at only after we have had an
exchange of views with the other sister Republics.
lVe are disposed to feel that the situation is one
which calls for such a meeting, but, as I say, we
are keeping our minds open on the subject until
we have heard whatever arguments there might
be on the other side of the matter.
Mr. Dulles was asked whether he had any com-
ment on the suggestion by the President of Guate-
mala that he met with President Eisenhower to
iron out differences between the two countries.
The Secretary replied:
There is a persistent effort by the authorities in
Guatemala to represent the present problem there
as primarily a problem between Guatemala and
the United States relating to the United Fruit
Company. That is a totally false presentation
of the situation. There is a problem in Guatemala.
but it is a problem in Guatemala which affects the
