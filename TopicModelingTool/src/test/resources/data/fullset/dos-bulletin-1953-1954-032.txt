stitution, t e Committee adopted a resolution
recommending that member governments acce t
the Constitution at the earliest ssible date. T 0
Constitution when ﬁnally in orce will ive the

rovisional Committee whose continuous existence
is dependent upon an annual decision of the
member governments.
Sltuatlon In "on; Kong
The Director brought to the attention of the
Committee the special situation in Hong Kong,
which is the exit oint for refugees from Shanghai.
They arrive in ong Kong on special courtesy
visas issued to them by various Western European
countries and remain until the Committee can
move them overseas for ermanent resettlement.
About 15,000 are now in ong Kong; they leave
the city for overseas at the rate of about 400 a
month.
The Director explained that the International
Refugee Organization Trust Fund previously
available for the movement of these refugees would
be exhausted by December 31, 1953. He conse-
quently made a special appeal to the overnment
members for the contribution of free unds to the
operational fund in the amount of approximately
$2 million in order that the movement out of Hong
Kong might be continued in 1954. Pending the
receipt of contributions speciﬁcally allocated for
this purpose, the Director requested authority to
apply $900,000 remaining in the Committee’s
hands as the unspent balance of the special Ino
payments in 1952 for the movement of 12,000
refugees turned over to the Committee when Ino
eeaSed operations. The movement of all of these
refugees had been accomplished. The Committee
by specific resolution appealed to the government
members for funds for this purpose, and author-
ized the Director to apply the balance of $900,000
originally received from IRO to the movement of
refugees from Shanghai and Hong Kong pending
the receipt of new funds for this pur )ose.
The representative of the Allied Military Gov-
ernment at Trieste, present as an observer, ad-
dresed the Committee on the continuing necessity
of securing the early resettlement of some 4,500
Eastern European and Yugoslav refu remain-
ing in Trieste. A trust fund of a mi lion dollars
for this purpose was made available to the Com-
mittee during 1953. The Committee by resolu-
tion appealed to the member governments to pro-
vide resettlement opportunities for the refugees
remaining in Trieste. Reports were received in-
formally during the session that the Committee’s
appeal had already opened up new possibilities of
emigration, resulting from the undertakings of a
number of immigration countries to send recruit-
(iing missions to Trieste at the earliest possible
ate.
The Director’s report on the meeting of land
settlement experts at Florence from September
28 to October 2, 1953, was followed by statements
of a general nature on the sub'ect b a number of
representatives of the Latin merican countries.
The representative of Paraguay gave a detailed
description of a plan for land settlement which
his vernment has in preparation. At the end
of t e discussion a brief resolution was adopted
requesting the Director to intensify his efforts in
carrying out the terms of para raph 3 of Resolu-
tion No. 36 adopted at the ourt session. During
the discussion the United States representative
restated the United States position that the
United States contribution to the Committee is
available onl for the movement of migrants and
for servic c osely related to movements and that
the United States cannot support participation
by the Committee in the ﬁnancing or management
of land settlement projects.
On balance the government representatives at
the session were optimistic that the reduced quota
of movement, 117,600 for 1954, could be achieved
during that period. It was expected also that the
services undertaken b the Committee to facilitate
the rocessing and piiicement of migrants would
pro uce g‘reater results in 1954. In the develop-
ment of t ese services, which include special voca-
tional training, language training, and the wider
distribution of information concerning opportuni-
ties and conditions of living in the receiving coun—
tries, the Committee is preparin the groundwork
for lar er movements in 1955. ie Committee has
learne from experience that to increase the vol-
ume of movements to receiving countries, particu-
larly in Latin America, great attention must be
given to the development of new and improved
methods of selection, trade testing, and rocessing,
and in the reception, placement, and istribution
of migrants after arrival at the port. In many
areas of potential movement, the foregoin serv-
ices are either inadequate or nonexistent an must
be painstakingly developed if movement is to take
place. Some governments which have developed
these services to a high standard of efficiency may
be induced to share their experience with other
governments through the exchange of trained
personnel.
