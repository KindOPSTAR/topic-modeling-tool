TEXT OF APPLI CATIDN
F ollowin is the text of the application ad-
dressed to the Registrar of the International Court
of Justice at The Hague, Netherlands, by the De-
partment’s Legal Adviser:
F annuaar 16, 1954
Sm:
1. This is a written application, in accordance
with the Statute and Rules of the Court, submitted
by the Government of the United States of Amer-
ica institutin proceedings against the Govern-
ment of the Union of Soviet Socialist Re ublics
on account of certain actions of the latter overn-
ment, in concert with the Government of the
Hungarian People’s Republic. A separate writ-
ten application IS bein submitted by the Govern-
ment of the United tates of America simulta-
neously herewith instituting proceedings against
the Government of the Hungarian Peo les -
public on account of the same matter. he Gov-
ernment of the United States of America requests
that so far as it may be convenient and proper
to do so the two applications and the pr '
thereon be considered and dealt with together.
The subject of the dispute and a succlnct state-
ment of the facts and grounds on which the claim
of the Government of the United States of Amer-
ica is based are set forth in two notes, one de-
livered to the Soviet Government on March 17,
1953 and one delivered to the Hungarian Govern-
ment on the same day; the note to the Hungarian
Government was incorporated by reference in the
note to the Soviet Government, the note to the
Soviet Government was incorporated by reference
in the note to the Hungarian Government, and
each of the two Governments received from the
United States Government a co y of the note ad-
dressed by the United States Glhvernment to the
other Government. Copies of both notes are at-
tached to this application as an annex.
2. The United States Government notes that
the present dispute concerns matters of the char-
acter speciﬁed in Article 36 (2) of the Statute of
the Court, including subdivisions (a) through
(d). As will be seen from the annex, the legal
dispute of the United States Government with the
Soviet Govermnent involves the interpretation of
the Treaty of Peace signed at Paris February 10,
1947, to which the United States Government, the
Soviet Government and the Hun arian Govern-'
ment are parties; the Treaty of Friendship, Com-l
merce and Consular Rights, signed at Washington ;
June 24, 1925, which was in effect during the
period relevant to this dispute and to which the
United States Government and the Hungariani
Government are parties; numerous questions of
international law, as set forth in Part II of each
of the annexed notes; numerous issues of fact
which if established would constitute breaches of
international obligations by the Hungarian Gov-
ernment; and questions of the nature and extent
of reparation to be made to the United States
Government by the Hungarian Government for
these breaches.
The United States Government, in ﬁlin this
application with the Court, submits to the ourt’s
'urisdiction for the purposes of this case. The
un arian Government appears not to have ﬁled
any eclaration with the Court thus far, and al-
though it was invited to do so by the United
States Government in the Note annexed hereto
it has not made any responsive reply to the in-
vitation. The Hungarian Government, however,
is qualiﬁed to submit to the jurisdiction of the
Court in this matter and may upon notiﬁcation
of this ap lication b the Registrar, in accordance
with the IRules of t e Court, take the necessa
steps to enable the Court’s jurisdiction over bot
parties to the dispute to be conﬁrmed.
Thus the United States Government founds the
jurisdiction of this Court on the foregoing con-
siderations and on Article 36 (1) of the Statute.
3. The claim of the Government of the United
States of America is brieﬂy that the Government
of the Hun arian Peoples Republic in concert
with and ai ed and abetted by the Government of
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on No-
vember 19, 1951, wilfully and unlawfully caused
to be seized a United States Air Force C—47 type
aircraft together with its crew of four American
nationals and its contents, driven over Hungary
by winds unknown to the crew; that thereafter
both Governments engaged in unlawful actions
against the crew and against the United States
With respect to the incident, constituting both
serious Violations of existing treaties as well as
manifest denials of justice and other international
wrongs. For these breaches of international 0b-
ligation the United States has demanded and
demands monetary and other reparation from the
Hungarian Government. The Soviet Government
has sought to 'ustify some of its conduct by Ar-
ticle 22 of the reaty of Peace to which reference
has been made, a contention which the United
States Government denies.
As the United States Government, in further
leadings herein, will more fully set forth, the
United States Government proposes that the is-
sues of law and fact in this dispute be heard and
decided by the Court in accordance with its Stat-
ute and Rules; that the Court decide that the
accused Governments are jointly and severally
liable to the United States for the damage caused;
that the Court award damages in favor of the
United States Government against the Soviet
Government in the sum of $637,894.11, with inter-
est, as demanded in the annexed notes; that the
Court determine the nature and extent of other
reparation and redress, which the Court may deem
ﬁt and proper; and that the Court make the neces-
sary orders and awards, including an award of
costs, to effectuate its determinations.
