more often to offer constructive and helpful sug-
gestions on various economic and social problems.
One of the most laborious and difﬁcult tasks
confronti each session of the Council is the
handlingrclﬁ the large number of petitions which,
under the charter, come directly to the Council
without any intervening action. Over 250 peti-
tions were laid before the Council at this session.
A special Standing Committee of six members-—
three administering and three nonadministering—
spends weeks in attempting to classify these peti-
tions in the order of their urgency and importance,
and also on the basis of the nature of the com-
plaint, whether individual or general. In some
instances the written petition is supplemented,
if the Council agrees, with the grant of an oral
hearing to the petitioner. Sometimes a whole
tribe may raise the funds necessary to send one
of its number to New York to appear before the
Council. The right of petition, of course is
regarded by most people as a sacred right. And
though no one wishes to abridge this right, the
prob em of handling a ﬂood o petitions which
emanate from all of the 11 trust territories is
requiring the Council’s serious attention.
At this session three African petitioners from
British Togoland, in a most effective manner, pre-
sented the case for that territory becoming a part
of the Gold Coast. At previous sessions several
petitioners from the same region had appeared to
present the opposite case, namely, that the terri-
tory should not become a part of the Gold Coast
but should be uniﬁed with French Togoland, just
east of it. The convincing way in which these
petitioners presented their respective points of
view has shown many members how complex the
question is and how impossible it is to apply any
doctrinaire solution.
Constltutlonal Changes In West Afrch
As stated before, one of the principal subjects
discussed at this session was the effect which self-
government in the Gold Coast and Nigeria is hav-
ing upon the neighboring trust territories.
A lance at the map of West Africa will show
that t e Trust Territory of British Togoland is a
narrow strip not over 100 miles wide which is con-
tiguous wit the eastern border of the Gold Coast
and with which it has been administered since
1920. The Gold Coast now has an African Prime
Minister, Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, and its Cabinet
is African except for three members. It is ex-
pected that shortly the government will be com-
pletely African and that the territory will be ov-
erned as a unitary state. In 1953 the Gold oast
Government declared its intention of requesting
the administering authority to grant it independ-
ent status within the British Commonwealth of
Nations.
British Togoland, it is quite generally conceded,
is too small an entity to maintain an independent
existence. It must almost certainly be associated
in some way with the Gold Coast or with French
Togoland. This has been obvious for some years.
But with the near realization of an independent
status for the Gold Coast the problem has become
one of urgency. Moreover, since the territory has
been administered as an integral part of the Gold
Coast and since the latter has already become vir-
tually self-governing, the British Government, as
the trust power, has necessarily become more and
more the indirect administrator. And this raises
the question whetl 'r the trusteeship agreement
must not either s00. be terminated or in certain
res ects revised.
he Trusteeshi Council was informed that an
election for an a -African Legislative Assembly
for the two territories will be held this Ma on
the basis of universal suﬂ'rage; the voters in rit-
ish Togoland will have an op ortunity to choose
between candidates standing tldr integration with
the Gold Coast and those favoring uniﬁcation with
French Togoland. This election will not decide
the future status of the territory, but it will un-
doubtedly ive a clear indication of what the ma-
jority of t e eople want. It will, in the words
of the Unite States delegate, Mason Sears, “be
tantamount to the exercise of self-determination.”
Turning to the Trust Territory of British
Cameroon which is conti ous to Nigeria on the
east, a simi ar situation eXIsts. In Nigeria a new
constitution is bein drawn up which will make of
that country a sel - overning federated state in
the near future. It as been roposed that three
semi-autonomous regions wil comprise Nigeria,
namely, the Northern Region, the Western Region,
and the Eastern Region. This raises the question
of the relationship of the Trust Territory of Brit-
ish Cameroons to the federated territory of Ni-
ria, with which it has been administered under
t e trusteeship agreement. That is, would the
trust territory be associated with Nigeria as a
fourth region or in some other way? But the
problem was explained to the Council as being
even more complex. In the northern part of the
British Cameroons, the tribal relationships are
such as to bind the inhabitants close] with the
Northern Region. The Southern ameroons,
however, constitute a more politically developed
people who have expressed a desire to be a sep-
arate region of Nigeria.
From the foregoing, it is clear that the im-
portant constitutional chan es which are taking
place in these two British a 'nistered territories
confront the administering authority and the
Trusteeship Council with the necessity of taking
far-reaching decisions.
In the Cameroons under French administration
a different development is taking place. This
territory forms part of the French Union as an
“Associated Territory.” The indigenous inhabi-
tants are citizens of the French Union and as such
enjoy the rights established by the French Con~
