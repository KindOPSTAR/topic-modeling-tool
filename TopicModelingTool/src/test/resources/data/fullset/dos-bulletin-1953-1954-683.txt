trust powers but also many others, argues for or-
derly evolution of the colonial system. The con-
sequently tend to stress the economic, socia , and
educational foundations for stable government
and point with pride and satisfaction to the build-
ing of roads, h droelectric plants, hospitals,
sc ools, railways, arbors, and agricultural devel-
o ments. The ﬁrst group, however, ﬁnds it
difﬁcult to express much appreciation or com-
mendation for these activities. Indeed, this group
usual] opposes resolutions which would commend
the a ministerin powers for such achievements
slince, they say, t is is no more than their normal
ut .
Ii this situation the position of the United
States, itself a trust power, is not an easy or en-
viable one. Instinctively, Americans dislike the
idea of any people being ruled by an alien au-
thority. We tend, therefore, to press for the at-
tainment of self-government without undue dela
yet with an appreciation of the necessity for buil -
ing the requisite foundations lest a premature self-
government result in chaos or make the people an
easthprey for Communist imperialism.
e olicy of the United States was clearly
stated y Secretary Dulles in his statement of
November 18, 1953,2 when he summed up the posi-
tion as follows:
There is no slightest wavering in our conviction that
the orderly transition from colonial to self-governing
status should be carried resolutely to a completion.
This has been the guiding line of the United States
delegation in the Trusteeship Council, and each
prob em confronting it has been viewed in the
ight of this concept of orderly transition. This,
it will be seen, is a positive policy and does not
mean that the United States will merely take a
middle-of-the-road position on the basis of
expediency.

It is in the li ht of this background that the full
signiﬁcance 0 the principal highli hts of the
thirteenth session of the Council may seen.
Almost everyone is aware of the remarkabl
rapid advances toward self-government whic
have taken place in West Africa, articularly in
the Gold Coast and Nigeria. As t ese territories
border upon or are close to four trust territories,
and as two of these trust territories are adminis-
tered to ether with the neighboring colonies as
permit by the trusteeship agreements, these de-
velopments are having a profound effect upon the
trust territories themselves. These will be more
fully discussed later in this article. The Council
also examined the conditions in two trust terri-
tories in East Africa—Ruanda-Urundi and Tan-
ganyika—where the situation, from the pint of
view of political developments, is quite iﬂ'erent
from that in West Africa.

The Council of course, does not conﬁne its ex-
amination solely to olitical developments but, as
is called for under the charter, concerns itself also
with economic social, and educational advance-
ment of the inhabitants of trust territories. The
annual reports of the administering owers, often
running into hundreds of pages on t ese subjects,
are the basis for this examination. And it has be-
come customary to have a special representative
from the territory itself appear before the Council
to su ply the latest su plementary data on all these
deve opments. In a dition, the Council has a
disinterested report from its own Visiting Mission
which visits each territory every 3 years. Each
individual member of the Council poses a number
of questions and after 2 or 3 days of this proce-
dure each, in turn, states the views of his delega-
tion as to the progress, or lack of it, made in each
territory.
Naturally one would not expect the administer-
ing or trust power to 've a bad account of its own
stewardship. It wil , however, often indicate
some of the more diﬂicult problems with which the
territory is confronted and with which the ad-
ministration has been attemptin to cope. Some
administering authorities, and t e United States
is one of these, have invited members of the Coun-
cil to 've them the beneﬁt of any constructive or
helpfiﬁl su gestions drawn from their experience
which might aSSist in the solution of such roblems.
Certain members of the Council have con free
in oﬁ'ering su gestions. This is true of members
like India which, while standing in principle for
early liquidation of the whole system, has help-
fully drawn on its own experience in dealing with
such questions as illiteracy, malaria control, road-
building, etc. It is when the Council functions
in this way that its utility is most apparent. This
constructive approach has not been taken by the
Soviet delegation at this or at revious sessions
of the Council. Instead that de egation has con-
tinued to press its usual line of attack against the
trust powers, charging among other thin that
they were continuing to exploit the inhaEi’tants,
paying them low wages, paying low prices for
cocoa, rubber, coffee, and other ex orts, rovidin
insuﬁicient educational and healt faci ities, an
generally keeping them in a backward condition
in order the better to control them. These Soviet
strictures have invariably followed the same pat-
tern throughout the Council’s 13 sessions and have
been so obviously exaggerated as to lose most of
their effect, even upon the delegations who regard
themselves as vigorously anticolonial. Their ef-
fects, however, may be another matter in the terri-
tories, where uninformed opinion may give them
more credence than they deserve.
Among the newl elected members at the thir-
teenth session, besi es India, were Syria and Haiti.
Both took an active part in the discussions, Syria
tending to be more sharply critical while Haiti,
though often trenchant in its criticism, tended
