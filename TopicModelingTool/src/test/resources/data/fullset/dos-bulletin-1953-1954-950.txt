steps taken by the executive branch with respect
to the encouragement of international travel.
One of the most signiﬁcant recent developments
has been the emphasis which the President laced
on the expansion of international travel 1n his
messa e to the Congress of March 30 on the sub-
ject 0 foreign economic policy.3 After stressing
the cultural, social, and economic advantages to
the vghole free world of international travel, be
state :
I shall instruct the appropriate agencies and depart-
ments, at home and abroad, to consider how they can
facilitate international travel. They will be asked to take
action to simpllty governmental procedures relating to
customs, visas. passports, exchange, or monetary restric-
tions and other regulations that sometimes harass the
traveler.
A bill, H. R. 8352, was introduced b Congress-
man F relinghuysen to give effect to the one spe-
ciﬁc legislative recommendation made by the Pres-
ident in connection with international travel.
This bill would increase the duty-free allowance
for tourists from $500 to $1,000, exercisable every 6
months.
To im lement further his recommendations in
this ﬁel , the President has recently sent memo-
randa to the four principal agencies concerned
with international travel, namely, the Depart-
ments of State, Commerce, Treasury, and Justice,
requesting them to take the necessary steps to carry
out his recommendations.
As a further follow-up on this section of the
President’s message I have asked the Departments
of Agriculture, and of Health, Education, and
Welfare to reexamine the provisions of the plant
and animal quarantine laws and the Pure Food
and Drug Act, and the administration therefor,
to determine whether there are any inequities in
the application of these laws to foreign commodi-
ties as compared with domestic commodities. It
is understood with the staff of each of these de-
partments that these reviews although more gen-
eral than the tourist problem do cover any aspects
of these laws or their enforcement which affect
tourists.
Consistent with the President’s emphasis on the
importance of international travel is the request
by the Department of Commerce, now pending
before the Congress, for a small amount of money
with which to reestablish an office devoted exclu-
sively to the development of tourist travel. If this
money is appropriated by the Congress, it will be
possible to do considerably more in the way of pro-
viding adequate statistics on travel, determining
what factors tend to hinder travel, reviewing for-
eign regulations and procedures with a view to
suggesting through diplomatic channels changes
in these regulations and procedures which would
facilitate travel, and so on.

Slmplllled Customs Procedures
The Bureau of Customs has instituted various
new rocedures designed to make it easier for
trave ers to pass through the United States cus-
toms. Examination of travelers’ personal luggage,
particularly that accompanying the traveler, has
been reduced to the minimum consistent with ade-
quate enforcement of our laws. 'Within the past
2 years steps have also been taken to reduce the
formalities involved when a tourist makes a pur-
chase abroad and sends it home separately. An
experiment which holds great promise has been
underway for some time in conjunction with Can-
ada. This is a procedure whereby travelers leav-
ing certain Canadian points and oin directly to
the United States are examin be ore leaving
Canada, and are thus not dela ed at all upon
reaching the United States bor er. This proce-
dure may be extended to other nearby countries if
the necessary cooperation of those countries can
be secured. At present ofﬁcials of the Treasury
Department do not think such a system would
prove feasible for the more remote countries, for
example, Western European or South American
countries. '
Representatives of this country are actively
engaged in discussions with those of other coun-
tries, both through individual meetings and
through multilateral conferences, to ﬁnd ways of
simplifying border formalities and otherwise to
facilitate international travel. We are at the pres-
ent time, for example, represented at the United
Nations Conference on Customs Formalities for
the Tem orary Importation of Private Vehicles
and for ourism. This conference is seekin to
reach agreement on a protocol to the Geneva on-
ference of 1948 for the purpose of establishin
uniform regulations coverin automobiles and
auto travel and to arrive at International a -
ment on the regulations coverin personal be ong-
in accompanying a tourist. he United States
wi 1 also shortly send its delegation to the Fifth In-
ter-American Travel Conference, to be held this
year, June 10—20, in Panama. Active considera-
tion is now being given by this Government to a
recommendation for placing tourism on the agenda
of the forthcoming Inter-American Conference of
Ministers of Finance or Economy, to .be held at
Rio de J aneiro.
In addition to discussing the problems of tourist
travel with other nations at conferences, this Gov-
ernment is now taking advantage of all opportuni-
ties as they arise to impress on other nations the
importance we attach to international travel and
to urge upon them the appropriate actions to
encourage such travel. You are no doubt aware
that the President, the Secretary of Commerce,
the Under Secretary of Commerce, the Assistant
Secretary of Commerce for International Affairs,
the Assistant Secretary of State for Economic
Affairs, and I all met with the delegation of lead-
