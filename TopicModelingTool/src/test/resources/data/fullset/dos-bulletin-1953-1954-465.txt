A. Combined Program for Spain—After 18
months of ne otiation, the United States signed
three bilateralgagreements with Spain in Septem-
ber 1953 to strengthen the defense ca abilities of
the West. These agreements cover : construc-
tion and joint use of militar bases in Spain'
military assistance; and economic aid and technical
cooperation. For the ﬁscal ear 1954, $226
million has been programed fbr military and
economic aid to S ain.
By the end of t e year, a United States Opera-
tions Mission, for economic and technical pro-
grams, and a Military Assistance Advisory Grou ,
both under the Ambassador, already were esta -
lished in Madrid and working with the Spanish
authorities to carry out the proposed programs.
ECONOMIC STRENGTH
Support to K orea.—Within 4 days of con-
gresswnal approval in August of a $200 million
emergency aid program for Korea, the Foreign
Operations Administration had dis atched initial
supplies of needed rice, barley, an cotton; later,
fertilizer and rubber were added. By the end of
1953, substantial quantities of these commodities
had arrived in Pusan harbor.
Over $400 million has been programed for
ﬁscal year 1954 to be used to assist the courageous
Korean peo le in their effort to rebuild and
strengthen t eir war-torn country. This amount
includes activities of the Foreign erations Ad-
ministration, the Department of efense, and
the United Nations Korean Reconstruction
Agency. In December 1953, an agreement was
signed with representatives of the Republic of
Korea,5 covering necessary arrangements for an
integrated program of economic recovery and
ﬁnancial stabilization.“
Bolstering Iran’s E conomy.—Iran was con-
fronted with ﬁnancial disaster at the time Prime
Minister Zahedi took ofﬁce in August 1953. To
help the new and friendly Iranian Government
through its economic crisis, the President made an
emergency grant of $45 million to Iran in Septem-
ber. Substantially all of these funds had been
obligated by the end of the year for ﬁnancing im-
ports of urgently needed commodities and for
temporary budget support. The immediate crisis
was successfully met, but Iran continued to face
a variety of deep-seated problems. The problem
of oil exports, in particular must be solved if the

country is to move toward more durable economic
strength.
Aid to Bolivia—Special programs of emer-
gency economic aid and expanded technical co-
operation were initiated for Bolivia to help the
country meet a critical situation brou ht on by
the sharp dro in world tin prices. lmost 60
ercent of Boiivia’s export trade consists of tin.
Vith its foreign exchange seriously depleted by
the loss of earnings from its main export item, the
Bolivian Government lacked the resources to
ﬁnance imports of needed food and other com-
modities in short supply.
In October 1953, $5 million worth of sur lus
wheat and wheat ﬂour were programed for s ip-
ment to Bolivia. Moreover, up to $4 million of
mutual security funds was programed for further
economic aid, including the purchase of additional
United States agricultural commodities.
In conjunction with these emergency programs,
other measures were taken to provide more basic
solutions to Bolivia’s food problems. Another $2
million was added to the technical cooperation
funds for the country, and emphasis was placed
on those projects which will most rapidly increase
Bolivia’s food production.
Recovery in Austria—The determined efforts
of the Austrian people, supported by United States
assistance during the critical postwar years, have
brought the Austrian economy to the point where
no dlrect economic aid funds are required for the
ﬁscal year 1954. Another name was thus added
to the list of Euro ean countries whose economic
progress has enabiiad them to continue building
strength without further economic aid. These
countries include Belgium, Denmark, Iceland,
Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway,
Portugal, and Sweden.
Austria’s economic progress testiﬁes to the suc-
cess of the 'oint recovery programs of Austria and
the Unite States. For example, Austrian gold
and dollar reserves increased by $95 million durin
1953 to reach a total of $238 million at the en
of the year. This represents a rise of more than
130 percent since 1951. Exports climbed from
$286 million in 1949 to an estimated $530 million
in 1953. Industrial production increased by
nearly 40 percent in the same period.
The Austrian Government, in carrying forward
its programs to increase industrial and agricul-
tural productivity, will continue to participate in
the United States technical cooperation program.
