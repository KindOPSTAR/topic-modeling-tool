Council to include in a separate section of its
report to the Assembly information as to the
estimated period of time which would be required
in the case of each territory to attain self-govern-
ment or independence.
Such information, of course, cannot be provided
by the Trusteeship Council unless the administer-
ing authorities make it available. The adminis-
tering authorities in general assert that to set time
limits for the attainment of self-government or
independence is an impracticable if not impossible
idea at least until a territory has very nearly
reac ed this goal. Several of the nonadminister-
ing members of the Council, however, especially
the Indian representative, argued that smce the
General Assembly had made such a request, it was
incumbent upon the Council to abide by it, and
that for this purpose the administering authorities
were bound to $11 ply the information, whether
or not they thouglit it was practicable to do so.
Speaking for the administering group, the re re-
sentative of New Zealand pointed out that t ere
was no question of the administering authorities
i oring the resolution of the General Assembly;
t ey were simply incapable of 'ving practical
effect to it. n the end, the ouncil adopted
unanimously, with one abstention, a modiﬁed reso-
lution statin that a section of the report to the
Assembly W111 include such information as the
Secretary-General can extract from existing data
which would throw light on this subject of ﬁxing
“time limits.”
Another Assembly resolution which was equally
controversial was a request that the Council give
further consideration to a proposal that qualiﬁed
indigenous inhabitants of trust territories be en-
abled to participate more fully in the work of the
Council. A number of members of the Assembly
and of the Council have held that the representa-
tives of the administering authorities cannot, in
the nature of things, fully represent the views and
feelings of the indigenous inhabitants, and that
there would be at least an educational value in
enabling certain of the indigenous inhabitants to
artici ate more actively in the work of the
ounci .
The administering authorities have strongly op-
posed this idea in its more extreme form on the
ground that it is impossible to have “dual repre-
sentation” in an international body and that, as
long as the administering authority is responsible
for the administration of a territory, it must be
recognized as the only channel through which the
territory can be represented. Certain administer-
ing authorities, including the United States, have
attempted to meet the sentiment of many of the
nonadministering members by attaching indigen-
ous persons to their delegations, both to the As-
sembly and to the Trusteeship Council. Mrs.
Dorothy Kabua, of the Trust Territory of the
Paciﬁc Islands, was thus attached to the United
States delegation at a previous meeting of the
Council and was enabled to address the Council.3
Similarly, the French delegation at this session in-
cluded as special representative in its delegation
Geor es Apedo Amah a native of Lomé, French
Togo and, who very effectively answered all ques-
tions put to him. The administering authorities
also pointed out that when visiting missions o to
the territories they are accessible to any 0 the
indigenous inhabitants who ma wish to s eak to
them or to convey written or ora messages t rough
them to the Council.
The Council, however, could not agree on this
subject, and a resolution brought forward by Syria
failed of adoption by a vote of 6 to 6. The Syrian
dele ate announced that he would re-introduce the
who e question in the General Assembly.
Results at the Seselan
that, then, can be said of the results of the
thirteenth session of the Trusteeship Council?
Has the Council shown an increasing capacity to
function smoothly and effectively as an instru-
ment of supervision? Has it gained in stature and
inﬂuence in the eyes of the public, of the terri-
torial governments, and of the indigenous inhabi-
tants?
To these questions it would be difﬁcult to give
a categorically afﬁrmative answer. It is probable
that most of the administering authorities do not
really feel the need of such supervision and, even
more, that they quite understandably resent any
express or implied efforts to make them appear
in the role of the suspicious character who needs
to be watched.
Nevertheless, they have come to accept the neces-
sity of satisf ing world opinion as to their good
intentions. hey realize that the colonial re-
lationship is not one which is' held in high es-
teem. And if the deep resentments of the past
are sometimes expressed in sharp tones by mem-
bers who have only recently gained their inde-
pendence, the administering members, as a rule,
accept these expressions in silence and dignity.
They give the impression of havin a clear con-
science. They may regard many of t e recommen-
dations with a certain disdain, but they do not
try to evade them. And it is probably too soon
to assess the beneﬁts which may accrue to the in-
digenous inhabitants whose interests are described
by the charter as “ aramount.”
Perhaps the who e matter can best be summed
up in the somewhat facetious words of President
Munro in closing the Council when he said: “The
Council 13 a curiously constituted body, but taking
it by and lar e, although I have heard statements
that the Mem ers are divided, I think it is a fairly
successful administrative union.”
