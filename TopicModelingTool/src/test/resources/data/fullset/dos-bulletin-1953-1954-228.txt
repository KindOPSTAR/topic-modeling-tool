members of the Inter-American Regional Organ-
ization of Workers. This organization known as
Oarr, includes as members the anti- ommunist
labor confederations of 17 Latin American coun-
tries. The Communists are making great efforts
to assume the leadership of Latin American labor.
Onrr is doing its best to prevent this and to help
democratic labor groups to develop.
Despite the value of all these personal relation-
ships, all these channels of information, the most
effective way to prove that private enterprise can
produce results is to let it s ow what it can do-—
to see whether economic health comes when pri-
vate enterprise is allowed to prosper. There are
several countries in Latin America where this is
hap ning, countries which have discovered that
the st guarant they can give to business is a
solid record an re utation of fair treatment.
And this presents United States and Latin Ameri-
can investors with the challenge to give over-
whelming proof that there are mutual beneﬁts—
that there are beneﬁts to the ple and Govern-
ment of the host country. en the people find
that more oods and better services and higher
we 9 are t e result—when the nation ﬁnds that
un eveloped assets are made to ﬂower—then it
does not seem like too much compensation to
permit the investor to take a reasonable proﬁt
on his investment. Countries that succeed in
avoiding drastic changes in laws and regulations,
that avoid discrimination, gradually win the con-
fidence of private enterprise. Whenever this ha -
pens, I am conﬁdent that modern business will
respond with concrete examples of economic de-
velopment that will capture the imagination of
other countries. Here again, relations with Can-
ada reveal the range of possibilities. If our in-
vestments were as great in Latin America as they
are in Canada, on a per capita basis, they would
be $60 billion rather than $6 billion.
Stimulation of Eeenemle Development
Now, you may ask, what has Government been
able to do to stimulate new economic develop_
ments? Government has provided very substan-
tial loans and technical assistance. And just last
week, the President’s message to Congress con-
cerning taxes included recommendations for tax
incentives for investors. These included 9. rec-
ommendation that the tax on certain income from
corporate investments abroad be reduced by 14
percentage points. This would greatly stimulate
economic development.
The Ex ort-Im ort Bank of our Government
has specia ized in cans for purchase of equipment
such as highway machinery, electric generators,
agricultural machinery, and mining machinery.
This bank now has outstanding in Latin America
about a billion dollars in loans. Its assistance has
been invaluable in our economic relations with
Latin America. Far from Mng the United
States tax a er an thin , exce t the temporary
use of hispfﬁnds, tilie Eiport- mport Bank has
made an overall proﬁt of over $400 million on its
loans in all parts of the world during the past 20
ears.
The International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, and the International Monetary
Fund, afﬁliated with the United Nations, are very
important elements in Latin American economic
development. With the arantee of its 55 mem-
ber nations, the bank se ls its own securities to
the public. In turn, the bank loans to member
overnments for economic development~ Nineteen
tin American countries are members, and so far
the bank has loaned $400 million to 10 of those
countries. A large part of these loans have been
for transportation equi ment and electric-power
development. Although) both this bank and the
Export-Import Bank have operated in ﬁelds where
rivate banks were reluctant to enter, both banks
ave practically perfect records of repayment of
loans.
Government has been able to stimulate wide-
spread economic development through a wide
variety of technical-assistance rograms. The
Foreign Operations Administration of our Gov-
ernment has 550 technical experts in 19 countries
of Latin America in about 50 different missions—
health, agricultural, educational, and other tech-
nical aSSistance. The health pr in in the
Amazon Valley of Brazil gives a vivid example
of results. The program began 12 years a o. In
that time, life expectancy in the region as in-
creased by 10 years on the aver , and these 10
years are the most productive aafu t years. The
programs have been so useful that they have been
increased, but the expenses are shared with the
Latin American Governments. They now pay
about twice as much as we do, and in some places
much more. In the Amazon Valley, the Brazilian
Government pays 27 times as much as we do.
While it was at ﬁrst difﬁcult to attract Brazilian
personnel for this program, it is now staﬁ'ed
entirely by Brazilians. These programs also
brought some 570 Latin Americans to the United
States for technical training last year.
As in many other aspects of our forei rela-
tions, we ﬁrst learned the value of technical as-
sistance in Latin America. It is of course diﬁicult
to trace cause and effect precisely. but technical
assistance has certainly been an important factor
in raising productivity, and it has great popular
appeal. In the postwar period, productivity in
Latin America has been increasing at the rate of
5 percent every year, insofar as national product
can be measured, while population is increasing at
the rate of 2.5 percent.
Our Government also contributes to the very
active technical-assistance programs of the Organ-
ization of American States and the United
Nations. We automatically think of these inter-
national organizations as agencies for security
