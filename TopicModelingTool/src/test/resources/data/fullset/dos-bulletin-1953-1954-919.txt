the efforts being made to meet international health
needs justiﬁed additional ex enditures on the part
of the total membership of t e organization.
The 1e islative history of the statutory ceilin
on the nited States contribution to the Worl
Health Organization indicates that the Congress
did not intend to freeze for all time the amount
this Government might ﬁnd it in the national in-
terest to provide for the support of the World
Health Organization. The record indicates that
the intent of the Congress was to regularize the
means by which it might review and reassess the
program and objectives of the organization and
the results of our participation therein. _
In 1947, the Congress placed a ceiling of $1,-
920,000 on the United States contribution to the
World Health Organization in the joint resolution
which authorized United States membership in
the World Health Organization. When the
World Health Organization undertook larger re-
sponsibilities which called for a larger contribu-
tion from the United States in 1950, the Congress
inquired into the organization’s program and de-
velopment and determined that an increase in the
ceiling was justiﬁed and in the United States in-
terest. In the light of the known circumstances at
that time, the ceiling was ﬁxed at $3 million.
The representatives of the United States at the
session of the health assembly just concluded, made
clear the fact that there is a legislative ceiling and
that it is for Congress to determine whether or
not that ceiling is to be revised.
