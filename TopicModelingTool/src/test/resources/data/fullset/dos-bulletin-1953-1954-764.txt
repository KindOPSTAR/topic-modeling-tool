Trade With the Philippines
Press release 253 dated May 14
The Department of State in a communication
to the Congress on May 13 requested an 18-month
extension of the period of free entry of Philippine
articles into the United States from July 4, 1954,
to January 1, 1956. Legislation proposed for im-
plementing this request would enable the President
of the United States to bring this extension into
effect by proclamation to cover that period be-
tween the aforementioned dates for which like
treatment is accorded U.S. articles entering the
Philippines.
The draft bill which was forwarded to the Con-
gress was prepared in response to a speciﬁc request
from the Philippine Government and as a result of
an agreement that both Governments should seek
an 18-month extension of the present free-trade
period, during which time the basic modiﬁcations
which the Philippine Government seeks in the
1946 Agreement on Trade and Related Matters
could be considered.
Sentences by International
Military Tribunal Far East
Press release 246 dated May 12
The Government of India has protested the de-
cision of the signatory owers to the Japanese
peace treaty regarding ndia’s rights to partic-
1pate in decisions with respect to persons sentenced
by the International Military Tribunal Far East.
The U.S. Government’s position on this matter is
as follows:
Article 11 of the Treaty of Peace with Japan
provides that the power to grant clemency, to
reduce sentences, and to parole with respect to
ersons sentenced by the International Military
If‘ribunal Far East (IMTFE) may not be exercised
except on the decision of the majority of the Gov-
ernments represented on the Tribunal and on the
recommendations of Japan.
T o carry out this provision the Government of
the United States consulted with the other Gov-
ernments concerned under the Treaty of Peace:
Australia, Canada, France the Netherlands, New
Zealand, and the United Kin dom. It was unani-
mously agreed among these overnments that the
power to grant clemency, to reduce sentences, and
to parole is a right conferred by the Treaty of
Peace with Japan signed at San Francisco on
September 8, 1951, and therefore comes within the
scope of operation of article 25 of that treaty.
The language of articles 11 and 25 taken to-
gether_conﬁnes the exercise of this power to the
followmg Governments, which have already
signed and ratiﬁed the Treaty of Peace with
Japan: Australia, Canada, France, the Nether-
lands, New Zealand, Pakistan, the United King-
dom, and the United States. With respect to the
articipation of Pakistan it is the Vlew of the
overnments concerned that Pakistan was en-
titled under international law to seek and be ac-
corded the rights and obligations which attached
to British India as a partici ant in the war
against Japan. Thus in regar to the Treaty of
Peace itself, Pakistan acquired the position of a
power formerly at war with Japan. Similarly
akistan is entitled to be regarded for the ur-
pose of article 11 of the treaty as having een
represented on the IMTFE and is therefore entitled
to exercise the rights conferred by article 11 of
the treaty.
It is not the osition of the Governments con-
cerned that India’s vote was transferred to Paki-
stan. Had India signed and ratiﬁed the Treaty of
Peace with J apan, both India and Pakistan would,
in the view 0 the Governments concerned, have
been eligible to participate in decisions with re-
spect to persons sentenced by the International
Military Tribunal for the Far East.
This position was conveyed b Governments
concerned to the Government of apan in March
1953_ and subsequently to the Government of In-
dia _1n response to the latter’s protest against ex-
clus10n from participation in decisions with re-
spect to persons sentenced by the IMTFE.
