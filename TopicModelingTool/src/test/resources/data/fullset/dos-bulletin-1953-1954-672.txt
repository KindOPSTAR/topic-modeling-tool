I have myself seen the freedom of the Republic
of Korea.
I have been to the Universit of Seoul and seen
the young men and women 0 Korea eagerly ac-
quiring knowledge in a free, liberal educational
institution.
I have attended sessions of the Korean Assembly
and seen the functioning of this body, whose mem-
bers had been chosen by freely contested elections
observed by a United Nations Commission.
I have met in a vast auditorium with thousands
of Christian refugees who had recently ﬂed from
North Korea into the Republic of Korea to escape
the religious persecution of the Communist North
and to gain the freedom of religion which pre-
vailed in the Republic of Korea.
The Republic of Korea, which fought so val-
iantly for freedom, will never accept unity at the
rice of thinly disguised annexation b the Soviet-
Ehinese Communist bloc. The Unite States sent
over 1 million of their youth to ﬁght in Korea to
save Korea from violent annexation by aggressors.
Of them, over 140,000 became casualtles. Cer-
tainly we are not disposed, here at the council
table, to give away what our sons battled so bravely
to reserve.
t is basic that whatever program is adopted
here for the uniﬁcation of Korea must in fact also
be a program which will assure the freedom in
Korea.
Workablo Program at "and
A workable program for unifying Korea does
not have to be invented b us. It is already at
hand. It was laid down y the United Nations
General Assembly resolution of October 7, 1950.
That is the resolution, to which I have already
referred, which established a Commission to com-
plete the uniﬁcation of Korea by observin elec-
tions in that part of Korea where observ elec-
tions have not yet been held.
That United Nations Commission (UNCURK? is
at this moment waiting in Korea ready to fu fill
its clear and precise mandate from the United
Nations.
Accomplishment of that mandate would com-
plete the uniﬁcation and freedom of Korea, which
was interrupted ﬁrst by Soviet obstruction in 1948,
then by North Korean Communist ag ession in
June 1950, and then by the Chinese ammunist
aggression of November 1950. Now that aggres-
sxon has been thwarted, the interrupted work of
the Commission should proceed. That is our
proposal.
It would require the Chinese Communist regime
to withdraw their forces of aggression and occu-
pation from North Korea so t at the United Na-
tions can complete its task in an atmosphere free
of menace.
It is important to think of freede not only in
terms of the freedom of individuals but also in
terms of national freedom. Korea is a peninsula
of such strategic value that it has for man years
been the subject of big-power politics. ussia,
Japan, and China have successively sought to use
Korea to serve their own policies of aggrandize-
ment. For a long time the Koreans have not been
the masters of their own destiny. That should be
ended.
The United States seeks no advantages in K0-
rea. lVe are in the process of concluding a mutual
security treaty with the Republic of Korea. But
that treaty implies no aggressive purpose, and the
United States does not seek thereby to gain a
forward position which could menace anyone.
J a an is no longer an aggressive force and has
loyal undertaken to refrain from the threat or
use of, force against the territorial integrity or
political independence of any other country.
The Repub ic of Korea has itself no am itions
which extend beyond its natural borders.
Are Soviet Russia and Communist China will-
ing to renounce ambitions which would be served
by control of Korea? If so, it will be possible to
we Korea that national independence which the
nited Nations has been seeking for Korea and
which the Koreans want for themselves.
Such a Korea should, of course, be a member of
the United Nations and en'oy the added dignit
and rotection which mem rship may give. I);
may e recalled that the Re ublic of Korea applied
for membership in the nited Nations in 1949.
It was prevented onl by a Soviet Union veto in
the Security Counci . That is another of the
wrongs which we should agree here to remedy.
There are those who feel that past ex rience
and cold reason combine to show the futility of the
task which we here undertake. I do not underesti-
mate the diﬁiculty of that task. But I still feel that
we need not be discouraged and that it is not a
waste of our time to seek re'sourcefully to achieve
our allotted oal.
We proper y recall the failures of the past, so
that we may proﬁt bv experience. But we also can
remember that the future is never a mere repeti-
tion of the past.
We need not let cold logic chill our hopes. We
know that those who live by faith prevail in the
end over those who live by calculation.
It is right that Korea should be united and
should be a free and independent nation able to
realize a destiny which conforms to the peaceful
aspirations of its people.
It is right that the United Nations should be
sustained as an authority to which all peoples, for
all time, may turn to save them from the scourge
of war and to assure the dignity and worth and
equal rights of nations large and small.
Our duty is to pursue these goals with dedica-
tion and with a purity of purpose which admits
of no self-aggrandizement. Then we shall have
done our part in serving principles of moral order,
which impose themselves on men and nations.
