United States should remain outside the treaty for collec-
tive security in Europe.
In view of this, and, bearing in mind the participation
of the United States during World War II in the common
fight against Nazi aggression, and the responsibility
which it bears, along with the Soviet Union, France and
Britain, for a p0st~war settlement in Europe, also con-
sidering the view expressed by the United States Govern-
ment at the Berlin meeting,‘ the Soviet Government, for
its part, sees no obstacles in the way of a favorable ad-
Justment of the problem of United States participation in
a general European treaty for collective security in
Europe.
Thus the diﬂiculty in the way of an agreement to set
up a system of collective security in Europe which has
been noted up to now should disappear.
When the Soviet proposal for a general European treaty
was examined at the Berlin meeting, the matter was also
raised of the place and role of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization in connection with the establishment of a
system of collective security in Europe.
The spokesman of the United States, as well as Britain
and France, asserted that the North Atlantic Treaty was
defensive and was not directed against any country or
group of countries.
Statements to this effect have been made by ofﬁcial rep-
resentatives of the United States, as well as spokesmen"
of Britain and France, since the Berlin meeting in com-
ment on the Soviet proposal to establish a general Euro-
pean system of collective security.
The position of the Soviet Government with regard to
the North Atlantic Treaty is well known_ The Govern-
ment of the U.S.S.R. did not share, nor can it today, the
view that this treaty was defensive.
The Soviet Government proceeds from the fact that the
North Atlantic Treaty establishes a closed group of coun-
tries and ignores the problem of averting fresh German
aggression.
And inasmuch as the Soviet Union, of all the big powers
that belonged to the anti-Hitler coalition, is the only one
that is not a signatory to this treaty, the North Atlantic
Treaty cannot but be regarded as an aggressive pact
directed against the Soviet Union.
Plainly enough, given the proper conditions the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization could lose its aggressive
character—that is, if all the big powers that belonged to
the anti-Hitler coalition became its participants.
In view of this the Soviet Government, guided by the
unchanged principles of its foreign policy of peace and
desirous of relaxing the tension in international relations,
states its readiness to join with the interested govern-
ments in examining the matter of having the Soviet
Union participate in the North Atlantic treaty.
Inasmuch as the United States Government, as well as
the British and French, say they wish to ease world ten-
sion and promote peace, we may expect that they will
look with favor on steps to insure such a situation where—
by the North Atlantic Treaty would acquire a really
defensive character and the ground would be laid to
prevent any part of Germany from becoming involved in
military groups.
In such a case the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
would cease to be a closed military group of states; it
would be open to other European countries—and this,
along with the establishment of an effective system of
collective security in Europe, would be highly important
in consolidating world peace.
The Soviet Government feels that problems arising in
this connection could be settled t0 the satisfaction of all
the interested countries in the interests of a more endur-
ing peace and great security for the peoples.

Economic Assistance to India
Statement by George V. Allen
Ambassador to India 1
I welcome this opportunity to appear before
you to su port the proposal for economic and tech-
nical as51stance to India as recommended to the
Congress by the President earlier this year.
There has been much discussion about India’s
attitude toward us and some questionin as to
whether we should continue our aid with t e cur-
rent year’s program. I hope that the information
I have obtained during my year of service in
India will assist the members of this Committee in
acting on this request.
First, let me say that the leaders of India desire
our aid and will welcome its continuance. And
from ersonal ex erience and observation I be-
lieve tiat past ai has been used eﬁectively and
that the proposed pro am for 1955, if approved
by Congress, will also e effectively used.
Indians are well aware of what we are doing to
help them. Americans today are advising in the
various Ministries in New Delhi and throughout
India. They have established personal relation-
ships of a very friendly character, and their work
is being made more immediately effective because
of the economic aid which is supportin their
technical advice. They are working with%ndian
experts and technicians in bringing to the Indian
people some realization of the people’s hope and
demand for economic im rovement. In my opin-
ion, it is in the nationa interests of the United
States to continue our aid in a manner so that its
effectiveness will not be impaired.
The people of India and their leaders believe in
a democratic form of government and are trying
to make economic progress through democratic
institutions. This is in sharp contrast to auto-
cratic, dictatorial. Commumst methods. The
present leadership of India and the Congress
Party are politica 1y committed to achieving such
progress. I admire their courage and aspirations.
It would be a tragic day for us if their present
conﬁdence in democratic methods should fail and
they thereby would abandon hope for the future
under a democratic form of government. It is
fully in our own interest to do what we can to
assist in the present eﬁ'ort now being made in
India.
I am keenly aware of the differences of opinion
and policies between India and ourselves. The
foreign policies of the Government of India and
of the United States are frequently divergent.
But we should keep in mind that democracy and
freedom of opinion go hand in hand and that
freedom must accept diversity of views. It is my

of Representatives, on May 4 (press release 26).
