I had told Mr. Molotov ﬂatly that I would not
agree to meet with the Chinese Communists unless
it was expressly agreed and put in writin that no
United States recognition would be invo ved.
Mr. Molotov resisted that provision to the last.
He sought by eve artiﬁce and device, directly
and through our a1 ies, to tempt us to meet wit
Communist China as one of the ﬁve Great Powers.
We refused, and our British and French allies
stood with us. When we went into the ﬁnal session
last Thursday afternoon, I did not know what Mr.
Molotov’s ﬁnal position would be. So far, he had
not accepted my position. \Ve were to adjourn
at seven o’clock. At six o’clock, just 60 minutes
before the ﬁnal adjournment, Mr. Molotov an-
nounced that he would accept our nonrecognition
proviso.
A Soviet concession of that order ought not to
be i nored.
It y basic position with reference to Communist
China was made clear beyond the possibility of
misunderstanding.
In my opening statement (January 26), I said,
“I should like to state here plainly and unequivo-
cally what the Soviet Foreign Minister already
knows—the United States will not agree to join
in a ﬁve-power conference with the Chinese Com-
munist aggressors for the purpose of dealin gen-
erally with the peace of the world. The nited
States refuses not because, as is suggested, it denies
that the regime exists, or that it has power. We
in the United States well know that it exists and
has power, because its aggressive armies joined
with the North Korean aggressors to kill and
wound 150,000 Americans. . . . lVe do not refuse
to deal with it where occasion requires. . . . It is,
however, one thing to recognize evil as a fact.
It is another thing to take evil to one’s breast and
call it good.” °
That explains our nonrecognition of the Com-
munist regime and also our opposition to its ad-
mission to the United Nations.
I adhered to that position without compromise.
It is that position which is reﬂected in the ﬁnal
Berlin Conference resolution. Under that resolu-
tion the Communist regime will not come to
Geneva to be honored by us, but rather to account
before the bar of world opinion.

The Berlin resolution also touches on Indochina.
It says that “the establishment, by peaceful means,
of a united and independent Korea would be an
important factor . . . in restoring peace in other
parts of Asia,” and it concludes that “the problem
of restoring peace in Indochina will also be dis-
cussed at tlie conference.”
This portion of the resolution was primarily
and properly the responsibility of France. The
'Ibid., Feb. 8, 1954, p. 181.
United States has a very vital interest in develop-
ments in this area, and we are helping the French
Union forces to defeat Communist aggression by
helping them out with grants of money and
equipment.
But the French and peoples of the Associated
States of Indochina are domg the actual ﬁghting
in a war now in its eighth year. They have our
conﬁdence and our sup ort. We can we counsel,
and that counsel is we comed and ta en into ac-
count. But just as the United States had a special
position in relation to the Korean armistice, so
rance has a special position in Indochina.
I recognize, of course, that the Soviet Union
would not have accepted 100 percent our terms for
the Korean Political Conference, unless it expected
to beneﬁt thereby. But so do we.
I can think of some Soviet beneﬁts that we would
not like and should prevent. But I do not wholly
exclude the idea that the Soviet Union might in
fact want peace in Asia.
We can ho e so, and we shall see. In the mean-
time, we sha 1 keep on our guard.
There is, however, no reason wh we should
refuse to seek peacefully the resu ts we want
merely because of fear that we will be outmaneu-
vered at the conference table. No informed ob-
servers believe that we were outmaneuvered at
Berlin.
We need not, out of fri ht, lay down the tools
of diplomacy and the possihilities which they pro-
vide. Our cause is not so poor, and our capacity
not so low, that our Nation must seek security by
sulking in its tent.
Berlin gave the free nations up-to-date, ﬁrst-
hand, ost-Stalin knowledge of Soviet intentions.
That nowledge was not reassuring. It shows
that the free nations must remain steadfast in
their unity and steadfast in their determination
to build military strength and human welfare to
the oint where aggression is deterred and the
idea s of freedom are dynamic in the world.
We must continue to hold fast to the conviction
that the peoples and nations who are today not
the masters of their own destinies shall become
their own masters.
If we do all of this, not belligerently but wisely
and soberly; if we remain ever-watchful for a
sign from the Soviet rulers that they realize that
freedom is not something to be frightened by but
something to be accepted, then we may indeed,
as these eventful coming months unfold, advance
the hopes for eace of the world, hopes so elo-
Kuently voicecF by President Eisenhower last
pril and again last December.10
