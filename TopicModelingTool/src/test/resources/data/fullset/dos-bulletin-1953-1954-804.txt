places, and circumstances. All strategic goods
don’t have the same degree of strategicness. The
free countries have embargoed some, merely
limited others in uantity, and kept still other
items under surveillance so that controls could
be imposed if necessary. Even the same item may
vary in strategic importance, depending on the
destination, the changing supply situation behind
the Iron Curtain, and other circumstances which
Ina change from time to time. Whether an item
includes advanced technology is an important
consideration. In speciﬁc cases, two experts of
equal competence may disagree on these things.
Two agencies of government, differing in func-
tion, may bring different points of view to a given
problem. The same is true of governments.
Since there is no distinctly visible boundary
between “strategic” and “nonstrategic,” some peo-
le insist there is no such thing as a nonstrategic
item at all. It is true that even bic cles, type-
writers, or ordinaryl hardware may he p the other
fellow by strengt ening his general economy.
And these people ar e that anything that con-
tributes to the genera economy helps in a military
way, too.
That is a correct concept in actual warfare but
it is not an acceptable concept of “strategic” in
the present situation, for trade on certain terms
can help the free nations too. The carry on
two-way trade with the Soviet bloc or concrete
commercial beneﬁts. The problem is to gain those
beneﬁts without permitting the Kremlin to accel-
erate the growth of military power or to divide
the free world.
In rating items as strategic or nonstrategic, it
is clear that there are innumerable commodities,
used entirely or mainly for civilian purposes,
which would not make a clearly signiﬁcant contri-
bution to war potential. No one would have
trouble drawing a line between a jet plane and a
suit of clothing, to take an extreme example. Few
would have difﬁculty putting cobalt on one side of
the line and butter on the other. As for the border
area where it is less clear what contribution an
item would make, the allied governments put their
heads together, pool their facts, and try to arrive
at mutually acceptable judgments.
As President Eisenhower has said, “Unity
among free nations is our only hope for survival
in the face of the worldwide Soviet conspiracy
backed by the weight of Soviet military power.”
U.S. POLICY ON STRATEGIC TRADE CONTROLS
The economic and trading activities of the S0-
viet empire require close and continual study by
free governments, but Soviet actions alone do not
determine free-world policies.
Let us be perfectly clear on this point. The
theme of the early chapters of this report has been
the Soviet “trade offensive” and its background,
just as the theme of the third semiannual Battle
Act report1 was the enforcement of free-world
strategic trade controls. The selection of the
theme, however, should not be taken to mean that
Soviet trading activities are the only factor that
free-world nations must take into account when
they consider what economic defense policies to
maintain in the interest of their security.
In 1953 certain other considerations were de-
manding the careful attention of the agencies of
the United States Government that are responsible
for economic defense.
The Background
One of these considerations was the probability
that the world faced a long period of tension short
of general war, though With the ever-present risk
of war. In such a period, no matter how long it
might last, it would be essential for the free na-
tions to remain strong and alert, to move together
in whatever steps were necessary for milita or
economic defense, and at the same time to eep
open the paths that might lead to a sounder bass
for peace.
Another factor of historic signiﬁcance was the
massive upswing in the strength of the free world.
Western Europe, especially, had moved into a far
stronger position, both militarily and economi-
cally, than it had occupied a few years earlier.
This ave the West greater bargaining power and
it re need the dangers of undue economic de-
pendence on Soviet-bloc trading partners.
As Western Europe grew stronger, the need for
economic assistance from the United States de-
clined. Although military aid continued in a big
way, economic aid began to taper off.
Accompanying the increase in Western eco-
nomic strength was a general shift in the free
world from a “seller’s market,” in which goods
were scarce and sellers had a relatively easy time
ﬁnding buyers, to a “buyer’s market,” in which
buyers generally could pick and choose. Some of
the free countries had produced themselves into
surpluses of some commodities—or had built up
surplus capacity and needed additional markets
in order to keep their industries prosperous.
This change brought more and more pressure
from people in free countries to carry on increased
trade with the Soviet bloc. Some groups had been
clamoring for this all along and had helped spread
the time-worn Communist propaganda that a
friendly and peace-loving “big brother” in Mos-
cow was ready and waiting with an unlimited
paradise of peaceful trade and that the only ob-
stacle to its attainment was the strategic trade
controls of the West. But now large numbers of
anti-Communist businessmen, even though many
of them were aware that the Communist propa-
