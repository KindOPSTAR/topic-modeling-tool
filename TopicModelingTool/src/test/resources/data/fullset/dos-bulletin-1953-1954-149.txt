I have stated in my letter that I am making this
request as Chairman and Executive Agent as I
can neither retain custody of Pow's, nor further
implement the terms of reference nor release the
Pow’s. I have made it clear that it is not my
intention to establish any alteration in the status
of the Pow’s or to effect their ﬁnal disposition.
I have also stated in my letter that the N NBC, in
pursuance of its functions and authority to inter-
pret the terms of reference, is of the view that
alteration of the status of Pow’s either by declara-
tion of civilian status or disposition in an other
manner requires prior implementation of t e pro-
cedures of explanation and political conference,
unless the two commands agree on some alternative
procedures or courses of action in regard to status
and disposition. I have pointed out that in
N Nno’s view any unilateral action by either party
concerned in regard to change of status or dis-
position will not be in conformity with the said
terms of reference.
In requestin you to accept restoration of cus-
tody as from anuary 20, I venture again to ex-
press the conﬁdent hope that any further steps
which might be taken by the two commands in
relation to status and disposition of Pow’s who
will soon be restored to their custody will be in-
spired by an earnest desire to further the purposes
of the armistice agreement.
