rying from one policy to another. At the risk
of criticism, let me say that no policy is better
than two policies, that if we change our policies
radically to each shifting wind we shall end by
destroying our prestige and our friendships
everywhere abroad. We must be on the lookout
for essential change, but we should never forget
the need for consistency and continuity. It is
so inﬁnitely easier in foreign affairs to destroy
than to build up. One act, one little word may
destroy in a moment the work of years. Most of
the panaceas in forei affairs offered by zealous
commentators have Ellen rejected after careful
consideration for very good reasons. The funda-
mental olicy of the count is something like
the fun amental code of an mdividual—a set of
principles to be applied as speciﬁc situations
arise. N 0 one can predict accurately what those
situations will be as our relations With other na-
tions grow and develop, but the principles gov-
erning our relations should not be lightly changed.
This counsels the most mature understanding and
wisdom in our policy makers.
The endless, continuing ﬂow of foreign affairs
and the need for consistent, continuing policies
point up the necessit for a highly trained and
well-rounded career Foreign SerVice. That we
have been steadily building up since the passage
in 1924 of the Rogers Act, sponsored by the late
husband of Edith Nourse Rogers and passed in
the administration of President Coolidge. Pri-
marily through that far-seeing measure we today
have a trained, dedicated SerVIce able to discharge
the responsibilities derived from our worldwide
responsibilities—a Service which should be a
source of intense national pride rather than of
obloquy.
Those from outside the Service who are ap-
pointed to top positions in the Department are
among those who have most emphasized this
thought. Almost without exception they will,
and do, say that their task would be impossible
without the skill, experience, and devotion to the
national interest of our career Foreign Service.
There is no conﬂict between career and non-
career in our foreign relations. In the career we
reco ize the great contributions made by distin-
guis ied noncareer ambassadors in achieving our
foreign-policy objectives. We shall not forget,
for example, how mightily Dwight Morrow im-
proved our Mexican and inter-American relations.
And if noncareer ofﬁcials have their lapses, there
is the more reason for a dedicated Foreign Serv-
ice. We appreciate the inspiration and competi-
tion which comes to us from outside; all that we
ask is that we shall be considered on our own mer-
its; that we shall not be barred from any position
for which our record may qualify us.
When foreign affairs had not yet become a
matter of crucial national interest, our diplomats
used to be criticized for wearing striped pants and
spats while they pushed cookies at pink tea parties.
I haven’t seen a pair of spats in our Service for
over 20‘ years, and, as for the rest of it, I hope
there is a special corner reserved in the nether
regions where in the hereafter our critics will be
forced to attend all the social activities of which
the so libly complain.
or should we be too critical of the ﬂowe
hraseology which our diplomats so often use. lIa".
is simply that they know that Dale Carnegie was
right. When you are irritated, it may ease your
feelings to give vent to a few choice lines of plain
speaking, but it isn’t likely to make the other man
any more friend] . Di )loniats are supposed to
get results in dea ing With other nations and not
merely to tell the latter what they think of them.
Some people think bluster is a substitute for ac-
tion. The fact is that diplomatic bluster gen-
erally ends by leaving the nation using it with a
very red face. It is as unwise in diplomacy as in
any other walk of life to say something you don’t
mean—to have an empty bluff called. If in the
jungle world of toda we must for our own sur-
vival carry a big stic , let us not for et the other
hafl floi' Theodore Roosevelt’s admonition, to speak
so t .
Oiilr Foreign Service has no reason to be
ashamed of its record. In the 1930’s, when our
ress was discounting the military menace of Hit-
er and public opinion was isolationist, our diplo-
mats were reporting that Hitler meant war—and
were denounced on that aecount as warmongers, so
enthralled by high-bosomed duchesses that we
would needlessly drag the United States into
wicked Europe’s quarrels. Durin World War II
our diplomats were accused of re -baiting when-
ever we suggested that the Soviet leaders might be
something less than a choir of angels. After the
war some of our Japanese experts were driven
from oﬂice by public criticism, because they did
not favor drastic measures against Japan. Today
we are accused of taking strong doses of Com-
munist dialectic with our morning coffee. I
wearin wonder what preposterous charge the
morrow will bring. If, like Cassandra, a diplo-
mat can forsee an evil, it is not treason to predict
it; it is what we are trained for. It will be a
sorry day for the country if our diplomats are
ever afraid to report disagreeable truths, or are
too stu id to perceive them. Let that remain ex-
clusive y a taunt we can apply to Soviet diplo-
macy.
Relatlons Wlth Latln Amerlca
In our Latin American relationships, we hear
criticisms that we spurn democracy and fawn on
dictators. On the other side of the street we are
ur ed to protect our investments by being friendly
on y witi those governments which uphold the
status quo.
With regard to the ﬁrst, we repeatedly tried in
earlier years with the best of intentions to im-
