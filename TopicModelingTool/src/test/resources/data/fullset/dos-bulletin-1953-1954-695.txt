The problem of the underdeveloped country is
not to rotect itself from the American investor
but rat er to solicit his active interest—t0 demon-
strate that there are opportunities for proﬁtable
investment and that reasonable efforts are being
made to meet his legitimate requirements as to
treatment. In short, there is a selling job to be
done by the capital im orting countries in awaken-
ing interest, in dispe ling ignorance, and in in-
spiring conﬁdence. These countries should recog-
nize that when they seek private capital they enter
a highly competitive market, where they must
compete with other areas and the op ortunities
they offer for proﬁtable investment. he estab-
lishment of conditions conducive to private invest-
ment is extremely important, but it must be sup-
plemented by active measures to attract capital—
and success should not be expected overnight.
This is not primarily a job for the governments of
capital exporting countries; it can only be done by
those countries seeking and needing foreign invest-
ment.
Private capital must be attracted. It cannot be
driven. A successfully operating enterprise is
better evidence of the actual investment climate
than broad statements of policy or intent. This
emphasizes the importance of treating existing
enter rises in a fair and nondiscriminatory man-
ner, or the maltreatment of a single ente rise
can do much to deter the ﬂow of capital—an the
eﬁects often travel beyond the borders of the par-
ticular country involved.
We commend the steps taken in certain coun-
tries which indicate their realization of the im-
rtance of the problem and the nature of the
Job to be done. We in the more highly developed
countries are fully prepared to advise and assist
where appropriate, although nothing on our part
can substitute for the basic decisions and policies
of the capital importing countries.
U.S. Encouragement of Investment Abroad
In recent years the United States Government
has taken various steps to encourage investment
abroad by United States citizens:
The Government has sought to give wide circu-
lation to information on foreign investment oppor-
tunities. We publish investment opportunities in
the F oreign Commerce Weekly and also dissemi-
nate such information through the ﬁeld ofﬁces of
the Department of Commerce and through cham-
bers of commerce and trade associations. Through
the contact clearinghouse system of the Foreign
Operations Administration we circulate invest-
ment opportunities to several thousand American
private individuals and ﬁrms. Our Department
of Commerce published an analysis of factors
affecting investment in some 26 countries. It is
now publishing studies on investment conditions
and outlook in selected countries. Such studies
have been ublished to date on India, Venezuela,
and Colom ia.
The United States is actively ursuing a pro-
gram of negotiating treaties which have as one of
their objects the assurance of conditions favorable
to the investment of private foreign capital. At
the resent time there are in effect 32 compre-
henswe treaties dealing with general economic
relations between the United States and individual
foreign countries. We are prepared to sit down
at any time with the representatives of a country
desiring to facilitate foreign investment for the
purpose of discussing the conclusion of such a
treaty.
Since 1948 the US. Government has had in
operation a program under which it is prepared
to offer guaranties against certain of the non-
business risks affecting investment abroad.
Limited at ﬁrst to European countries, the pro-
has since been expanded and is now available
or new US. investment in an country which
concludes the necessarv bilatera agreement with
the United States. Guaranties may be issued
against the risk of inability to convert local cur-
rency earnings into dollars and the risk of loss
from expro riation or nationalization. Outside
of Europe t e only countries which have availed
themselves of this program are Israel. China, the
Philippines, Haiti, and Japan. Discussions of
the guaranty program have taken place with a
number of other countries, and again the United
States is prepared to discuss the application of
the program to any country which sincerely de-
sires to encourage the entry and operation of
American enterprise. The President has recently
recommended that this program be further ex-
anded to cover risks of war, revolution, and
insurrection.
To provide incentives for an increased ﬂow of
private ca ital abroad, President Eisenhower has
recommenged to the Congress a number of im-
portant changes in the United States tax laws
relating to the taxation of income from foreign
sources. Congressional hearings on these pro-
posals are beginning this very day. Included in
these recommendations is a proposal to tax busi-
ness income derived by United States corporations
from sources abroad at a rate equal to 14 percent-
age points less than the rate prevailing at the time
with respect to corporate income in the United
States.
For illustration, instead of the present tax rate
of 52 percent on corporate income, the rate ap-
plied to earnings from foreign operations would
be only 38 percent. At the same time, the long
established policy of granting a tax credit for
certain taxes paid abroad would reduce the effec-
tive rate in most cases to something much less
than 38 percent.
These tax beneﬁts would, generally speaking,
be made available to United States corporations
operating abroad either through a branch or
