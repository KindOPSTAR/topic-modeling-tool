So you do meet at a time when grave issues are
being studied and examined by people who are—
like you—ordinary Americans longlng for peace,
striving to see that peace shall be our lot, and
shall be our prize. They do it exactly as you do it,
by meeting together, by discussing the problems,
by trying to ﬁnd a solution which adheres to com-
mon sense and to logic, that avoids the extremes
on both points, by tr ing to go down that broad
middle way where t e great and vast majority
of Americans—indeed of the world—can go in
perfect accord and unity.
I would say only one additional thing. From

Toward a Free Korea
Statement by Secretary Dulles ‘
We are here to establish a united and inde-
pendent Korea. It may be given us to write a
new age in what has been a tragic history. The
peop e of Korea for centuries lived together as
one nation and together they have long endured
foreign subjugation and a gression. They have
sought to be united in free 0m and independence.
ThIS is a right which no nation or group of na-
tions can legitimately deny them.
The United States has come here with the Re-
public of Korea and with the other governments
whose armed forces came to Korea’s assistance in
a renewed and determined effort to aid the Korean
people _to realize their reasonable and rightful
aspirations.
Why does Korea remain divided? The 1943
Declaration of Cairo promised that victory over
Ja an would be used to make Korea “free and
in ependent.” But that has not happened.
The present phase of Korea’s martyrdom goes
back to August 1945. Then the Unlted States,
which had for 4 years borne the burden of the
Japanese war, a eed that the Soviet Union might
move into Manc uria and Korea north of the 38th
parallel to accept there the surrender of the J apa-
nese. But the Soviets, having gotten into North
Korea for one purpose, stayed on for another pur-
pose. Their goal has been, directly or through
puppets, to turn North Korea into a satellite state

minute. And that is this: A long face never
solved any difﬁcult problem. As you ap roach
these problems you must do so in the conﬁdence
that America is great and is powerful and that it
can do anything when we are united among our-
selves. You must do so in the certainty that you
are striving for the positive factors of happiness
and enjoyment in this life and not in the mere
negative idea that we are avoiding destruction
or disaster this one day. There must be an ap-
proach that reﬂects conﬁdence, courage, and the
certainty that you—and your children—are goin
to have this reat America, and live in it, and
be as proud 0% it and its past as we are this day.
and, if possible, to extend their rule throughout
all Korea. In so doing, they have consistently
deﬁed agreements with their former allies and
also the collective will represented by the United
Nations.
It is im ortant that we should constantly bear
in mind t lat what is here at stake is not merely
Korea, important as that is; it is the authority of
the United Nations. The United Nations as-
sumed primary responsibility for establishin
Korea as a free and independent nation. t
helped to create the Republic of Korea and nur-
tured it. When aggressors threatened the Re-
pIublic of Korea with extinction, it was the United
ations which called on its members to go to
Korea’s defense.
Korea provides the ﬁrst example in history of a
collective security organization in actual o era-
tion. If this Conference is disloyal to the nited
Nations and its decisions, then each of us will
bear a share of responsibility for destroying what
protects us all.
Yesterda the delegates of the Republic of Ko-
rea and of olombia told eloquently of the mission
which the United Nations had assumed in rela-
tion to Korea. It is a story that bears repetition.
The United Nations ﬁrst took jurisdiction of the
Korean roblem in 1947. It then created a Tem-
porary ommission for Korea to help organize a
Government of Korea and to observe the initial
elections. The Soviet Union refused to permit
the United Nations Commission to have access to
