remainder was held to ﬁnance expansion programs
or for other corporate purposes.
Retained earnings in 1952 amounted to $875 mil-
lion, and dividends and branch roﬁts remitted to
the United States to about $1.4 bi lion. These earn-
ings were after payment of foreign income taxes
which in 1950 amounted to 30 percent of before-tax
earnings. The tax rate has been higher in subse-
quent years, thou h a more recent percentage ﬁg-
ure is not availabii. Thus, these forei direct in-
vestment companies have paid wel over $800
million per year in the past 3 years to foreign ov-
ernments in the form of direct income taxes. T eir
actual contribution to foreign government tax re-
ceipts is, of course, larger not only because of in-
direct taxes but by reason of the eral lift which
their operations give to the national income and
hence the tax base of countries in which they
operate.

The Oﬁice of Business Economics analysis
throws interesting light on the extent to which
these direct investment com anies operating
abroad supply the needs of the .8. market. They
provided one-ﬁfth of total US. imports in 1952
according to a detailed study of 19 commodities 0
major importance in the US. economy. Some of
the commodities—such as petroleum, copper,
nickel, and aluminum (including bauxite)—are
obtained almost entirely from foreign enterprises
in which Americans are the principal investors.
For others like crude rubber and iron ore, a smaller
share comes from U.S.-controlled companies. In
the case of iron ore, however, the supply from U.S.-
developed sources abroad through new investments
currently being made will be greatly expanded,
and this will also be true of such commodities as
manganese and titanium.
Sales by these direct-investment enterprises in
the US. market yield more dollars than are cur-
rently required for the remittance of earnings to
the United States and account for about one-third
of their total earnings Furthermore, the enter-
prises established abroad since the war have be-
come major sources of su ply for various products
which formerl had to be purchased for dollars
in the United tates.
Income received on US. rtfolio investments
abroad, i.e., holdings of foreign securities, claims,
or miscellaneous assets not connected with foreign
affiliated companies, was nearly $200 million in
1952. Income from this source was small relative
to the income from direct investments, which indi-
cates the major shift in the character of our invest-
ments abroad over the ast quarter century. In
the 1920’s, when portfo io lending predominated
portfolio earnings represented over 40 percent of
ttgtéal earnings, as against less than 10 percent
ay.
Interest pa ments by foreign countries on cred-
its extended y the U.S. Government were about
$200 million in 1952, and further payments on
schedule would bring an increase in 1954. About
80 percent of the interest is aid by countries in
Western Europe, mainly the nited Kingdom and
France.
Partial data available for 1953 indicate little
overall change in earnings on direct investments,
although there are some differences among indus-
tries. Prices of man mineral and agricultural
commodities produce abroad by the U.S.-con-
trolled enterprises were lower in 1953, but there
was no ma'or change in petroleum production or
prices. The etroleum companies account for
about two-ﬁftiis of direct investment earnings.
Industrial activity in many forei countries in-
creased late in 1952 and continue to rise in 1953,
so that manufacturing earnings are expected to be
higher this year than in 1952.
