that securit during the war and postwar years
in many di erent ways.
We tried to get it by the Atlantic Charter, to
which all of our governments subscribed. I am
afraid none of us can feel that the provisions of the
Atlantic Charter have been lived up to, provisions
which assure the right of all peoples to choose the
form of government under which they will live and
to see sovereign ri hts and self-government re-
stored to those who have been deprived of them.
\Ve tried to get it by the declaration of Yalta,
which provided, amon other things, a declaration
on liberated Europe w ich provided for the estab-
lishment of free governments by the free elections
throughout Europe.
An then we tried to get it by the U.N. Charter,
which re uires all of us, and most of the nations of
the worl , not to use force against the political
independence or territorial integrity of other
states.
Why have we not gotten European security and
world securit out of these documents we have
Signed? Not ing is wrong in the wording.
\Vhat has been wrong is, at least in the opinion
of some, that other parties to the agreements have
not lived up to these agreements and there has
followed a eat sense of insecurit in the world
because of ack of trust and conﬁ ence in men’s
and nations’ will to live up to their pled ed word.
_ That is why there has grown up in t e world,
in addition to the pro osed universal system of
the_United Nations, ot er regional collective se-
curity arrangements exercising what the charter
calls “the collective right of self-defense.”
Regional Arrangements Based on Conﬁdence
These s ecial security arrangements do not have
any wor s that add anythin not already in the
United Nations Charter. he addition which
they provide is that they are agreements between
nations which, over long periods of time, have
come to trust and have conﬁdence in each other.
They provide the element of conﬁdence which un-
lfortunately has not been present on a universal
mm.
The Soviet Foreign Minister has asked why, if
the 21 American nations had made a Rio pact, is
it not equally logical that the mysterious “32”
nations of Europe should not make a pact if the
Rio pact, the pact of the Americas, is not just a
regional pact. It is a pact which, as the treaty
itself provides, contains this declaration:
Peace is founded on Justice and moral order and,
consequently, on the international recognition and pro-
tection of human rights and freedoms. . . .
Those are not mere words, in the case of the pact
of the Americas; that is an expression of reality
which has been demonstrated by close association
for 150 years. And the ingredient which makes
the Rio pact a dependable reality is the fact of
conﬁdence which is based upon 150 years of peace—
ful association.
And so it is that groups of countries have sought
to augment the words of the United Nations Char-
ter with the essential element of conﬁdence based
upon long historic association.
That is true of the British Commonwealth of
Nations. It is true of the nations which are bound
to ether by the North Atlantic Treaty.
he North Atlantic Treat is based upon the
expressed determination of t eir peoples to safe-
guard the freedom, common heritage, and civili-
zation of their peoples, founded on the rinciples
of democracy, individual liberty, and t ie rule of
law.
And those words, again, are not just ink on
aper. Those words are the expression of a real-
ity which has been demonstrated over many gen-
erations and which are bound not by ink, but by
blood which has been shed in protecting that
common heritage.
Actions Leadlng to NATO': Founding
It is suggested that this North Atlantic Treaty
is a cause of division. It is clearly evident that
history has revealed that the coming into close
association of the Western nations is not a cause
of disunit , but is caused by the fear and a pre-
hension w ich, to an increasm degree, seize hold
of these countries as the resu t of actions which
occurred elsewhere.
I recall that this postwar coming together had
its ﬁrst major beginning in the Brussels pact of
March 17, 1948. I recall, however, that that was
preceded by the Communists’ armed efforts to
overthrow the lawful government of Greece and
b the forceable coup d’etat whereby the Czech
overnment was overthrown and a Communist
Government installed in its place.
Then I recall that there was the blockade of
Berlin, which brought war very close to Euro e.
And it was during that period that the i ea
of strengthening the Brussels pact by bringing
in the United States, Canada, and other countries
ﬁrst was conceived, and that treaty, the North
Atlantic Treaty, was then realized in 1949.
Even then, however, it was not thought to be
necessary to implement that treaty with any large
military or nization.
I recall t at I was in the United States Senate
at the time of the ratiﬁcation of that treaty, and
we did not think it would be necessary actually
to implement any large military organization
under the Atlantic treaty.
But then came the armed ag ression in Korea,
in June 1950, followed by the C iinese Communist
aggression of November 1950. And these events
created fear to such a degree that it seemed nec-
essary to build a sufﬁcient strength in Europe to
create a respectable balance of power.
