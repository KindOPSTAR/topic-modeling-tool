tives of the Service and in close cooperation have
worked out the various problems which naturally
would arise in the implementation of a new stat-
ute. I am glad to say that we have been able to
work out each and every problem which has come
to our attention during these ﬁrst 15 months.
Although I am not speaking here for the Im-
migration and Naturalization Service, I am cer-
tain I can say both for that Service and for the
De artment of State that we have done everything
and) will continue to do everything possible to
interpret and administer the immigration laws
consistent with the intent of Congress and in the
best interest of the United States.
Recommendatlons Concerning U.S. Foreign Economic Policy
Message of the President to the Congress 1
I submit herewith for the consideration of the
Congress recommendations concerning the foreign
economic olicy of the United States.
Due to t e urgency and signiﬁcance of our prob-
lems in this area, I previously recommended, and
the Congress approved, the establishment of the
Commission on Foreign Economic Policy. Its
membership, consisting of seventeen elected ofﬁ-
cials and private citizens, was drawn from all parts
of the country and represented diverse points of
view. The Commission’s report,2 prepared in the
American tradition of full debate and vigorous
dissent, has been carefully reviewed by the various
Executive Departments of the Government and
forms the basis for the program I submit in this
message.
Before the Commission began its deliberations
I said to its members, “I commend to you an atti-
tude both realistic and bold. Above all, I ur e you
to follow one guiding principle: What is st in
the national interest.” a
The national interest in the ﬁeld of foreign
economic olicy is clear. It is to obtain, in a man-
ner that is consistent with our national security
and proﬁtable and equitable for all, the highest
possible level of trade and the most efﬁcient use of
capital and resources. That this would also
strengthen our military allies adds urgency.
Their strength is of critical importance to the se-
curity of our country.
Great mutual advantages to buyer and seller,
to producer and consumer, to investor and to the
community where investment is made, accrue from
high levels of trade and investment. They accrue
no less in trade from nation to nation than in
trade from community to community within a
single country. The internal strength of the

American economy has evolved from such a system
of mutual advantage.
In the press of other problems and in the haste
to meet emergencies, this Nation—and many other
nations of the free world—have all too often lost
sight of this central fact. Worldwide depression
and wars, inﬂation and resultant economic dislo—
cations, have left a sorry heritage: a atchwork of
temporary expedients and a host 0 restrictions,
rigidities, interferences, and barriers which seri-
ously inhibit the ex ansion of international trade.
Thus are impeded t e very forces which make for
increased production, emplovment, and incomes.
The tas s of repairing the physical dama e
caused by the catastro he of war have been su -
stantially achieved. e creation of an ad uate
system of defense for the free world is wel ad-
vanced. Most of the countries which suffered the
ravages of war have made remarkable headway
toward ﬁnancial stability and increased produc-
tion. Their own efforts have been reatly aided
by our assistance, and yet, despite t is recovery,
we and other free nations are still severely limited
by the persistence of uneconomic, manmade bar-
riers to mutual trade and the ﬂow of funds among
us.
Together we and our friends abroad must work
at the task of lowering the unjustiﬁable barriers—-
not all at once but gradually and with full regard
for our own interests. In this effort, the United
States must take the initiative and, in doing so,
make clear to the rest of the world that we expect
them to follow our lead.
Many foreign restrictions have been imposed
as a consequence of the so-called “dollar gap.”
This phrase has become the symbol of the failure
of the free world to ﬁnd a lasting solution to the
imbalance of international payments. We should
no longer ﬁll it by major grants to enable other
nations to secure what they need but cannot buy.
Our aim must not be to ﬁll the dollar gap, but
