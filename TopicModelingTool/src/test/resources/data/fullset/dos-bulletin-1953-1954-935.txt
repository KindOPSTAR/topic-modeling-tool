Peace and Security in the H-Bomb Age
by David W. Wainhouse
Deputy Assistant Secretary for United Nations Affairs 1
The Northwest Institute of International Rela-
tions has chosen for the title of the present meet-
ing “United States F orei Policy in the H-bomb
Age.” This is indeed a c allengin subject. We
now are living in a period in whic the develop-
ment of thermonuclear weapons holds a prime
place in newspaper headlines and in the minds of
people everywhere. This leads me to inquire to
what extent has this development aﬁ'ected our
basic forei policy objectives and the means for
achieving t em.
Secretary Dulles has summed up our objectives
clearly in one sentence: “The central goal of our
policy is peace with freedom and security.”
In our efforts to ﬁnd that often elusive objective
of peace with freedom and security, a wide variety
of means is employed. I would say that the United
States uses four general approaches. First, we
try to bring about the adjustment of international
differences through the processes of peaceful set-
tlement. Secondly, we attempt to strike at the
root causes of international unrest by supporting
international efforts to alleviate social and eco-
nomic ills and by our own rograms for improving
the world’s living and hea th standards. Thirdly,
we are developing an effective system of collective
security against aggression, wherever it may oc-
cur. Fourthly, we are seeking agreement on a
general program for the re llation, limitation.
and balanced reduction of a l armed forces and
all armaments, including nuclear weapons, which
would contain effective safeguards to ensure
compliance.

Our basic obligation to promote peaceful settle-
ment of international disa reements rests in the
United Nations Charter. is obligates all mem-

ful means in such a manner that international
peace, security, and justice are not endangered.
It is not a new obligation for the United States.
In fact its historical roots reach back to the early
days of the Republic. Nor is it the only interna-
tional treaty in which we have undertaken to
advance the processes of peaceful settlement.
Most of the treaties and declarations which form
part of the inter-American regional system con-
tain paciﬁc settlement provisions. As a speciﬁc
illustration, the Pact of Bogota, which established
the Charter of the Organization of American
States, obligates the American States to submit
all international dis utes that may arise between
them to the peacef procedures set forth in that
charter before referrin these disputes to the
Security Council of the nited Nations.
Our desire to utilize means of peaceful settle-
ment is not limited to the inter-American system.
The North Atlantic Treaty of April 4, 1949, obli-
gates tlle parties to settle any international dis-
putes in which they may be involved in such a
manner _that international peace and security,
and justice, are not endangered, and to refrain in
their international relations from the threat or
use of force in any manner inconsistent with the
purposes of the United Nations.
T 1_e United States has demonstrated its support
of this principle of peaceful settlement in one case
after another which has arisen within the United
Nations framework. Our efforts contributed to
the peaceful settlement of such issues as the with-
drawal of British and French troops from S ria
and Lebanon and Soviet troops from Iran, fol ow-

lems in 1946. lVe layed a major role in he ping

tween the Dutch and the Indonesians which led to
Indonesian independence. Our support of the
Balkan Commission’s efforts in Greece certainly
contributed to the easing of a dangerous situation
between Greece and its nei hbors. We have layed
a principal role in the éeneral Assemblys and
Security Council’s efforts to bring to an end the
