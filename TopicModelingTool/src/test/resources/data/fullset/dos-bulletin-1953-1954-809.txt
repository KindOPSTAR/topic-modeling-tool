Let us be thankful that they are that way, and that
there still survives so much rugged determination to be
free.
On December 2, PreS1dent Eisenhower endorsed
the declaratlon of the Secretary of State and said
th1s : °
The easiest thing to do with great power is to abuse
it, to use it to excess. This most powerful of the free
nations must not permit itself to grow weary of the
processes of negotiation and adjustment that are fun-
damental to freedom. If it should turn impatiently
to coercion of other free nations, our brand of coercion,
so far as our friends are concerned, would be a mark
of the imperialist rather than of the leader.
What America is doing abroad in the way of military
and economic assistance is as much a part of our own
security program as our military efforts at home. We
hope to be able to maintain these overseas elements of
our security program as long as our enlightened self-
interest requires, even though we may, and probably
we always will, have various diﬂerences of opinion with
the nations receiving our aid.
On that same day, Admiral Arthur Radford,
Chairman of the J omt Chiefs of Staff, spealn'ng
1n eneral of America’s leadership role in the
wor (1, said in a speech at West Point:
Relationships between members of coalitions are
never simple, particularly in coalitions as large as ours
of the free world. The smaller nations eXpect, and are
entitled, to exercise their sovereignty and independence.
Our leadership therefore involves self-restraint if our
objectives are to be achieved by consent, rather than
through the pressure techniques imposed by the Soviet
on her satellites.
There is one commodity that is not on any list
but is more important than all others, and that is
the cement that binds the free world together.
Work of Seventeenth Session
of Economic and Social Council
Statement by H enry Cabot Lodge, Jr.
U.S. Representative to the United Nations
U.S./U.N. press release 1914 dated May 4
The obtaining of full rights for Ireland and
Italy as well as for Portugal, Austria, and F in-
land in the United Nations Economic Commis-
sion for Europe was an outstanding accomplish-
ment of the recently concluded session of the Eco-
nomic and Social Council. It was also most grati-
fying to have full rights in the Economic Com-
mission for Asia and the Far East obtained for
the Republic of Korea, Japan, Viet-Nam, Cam-
bodia, Laos, Ceylon, and Nepal.
We only wish these actions could be followed
by the Soviet Union abandoning its veto to the
admission of these countries and others to the
other bodies of the United Nations. These na-
'Ibid.
tions would bring much strength to the United
Nations—which it badly needs.
It is atifyin that the Soviet-sponsored candi-
dates, umaniaﬁdulgaria, Hungary, and Albania,
were kept out of the Economic Commission for
Europe and that the Communist Chinese, North
Korean, and Viet Minh regimes were also kept out
of the Economic Commission for Asia and the
Far East.
These successes were due, in large measure, to
the excellent work of Mr. Preston Hotchkis, the
new United States Representative in the Economic
and Social Council, who showed unusual skill and
vigor in presenting the United States viewpoint
and obtaining widespread support for it.
The United States also succeeded in eliminating
from consultative status the Women’s Interna-
tional Democratic Federation, a Communist-domi-
nated organization which consistently had per-
verted the Council’s work—especially by using it
as a propaganda platform for false attacks on the
United States for alleged atrocities and germ war-
fare in Korea.
IVe obtained a strong condemnation of forced
labor, which is so widely used in the Soviet world
for political and economic purposes, and we ar-
ranged for the United Nations to keep this dread-
ful practice under continued scrutiny. We re-
vealed for the ﬁrst time the com rehensive pattern
of forced labor in Communist hina.
\Ve made sound and substantial progress in cre-
ating a more favorable atmosphere for the invest-
ment of American private capital in underdevel-
oped countries by securing the assage of a reso-
lution outlining realistic rules or capital export-
ing and importing countries.
\Ve struck a blow for freedom of the press every-
where by obtaining approval for further United
Nations studies on restrictions on freedom of in-
formation, and especially on censorship.
Mr. Hotchkis and his staff did a remarkable job
in cutting through Soviet bloc opposition to chart
a course of sound and constructive development
which promotes the interest of the United States
and of our partners in the free world.
