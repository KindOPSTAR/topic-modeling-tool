ceased in 1946. It was continued to Bulgaria and
Rumania until 1948, to Czechoslovakia and Poland
until 1949, and to refu ees in Hungary until 1952.
Concurrently with t e termination of the activ-
ities of the President’s \Var Relief Control Board,
the President in a letter of May 14, 1946, said in
part: “. . . during the present critical period it
appears desirable that provision be made for co-
ordinating relationships with voluntary relief
agencies. . . . It is my suggestion that you . . .
'ointly appoint a new Committee on Volunta
oreign Aid, to be made up of outstanding citi-
zens, to tie together the overnmental and private
programs in the ﬁeld ofgforeign relief. . . .”
In response to the President s uest Charles P.
Taft was appointed Chairman, an Chester Davis
and William L. Batt members of the Advisory
Committee on Voluntary Foreign Aid to serve
without com ensation. Subsequently the Com-
mittee was en arged with the appointment of Wil-
liam I. Myers vice Chester Dav1s Clarence Pick-
ett, Lessing Rosenwald, Joseph Chamberlain
(deceased), and Francis P. Matthews (deceased).
At that time, the Committee issued a circular
letter of July 11, 1946, to agencies interested in
voluntary forei aid, stating that although Fed-
eral licensing o agencies was no lon r required
as a war measure other forms of Fefeei'al re la-
tion would continue. These, for exam le, re ated
to certain export licenses required by t e Depart-
ment of Commerce, to allocations by the Depart-
ment of Agriculture of food and fats in short sup-
ply, and to restrictions of the Department of
ustice respecting political or propaganda activ-
ities by foreign agents. The Committee stated
that pursuant to the President’s directive its ur-
pose was “to guide the ublic, and agencies see 'ng
support of the public, in the appropriate and pro-
ductive use of voluntary contributions for foreign
aid.” It pointed out that understanding and good
will had been fostered during the active war ears
among the war-stricken people by the use 0 vol-
untary relief resources to complement the ublic
funds of the United States and other pub ic au-
thority; that close coo eration between the volun-
tary agencies and the mmittee could further the
productive expenditures of the resources contrib-
uted by the American people.
The Adviso Committee, in the light of these
factors, invite the cooperation of all agencies
which appealed to the public for funds and con-
tributions in kind for voluntary aid, including
projects of relief, rehabilitation, reconstruction,
and welfare. Acceptance of this invitation was
subject to the obligation to record with the Com-
mittee, for public inspection, a quarterly ﬁnancial
statement, a monthly report of foreign money
transfers and commodity exports, a periodic
budget and public audit, and current reports of
operations at home and abroad. Sixty-one oper-
ating agencies, representative of church, civic,
ethnic, labor, and farm groups, which had been
licensed by the President’s Board, accepted these
obli ations. The undertook to record volun-
tari y with the A visory Committee the informa—
tion that they had been required to provide under
license durin wartime.
Subsequent y, on November 22, 1949, the Advi-
sor Committee on Voluntary Foreign Aid, which
ha been maintaining interdepartmental liaison
with the Department of State and the De artment
of Agriculture, was established in the O ce of the
Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs of the
Department of State under the direction of an
adviser, the adviser to serve also as ex oﬂicio
Executive Director 0 the Advisory Committee:
A voluntary regis r was set up by authority
of the Assistant Secii lar of State for Economic
Affairs “to foster the ub ic interest in the ﬁeld of
voluntary foreign ai and the activities of non-
overnmental organizations which serve the public
interest therein; to serve as a re ository of infor-
mation for public idance; an to facihtate the
programs and prOJects of the registrants through
the good offices and facilities authorized by t e
laws, and re lations. . . .”°
The Presi ent, when he enjoined the Advisory
Committee upon its establishment “to tie together
the governmental and private programs in the
ﬁeld of foreign relief,” set up a benchmark that
has been the point of reference in the relations of
the Government and the voluntary agencies
throughout the postwar years. This tying to-
gether has marked the most productive relie and
rehabilitation o erations of the registered volun-
tary agencies; or voluntary foreign aid is most
productive when it complements publicaid and
that of the local agencies in the participating
countries.
Public Law 84 of the 80th Congress recognized
this complementary relationship. This law au-
thorized, and Public Law 271 appropriated, $332
million for the rovision of food, medical sup-
plies, clothing, eed, fertilizers, pesticides, and
seed for general assistance to war-devastated a
includin Austria, Greece, Italy, Trieste, an
China. ection 2 f), “in order to effect the eco-
nomical and expan ed use of American voluntary
relief contributions,” authorized up to $5 million
to pay the cost of ocean transport of voluntary
sup lies determined to be “essential supplements
to e supplies provided by the general relief as-
sistance program.” The supplies considered as
essential supplements included food, clothi and
expendable medical and hospital supplies. nder
authority of Executive Order 9864 of Ma 31,
1947,1 the regulations of the Department of tate
allowed reimbursement of the transportation
costs to the voluntary agencies registered with the
Advisory Committee on Voluntary Foreign Aid.
Added authority in Public Law 271 permitted the
inclusion of agencies operating in areas under
' 17 Fed. Reg. 6082.
' 12 Fed. Reg. 3559.
