it cannot be created. It remains our responsibility
no matter what anyone says about us—enemy,
friend, or neutralist. And we may be sure that
the more we succeed in acquitting ourselves of this
responsibility, the more vituperations we shall
have from our enemies—who will see their oppor-
tunities fadin —the more frankly our friends will
speak their minds, and the she er the criticism
will be from some of the neutra ists. That will
all be evidence that we are achieving our ends.
Our Debt to the Past and the Future
* \Ve are fond of saying in speeches that we
must help in the defense of freedom everywhere
because it is in our self-interest to do so, because,
so long as freedom is in danger anywhere, our
mm is not safe. That is quite true. I ﬁnd it
tiresome, however, and unworthy of us to invoke
exclusively our own self-interest. Our respon-
sibilities are not rimarily to ourselves but to
the ast and to tie future. Our freedom was
bought not at Yorktown and Midway alone but
on a thousand battleﬁelds from Thermo lae to
the Marne, Lake Ladoga, and the skies of ritain.
Our material possessions go back to Archimedes,
the Arab algebraists and Galileo. \Ve Americans,
unlike the Russians, did not invent everything.
Much of the inspiration of our art and our reli-
gion is to be found among the ancient peoples
of the East.
As we look about us at our heritage and at the
magniﬁcent continent we inhabit, we must be con-
tinually reminded how much we owe not only to
our own efforts but to other peoples and to Prov-
idence. This is a debt we can repay only to the
fellow-inhabitants of our world and to the future.
For my own part, I feel that nowhere more than
in Asia, where so many are struggling against
such heavy odds for one-hundredth part of the
rewards we take for ranted, will assistance from
us be productive 0 important returns for all
mankind.
We are today passing through a crisis in the
condition of the human race. It is a crisis at once
physical and moral, like the crises in some ill-
nesses, which involve the patient’s stamina both
of body and spirit. We have been contributing
what we have been able to the strength of the
patient. lVe shall go on contributin . But others
must do so too. The battle will ta e everything
that all of us can put into it. \Ve recognize in the
United States that it cannot be won unless we
carry our end. But if the failure of the United
States to acquit itself of its responsibilities must
lead to a fatal issue of the crisis, so too must a
failure on the part of others to acquit themselves
of theirs.
Perhaps the underlying problem of our whole
generation is how the peoples of our ever more
crowded planet are to live together. The Com-
munists have one answer, and it is an effective
one. The peoples under Communist rule are
equalized under an iron dictatorshi that sets all
cultural differences at naught by eliminating all
cultures, reducing the diversity of the human race
to the gray uniformity of the least common de-
nominator. The other alternative, if we are not
to exterminate one another, is a society which
tolerates individual differences and welcomes cul-
tural diversity on the grounds that our essential
common humanit counts for most of all, making
us all equal on t e highest plane as creations of
a Supreme Being. It is on this principle that
the reat confraternity of our country, mingling
all t 1e races of the world in one English-speaking
union, has held together and prospered. It is
similarly through recognition of essential com-
mon interest among diverse communities that the
Commonwealth has been created, a eat asso-
ciation of nations spannin the glo , demon-
strating that peoples of unlike race and religion
may acknowledge an abiding relationship with-
out detriment to their independence and integrity.
If the peo les of this world are neither to de-
stroy themse ves in conﬂict over their differences
nor to be brought within a single prison camp in
which no diﬁerences will be tolerated, each nation
will have to take stead counsel of its conscience
and contribute to its full capacit to a. better solu-
tion. Our common experience s ows such a solu-
tion to be possible. For our part, if to the extent
of our ability we Americans help the races of man-
kind in the world at large achieve the same basis
of mutual forbearance and respect and of peaceful
interchange that those same races have found on
our continent, we shall then, and only then, have
fulﬁlled our responsibility.
