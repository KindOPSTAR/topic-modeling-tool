U .8. Representative on the Goa/nail of the Organization of Awwriom States 1
To an increasin extent since the close of World
War II, the U.S. as, in addition to participating
in and supporting the United Nations, depended
upon the creation of regional security arrange-
ments for the strengthening of its own national
security. Of these regional arrangements, which
include the North Atlantic Treaty and the Secu-
rity Treat between Australia, New Zealand, and
the Unite States, the oldest is that among the
American States.
Having its roots in the history of inter-Ameri-
can relations as far back as a century and a quar-
ter a o, the collective security system of the Amer-
ican e ublics was already in virtually ﬁnal form
when t e United Nations was established. In
fact, the determination of the members of the
inter-American system to protect the ability of
their regional organization to maintain peace and
security was lar ely res onsible for the inclusion
in the United ations gharter of articles which
recognize the right of collective self-defense and
of provisions regarding regional arrangements for
peace and security.
The Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal As-
sistance, commonly known as the Treaty of Rio de
J aneiro, which was signed in 1947, ﬁxed the form
of the inter-American collective security arrange-
ment. This treaty, moreover, served as an impor-
tant precedent for the North Atlantic Treaty
which followed soon thereafter, as well as for
other regional security arran ements either con-
cluded or proposed by the U5.
Thus is illustrated an important and interesting
feature of inter-American relations—the fact that
on more than one occasion the U.S. has developed

in its relations with the other American Republics
basic policies and ideas which subsequently have
been extended to the larger arena of world affairs.
There is one respect, however, in which the inter-
American collective security system differs im-
portantly from the others which have been
modeled upon it. All of these regional security
arrangements are defense agreements having as
their purpose the common defense of the member
states against attacks by other states not included
in those arrangements. The inter-American sys-
tem, however, now formalized in the Organizatlon
of American States, has a second important pur-
pose, namely, the maintenance of peace and secu-
rity among the members of the system as well. The
Treaty of Rio de J aneiro is an important instru-
ment of continental defense. But it is also sig-
niﬁcant for its applicability to an attack or threat
which any American State might make upon
another.
Let us ﬁrst take a brief look at how the
inter-American system of collective security was
developed.
The Monroe Doctrine
From the viewpoint of the U.S., the springboard
from which the move for the development of a
continental defense system derived its impetus was
the Monroe Doctrine. This basic foundation of
American foreign policy has come through a num-
ber of mutations and 1nterpretations during the
125 years since it was ﬁrst enunciated. It may be
well, therefore, to recall its true original character.
In 1823 the U.S., a young and relatively weak
republic, felt itself threatened by the reactionary
forces of the Holy Alliance. Most of the Latin
American States had at that time won their inde-
