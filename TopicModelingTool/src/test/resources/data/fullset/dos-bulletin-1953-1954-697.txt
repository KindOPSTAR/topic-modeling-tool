his capital overseas is a grasping monopolist, a
robber baron, snatching exorbitant proﬁts, lootin
the natural resources and enslaving the labor 0
other countries. That was the essence of the
general charge.
Now, what were the speciﬁc charges. It is in
duty and my privilege to answer them, not with
emotion or countercharge with false statements,
but with plain simple truths of facts.
First, we were told that the United States is
forcing the underdeveloped countries to concen-
trate almost exclusively upon the production of
primary roducts for our industries. Second, we
were tol that the United States deliberately
stands in the wa of genuine economic develop-
ment by preventing the growth of industry in
these countries.
U.S. Encouragement of Forolgn Industry
This we were told was the case in Latin America.
If the Soviet representative would take the trou-
ble to examine the Economic Survey of Latin
America for 1951-52 prepared by the United N a-
tions, he would ﬁnd that an outstanding feature of
the economic history of Latin America since the
war has been the remarkable expansion in manu-
facturing. For example, in 1952, the output of
factories in Latin America was valued at almost
$11V2 billion, while the total output of agriculture
in Latin America in the same year was valued at
$8.3 billion.
Does that conﬁrm the charge of the Soviet rep-
resentative that the United States is preventing or
discouraging manufacturing in the underdevel-
oped countries?
Again, he argued that if we were genuinely in-
terested in helpm the underdevelo d countries,
that we should he p them build stee mills. Well,
let’s look at the record. That record is the pub-
lished reports of the U.S. Export-Import Bank.
It shows that we made loans to help build steel
mills in Mexico, in Brazil, and in Chile. Loans
were also made for the construction of textile
lants in Brazil and Chile and Turkey, and also
or chemical plants in Mexico; for the mechaniza-
tion of rice production in Ecuador; for the con-
struction of cement plants in Saudi Arabia; and
for the modernization of trans ort and communi-
cation in countries such as Chile, Brazil, Mexico,
Ethio ia, and Liberia, to give but a few examples.
In razil a new metallurgical industry has been
established through the introduction by an expert
of the United States Bureau of Mines of an im-
proved process for reﬁning antimon from lead,
makin this industry proﬁtable for t s ﬁrst time.
In uba, as a result of the work of a technical
assistance mission from the United States, a whole
new industry has been started—using kenaf ﬁber
as the raw material for its products.
Does that support the charge of the Soviet rep-
resentative that the United States is preventing
or discouraging manufacturing in underdeveloped
countries?
Now, let us examine for a moment the char
that private U.S. investment is interested only in
extracting raw materials from the underdeveloped
countries. _
In Brazil, U.S. private investment has gone into
meatpacking, assembly of automobiles, production
of automobile tires, chemicals, pharmaceuticals,
electrical sup lies, and radios. U.S. investors,
jointly with razilian interests, are engaged in
the manufacture of rayon, rubber goods and elec-
tric light bulbs. In Chile, U.S. private invest—
ments are found in the manufacture of glass
products, automobile tires, synthetic textiles and
other products, most of which are consumed by
the local population. In Argentina, I happen to
know that the U.S. private investment is very
active in the manufacture of rayon and other syn-
thetic ﬁbers. _
In 1951, for example direct investment by
United States citizens in Latin America amounted
to $441 million; half of this was invested in manu-
facturing industries.
In India, American Cyanamid Company, to-
ether with local Indian investors, recently estab-
ﬁshed a factory for the production of pharmaceu-
tical products as well as dyestuffs and sulfur.
Although the American company holds onl 10
percent of the capital stock, it has made avai able
all its techniques and patents. It has also been
training Indian engineers to take over the opera-
tion of the plant.
In man instances, American ﬁrms manufactur-
ing comp ex machinery or equipment for sale in
underdeveloped areas have been movmg the actual
manufacturing of parts into those countries. For
instance, International Harvester Company has
recently completed in Brazil a. plant where the
most modern techniques of the manufacture of
parts for farm equipment, for tractors and trucks
are employed. t has built a similar plant in
Mexico. _
I could recite examples such as these indeﬁnitely.
They are not in any wa unique and are but indi-
cations of the many 'ﬁerent ways the United
States and the private investor of the United
States are assisting in the diversiﬁcation of the
economies through the world.
The Soviet representative char that U.S.
private investment has not gone into activities
which beneﬁt the underdeveloped countries. In
making the statement he completely overlooked
the fact that the entry of foreign capital is rig-
orously screened by the governments of most re-
cipient countries. It is only when the capital
importing country decides that a proposed invest-
ment would be of substantial beneﬁt that the in-
vestment is permitted.
Referring to the charge made by the Soviet rep-
resentative that exorbitant proﬁts are exacted by
U.S. investments in foreign countries, he quoted
