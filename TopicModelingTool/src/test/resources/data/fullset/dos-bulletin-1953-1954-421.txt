In this ti htening of bonds between Turkey and
Pakistan, t is Government sees nothing but the
creation of stren h of a purely defensive nature.
It unites those w o in our opinion see the danger
of free peoples from the same sources that we see
that danger. It unites people who share a. deter-
mination to do all they can, on their own, to resist
such threats to their freedom and security.
We hope that other nations will see attraction
in this move sponsored by the two powers ﬂanking
the Middle East. I do not believe this to be a for-
lorn ho e. Other nations in the Middle East, I
am c0 dent, will recognize the purely defenswe
nature of the arran ment. Such developments
must come by the Will of the nations themselves
although our interest in such a trend would be
great.
This is a world full of anxiety and fear. Some,
at times, become pessimistic as to the future.
Commercial Treaty With Israel
DEPARTMENT ANNOUNCEMENT
Press release 107 dated March 4
The instruments of ratiﬁcation of the treaty
of friendship, commerce, and navigation between
the United States and Israel were exchanged on
March 4 in Washington. The exchange was made
by Acting Secreta of State Smith and Abba
Eban, the Ambassa or of Israel, at a brief cere-
mony. This action completes the formal proce-
dures connected with bringing the treaty into
force. By its terms the treaty will enter into
force on April 3, the 30th day following the ex-
change of ratiﬁcations.
The treaty was signed at Washington on Au-
st 23 1951. It was approved by the United
tates Senate on July 21 of last year, subject to
a reservation regarding the practice of profes-
sions, and by the Government of Israel on J an-
uary 6, 1952. It was ratiﬁed by President Eisen-
hower on December 18, 1953, and Israel completed
its ratiﬁcation procedures on January 21, 1954.
Entry into force of the new treaty marks the
establishment of formal treaty relations of a gen-
eral character between the two countries. The
treaty is the ﬁrst of its kind to be concluded b
Israel and the sixth of this general type which
the United States has brought into force with in-
dividual foreign countries since the end of World
War II. It is designed to regulate basic economic
relations between the contractmg parties in accord-
Those who feel that way fail, in m opinion, to
take into account constructive bonds t at are stead-
ily growing among the free eoples on this earth.
To me, the picture of frien 1y dependence upon
neighbors and allies by the members of regional
groupings such as I have outlined tonight in Eu-
rope the Balkans, and the Middle East, is tremen-
dous y encouraging.
When I say this I am thinking perha even
more of the political point of view than am in
terms of straight militar preparedness. The
bonds that are being forme by a sense of common
dan er are daily iving evidence that nations are
willing to subordinate many of their traditional
national rivalries and frictlons for the common
good. I sincerely believe that this is necessary not
only to win a struggle that might be thrust upon
the free world, but more importantly—to prevent
such a catastrophe from happening at all.
ance with advanced and enlightened standards
of treatment and to furnish a stable and enduring
basis for their future economic intercourse. It
contains provisions on basic (personal freedoms,
propert rights, investment an business activities
general y, taxation, exchange regulations, the
treatment of im orts and exports, shi ping, and
other matters agecting the status an activities
of the citizens and enterprises of either country
when within the territories of the other.
SUMMARY OF SIMILAR TREATIES
Upon entry into force the treaty with Israel
will be the sixth ostwar addition to the network
of bilateral treaties which the United States long
has sought to develop in furtherance of orderly
and mutually beneﬁcial economic relationships
with other countries. It is one of 10 such treaties
si ed since the close of World War II as part
0 an intensive effort to expand and modernize
this treaty network. The other postwar treaties
which have come into effect are with Ireland,
Italy, Ethiopia, Japan, and China. The treaties
signed with Denmark, Greece, Colombia, and Uru-
guay have not as yet been ratiﬁed.1
