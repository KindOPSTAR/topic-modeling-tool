have reached a position where we can guarantee
future resistance at the outset against any ag-
gression, and we have served notice that an ag-
gressor invites devastating retaliation at a time
and at a place of our own choosing.
As long as American basic policy concepts were
unclear and undecided, it was not possible for our
Joint Chiefs of Staff to act deﬁnitively in building
our military power. Accordingly, our enemies
were able to choose the time and place and method
of attack, while we met aggression by local op-
ition. The initiative la with them, and we
ad to react wherever they c ose to prod us. Now
the President and the National Security Council
have taken the necessary basic policy decisions,
based largely on our great capacity to retaliate
instantly y means and at places of our own choos-
ing. Our defense establishment can shape our
military apparatus to ﬁt our policy, and this
means that a selection of military methods is pos-
sible, instead of a multiplication of means.
The relationship the United States desires
with other free nations is one of mutual respect
which will endure. \Ve believe that for durability
our voluntary partnership should be based on a
coequal status of the partnership. If one nation
continues to be a permanent provider for the
others, or if it is expected to carry a dispro rtion-
ate share of the community burden, mutua respect
will be destroyed and resentment will grow. We
have found that one does not buy friendshi 8,
nor do our allies expect our friendship to En
bought. Therefore, except as a corollary to mili-
tary support, the aid programs will be reduced.
In their stead we look for greater economic oo-
o ration and increased trade. The Randall
ommission ap inted by the President, has re-
cently complete a painstaking study of our for-
eign trade. The recommendations of this Com-
mission have been submitted to the President and
will, in all probability, form the basis for his
proposals to the Congress on trade matters.’ As
the greatest market and the largest producer, the
United States has a particular responsibility in
this ﬁeld. If we can manage a sound and eco-
nomic expansion of our world trade, we will make
a. substantial contribution not only to our own
strength and well-being but to the economic
healt of our coworkers among the other free
nations.
I would point out that the changes arising from
this reexamination of policy are more those of
emphasis than of basic positions. The deterrent
aspect of our security program has always been
there, but it was not given the priority it now
has. \Ve are still backing the principle of col-
lective security, and we propose to strengthen it.

The Problem of a blvldod Germany
Our Secretary of State, and his colleagues of
Britain and France, are now meeting With the
Soviet Union in Berlin in an attempt to bring to
an end the Soviet division of Germany. The con-
tinued division of that nation is unwarranted and
unjust, and we believe that it is time a united, free
and democratic Germany was restored to its place
in the community of W'estern Europe.
We are convinced that any practical plan of
defense for Western Europe must include ro-
visions for the defense of \Vcstern German . nd
we cannot visualize a defense of Western ermany
that does not call for the participation of \Vest
Germans.
We give our utmost support to a European
Defense Community, a pro‘ect, I might add, which
has encountered stead and bitter op osition from
the Kremlin. It is o vions, from t is bitter op-
osition, that the Soviet Union has ambitions in
estern Europe with which such a defense com-
munity will interfere.
Thus far, the Soviet re resentatives at Berlin
have brought forward not ing new. In response
to our demand for free elections throughout Ger-
many, Mr. Molotov has roposed a plebiscite.
The Soviet representative a so ur 7 d that the Fed-
eral Government at Bonn, which is a freel elected
government, and the puppet regime in ast Ger-
many be considered as equal for the purposes of
treaty negotiation.
No thinking person could take Mr. Molotov’s
plebiscite proposal seriously. I am inclined to
oubt that he expected anyone to do so. It was
basicall a propaganda maneuver, and it has
failed, due to the skilled diplomacy of Secretary
Dulles and his \Vestern colleagues. Interestingly,
the Soviet behavior at the conference has been
more relaxed and less ag ssive than any re-
corded during the peri of Stalin’s control.
While this superﬁcial change is welcome, we have
yet to encounter any evidence of a basic modiﬁca-
tion in Soviet policy. When Molotov says no, his
voice is softer. But the answer is still no.
Until there is a change in the substance, as well
as the tone of the Soviet response, the real peace
we seek remains a hope, and a cal to strive for.
Yet I cannot believe that any ictatorship, how-
ever ruthless, can forever suppress the human
spirit. God will prevail against those who deny
him. The captive system can neither match nor
stand against the spiritual and the material
strength of a free society.
Sooner or later the men of the Kremlin will
recognize this, or recognition will be forced upon
them by those they have enslaved. Then, we will
rea the reward for the sacriﬁces we have made
in t e cause of peace.
And at that point, we will realize that peace was
well worth the effort.
