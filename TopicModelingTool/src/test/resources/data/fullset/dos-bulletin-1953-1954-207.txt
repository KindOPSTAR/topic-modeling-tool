pressing desire of the people for economic and
social improvement would be seriously jeopar-
dized by continuin tension.
In the words of r. Byroade,
We recognize the need for keeping the Suez area avail-
able for the use of those powers able to assist in the
defense of the non-Communist world, which includes
Egypt herself. At the same time. we view with the most
friendly spirit the aspirations of the Egyptians for com-
plete and indisputable sovereignty. In all differences of
this nature. our fundamental problem is to lessen sus-
picion and encourage agreement between the Eastern and
Western powers. By every word and action of our Gov-
ernment, we should make it clear that the old colonial
relationship is dead and that it will stay dead. At the
same time, we should encourage a better understanding
of the possibilities inherent in a new relationship based
on voluntary cooperation among independent nations.
Arab-Israeli Tensions. I have Previously men-
tioned our detailed position in regard to the refu-
gees and economic aid to the Arab States and
Israel. Our overall policy in regard to the Arab-
Israeli controversy remains as it was stated by
Secretary Dulles on June 1, 1953, when he re-
turned from his history-making trip to the Middle
East. At that time he said:
Israel should become part of the Near East community
and cease to look upon itself, or be looked upon by others,
as alien to this community. This is possible. To achieve
it will require concessions on the part of both sides. But
the gains to both will far outweigh the concessions re-
quired to win those gains.
The parties concerned have the primary responsibility
of bringing peace to the area. But the United States will
not hesitate by every appropriate means to use its in-
fluence to promote a stepby-step reduction of tension in
the area and the conclusion of ultimate peace.
Iran. Whereas there is still a long road ahead
before a settlement is likely to be reached to the
Arab-Israeli problem, there is a eneral feeling of
o timism in \Vashington about t e Anglo-Iranian
difficulties and about the future of Iran itself.
Recent developments there have led most observers
to believe that the new overnment, under the
leadership of the forwar -looking Shah and his
aggressive Prime Minister Zahedi, is dedicated to
the task of building Iran into a strong and stable
country, one that will be able to resist Communist
aggression and assist in maintaining world peace.
In their accomplishments to date, in the progress
they have made in establishing order and security
in Iran, in their constructive efforts toward build-
ing a sound economy, and in their resumption of
diplomatic relations with the British, Iran’s pres-
ent leaders have shown both courage and decisive-
ness. As a result of the events of the past few
months, the prospects have brightened for an oil
settlement, unquestionably Iran’s No. 1 problem.
There is every indication that the Zahedi gov-
ernment and the Shah recognize that a solution
must be in keeping with the national aspirations
of the Iranian people and at the same time be
commercially sound enough to rmit the resum -
tion of Iran’s oil ﬂow to worl markets. On t e
other side, the British thinkin on Iran now gives
evidence of greater understan ing of the Iranian
point of view. The United States, which has not
taken sides in the controversy, has made repeated
attempts to assist the parties concerned to ﬁnd
a solution fair to both sides. These efforts are
still continuing. Man of you may know Herbert
Hoover, J r., Special onsultant to the Secretary
of State on international oil matters, who is cur-
rently using his vast experience and technical
knowledge in advising the Secretary on this dif-
ﬁcult problem.
Area Defense. Last, but certainly not least, the
United States is iving most earnest consideration
to the problem 0 helping the people of the Near
and Middle East defend themselves from the
threat of outside aggression. There has been a
great deal written recently in the American press
about possible American aid to Pakistan and a
decision on this matter should shortly be reached.
In spite of all this recent publicity and s ecula-
tion, the policy of our Government on the efense
of the Middle East is clear and consistent. It
was best stated by Secretary Dulles on June 1,
1953:
A Middle East Defense Organization is a future rather
than an immediate possibility. Many of the Arab League
countries are so engrossed with their quarrels with Israel
or with Great Britain or France that they pay little heed
to the menace of Soviet communism. However, there is
more concern where the Soviet Union is near. In gen-
eral, the northern tier of nations shows awareness of the
danger.
There is a vague desire to have a collective security
system. But no such system can be imposed from with-
out. It should be designed and grow from within out of
a sense of common destiny and common danger.
While awaiting the formal creation of a security asso-
ciation, the United States can usefully help strengthen the
interrelated defense of those countries which want
strength, not as against each other or the West, but to
resist the common threat to all free peoples.
Our future military relations with Pakistan or
with other states of the area will be within this
framework.
So much for a consideration of American for-
eign policy in the Middle East as it is today, as
shown by ofﬁcial words and acts during the past
year. I think you will agree with me that the
words are those of a Government which is itself a
friend of all the peoples of the Middle East. And,
actions speak even louder than words. The ac-
tions I have reviewed show a United States Gov-
ernment increasingly interested in the problems of
the peoples and governments of the area, a Gov-
ernment aware of the mutuality of interests which
link us with that important part of the world, a
Government which is each year devoting more
time and attention to the vital Middle East.
