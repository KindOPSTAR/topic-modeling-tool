Integration With Western Europe
The policy of Chancellor Adenauer is a policy
of integration of \Vest Germany with W estern
Europe. He regards such integration as a nec-
essary step toward the reuniﬁcation of Germany
in eace and freedom. Contrary to what some
of liis political o ponents maintain he believes
there is no antithesis between uniﬁcation and
European inte ration. Rather, he and his asso-
ciates believe t lat the Russians made it plain at
Berlin that until the \Vest proves itself to be
strong and united, the Russians will not forego
their ambitions to move the Iron Curtain further
westward and will not consider relinquishing
their hold on the Russian Zone of Germany. Fol-
lowing his line of thought, one could look forward
to the day when a reunited Germany can become
one of the stalwart nations in a new ty e of free
Europe, a free Europe which can face oldly the
totalitarian challenge from the East.
This vision of the future which a pears to be
in the minds of the leaders of the Fe eral Repub-
lic today may be regarded by some of you as an
illusion. I know the fear of a revitalized Ger-
many exists.
Many people in the United States are appre-
hensive about what the new Germany will do.
They have seen or heard or read of the teeming
energy of \Vest Germany in 1954. They only as
themselves, “\Vill this powerful new nation prove
a stabilizing inﬂuence or will it as it has twice
in the memory of most of us draw us into a
holocaust?” I have said I was not going to be
a prophet but I do venture to summarlze my re-
vious diagnosis: Germany today is unlike ger-
many either in the 1920’s, the 1930’s, or before
World \Var I. There are a number of powerful
political personalities in different parties work-
1ng toward a close cooperation with the ‘West and
strong believers in a peaceful and democratic
Germany. These men need the help and under-
standing of the freedom loving people of this
country and the European nations. The error of
the victors in the 1920’s must not be repeated.
The recent declaration of assurance of Great
Britain and the United States, contingent, of
course, on the realization of the European Defense
Community,a renders it clear that the new Ger-
many will be a ﬁrmly integrated member of the
free world. I know no better answer to those who
raise questions about the future of Germany after
its sovereignty is restored.

tody of a carillon which the Netherlands people
are giving to the people of the United States, was
announced by the Department on May 3 (press
release 224). Dr. Kortenhorst’s osition in the
Netherlands is analogous to the o ~ce of S eaker
of the House of Representatives in the nited
States.
On April 4, 1952, Her Majesty, Queen Juliana
of the hetherlands, presented a token gift sym-
bolizing the permanent carillon to be iven at a
future date.1 The remaining 49 bells ave now
arrived and, pending the erection of a permanent
tower for them, have been placed in a temporary
framework in West Potomac Park. This gift is
being offered in atitude for the American con-
tribution to the 11 ration of the Netherlands and
for subsequent aid from the United States in the
recplgstruction and rehabilitation of the Nether-
lan .
Joseph W. Martin, Jr., Speaker of the House
of Representatives, will take custody of the bells
on behalf of the people of the United States during
the ceremonies at West Potomac Park on May 5.
Symbol of Rumanian People's-
Fortltude and Perseverance
Statement by Secretary Dulles
Press release 23-7 dated May 8
President Eisenhower, in his address delivered
at a luncheon of the American Society of News-
paper Editors on April 16, 1953, stated that one
of the political settlements the United States looks
forward to is the full independence of the East
European nations.
It is ﬁtting that on May 10 the people of Ru-
mania both at home and abroad should be re-
minded of this statement by the President. May
10, the traditional national holiday of the Ru-
manian people, is celebrated in commemoration
of three great events in Rumanian history. In
1866, May 10 witnessed the proclamation of
Charles as Prince of Rumania; 11 ears later on
the same date the Principalit of umania pro-
claimed its independence; an on Ma 10, 1881,-
Charles was crowned, by the will of is people,
King of Rumania.
Knowing full well the people’s attachment to
the anniversary of these glorious events in the
history of their country, the present Rumanian
regime attempted to shift the celebrations to other
days in honor of more recent events. This effort,
however, was fruitless. Even though the people
of Rumania are today prevented by ruthless force
