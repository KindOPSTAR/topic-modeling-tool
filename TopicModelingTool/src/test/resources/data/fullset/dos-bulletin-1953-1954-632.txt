How effective such literature has been to date is
difﬁcult to determine precisely. There is eve
reason to believe, however, that its ublication is
worthwhile, a conclusion which is bolstered by the
ever greater efforts which have been made in the
ﬁeld of organized travel.
Organized, s armored travelers are numerous,
and their num r is increasing. They include
those who take part in group tours arran ed by
travel agencies and those who participate in ighly
organized trips sponsored by private groups or
by the Government, with systematic activities and
speciﬁc objectives in mind. In the ﬁrst group,
t ose organized by travel agencies for “self-se-
lected” persons, increasing attention is being given
to the preparation of the travelers, at least as re-
gards suc information as conditions of travel
abroad and local customs and re ulations. Such
preparation at the very least ma es travel itself
easier and may, therefore, develop a better oriented
and more receptive visitor. Some plans go fur-
ther. One, for example, is that of the American
Express Company, for members of the Book-0f-
the-Month Club. Those who plan to take part in
one of a series of vacation tours receive from the
Club—free of charge—a kit of careful] selected
books about the countries and regions to be visited.
These kits include not only guide books but also
surveys of the history, customs, and ways of life
of the countries to be visited.
Such activities, however, are not conﬁned to
reading matter. Some universities, through ex-
tension courses, oﬁ'er courses to prepare people for
travel abroad, and travel companies and others
are offering “package tours.”
A recent newspaper article notes, as a new trend,
planned travel to Europe and Latin America
ased on bringin American tourists into contact
with (peo le of Similar interests in the countries
visite — e they lawyers, farmers, coal miners, or
automobile salesmen.
Sponsored travelers are usually those who wish
to travel for s eciﬁc and relatively serious pur-
poses. The we l-known programs of the Institute
of International Education and the philanthro ic
foundations need only be mentioned here. he
“Junior Year Abroad” programs of several col-
leges are in the same class. Of special interest in
this ﬁeld are the interchange projects arranged
by the 4—II Club Foundation—the International
Farm Youth Exchange, which every year sends
abroad groups of young Americans from rural
areas to spend several months on farms in the host
countries and brings young people to the United
States for similar purposes.~ Top-ﬂight musical
and theatrical artists and groups also are becom-
ing increasingly aware of the role they can and
do play in projecting the cultural achievements
of America to foreign audiences—for example,
Porgy and Bess tours, those of the Ballet Theatre,
those sponsored by the American National Theatre
and Academy (ANTA). Among them, they make
an impressive story and an inspiring one.
Aside from these, most sponsored travel proj-
ects are of relatively short duration and for the
summer months. They have various purposes and
exhibit varying degrees of or anization. In
many, the participants are self-se ected; in others
they are chosen and ﬁnanced in whole or in part
by sponsors. Some offer deﬁnite rofessional ad-
vantages to professional eople— or example, the
trips arranged by the National Education Associa-
tion for teachers. Here the articipants are
large] self-selected but trips ollow a deﬁnite
plan f'or the cultivation of professional contacts
and earn academic credit for their participants.
Planned travel of another type is that sponsored
by the General Federation of “’omens Clubs.
The Federation has conducted several world-co-
operation tours, two inter-American cooperation
trips, and a ﬁeld seminar in Mexico, all in the last
2 years. Some of the participants were self-se-
lected; others were chosen for the speciﬁc pur-
oses of the tour. As a result of these tri s, the
ederation has published a pamphlet, {no to
Make Friends and Capture Memories, containing,
among other things, a list of “do’s and don’ts”
of travel.
By far the most numerous in this group are
those on work-study tours. The National Student
Association, for example, has sponsored such trips
and has issued information booklets each year on
work, study, and travel projects. Other types of
projects have included hostel and work-camp_ac-
tivities. and the Communit Ambassador Pr01ect
of the Bureau of Adult E ucation of New York
State. All these work-study rojects are or-
ganized for speciﬁc purposes. It 0st, if not all, of
them include as an objective, implicitly or ex-
plicitly, the development of international coopera-
tion and understanding through personal contact
and constructive, worthwhile activity. The ac-
ceptance, screening, or selection of travelers is
made with this, among other thin , in mind. A
considerable amount of careful a vance prepara-
tion, includingliterature and oral brieﬁngs, is
undertaken. In most cases, travel and activities
overseas are also guided and supervised. Many
sponsors carefully evaluate their activities with
an eye to constant improvement.
Many projects sponsored by nonproﬁt organiza-
tions are coordinated by the Council on Student
Travel. The Council got its start from the action
of the State Department's old Division of Ex-
change of Persons which in 1947, in response to
widespread demands to break the “bottleneck” in
low-cost summer travel for students, cooperated
with the Maritime Commission in making avail-
able troop transports operatcd at commercial rates
by the U.S. Lines. While this effort of the Gov-
ernment lasted only until 1950, it sparked the
formation of the Council which, with the assist-
