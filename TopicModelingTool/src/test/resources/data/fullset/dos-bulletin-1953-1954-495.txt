OFFICIAL TEXTS OF AGREEMENTS
Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement Between
the United States of America and Japan
The Government of the United States of America and
the Government of Japan,
Desiring to foster international peace and security,
within the framework of the Charter of the United Na-
tions, through voluntary arrangements which will further
the ability of nations dedicated to the purposes and prin-
ciples of the Charter to develop eﬁective measures for
individual and collective self-defense in support of those
purposes and principles;
Reafﬁrming their belief as stated in the Treaty of Peace
with Japan signed at the city of San Francisco on Sep-
tember S, 1951 that Japan as a sovereign nation possesses
the inherent right of individual or collective self~defense
referred to in Article 51 of the Charter of the United
Nations;
Recalling the preamble of the Security Treaty between
the United States of America and Japan, signed at the
city of San Francisco on September 8, 1951, to the eiIect
that the United States of America, in the interest of peace
and security, would maintain certain of its armed forces
in and about Japan as a provisional arrangement in the
expectation that Japan will itself increasingly assume
responsibility for its own defense against direct and indi-
rect aggression, always avoiding any armament which
could be an offensive threat or serve other than to pro
mote peace and security in accordance with the purposes
and principles of the Charter of the United Nations;
Recognizing that, in the planning of a defense assistance
program for Japan, economic stability will be an essential
element for consideration in the development of its de-
fense capacities, and that Japan can contribute only to
the extent permitted by its general economic condition
and capacities;
Taking into consideration the support that the Gov-
ernment of the United States of America has brought to
these principles by enacting the Mutual Defense Assistance
Act of 1949, as amended, and the Mutual Security Act
of 1951, as amended, which provide for the furnishing of
defense assistance by the United States of America in
furtherance of the objectives referred to above; and
Desiring to set forth the conditions which will govern
the furnishing of such assistance;
Have agreed as follows:
Aarrcm I
1. Each Government, consistently with the principle
that economic stability is essential to international peace
and security, will make available to the other and to
such other governments as the two Governments signatory
to the present Agreement may in each case agree upon,
such equipment, materials, services, or other assistance
as the Government furnishing such assistance may au-
thorize, in accordance with such detailed arrangements
as may be made between them. The furnishing and use
of any such assistance as may be authorized by either
Government shall be consistent with the Charter of the
United Nations. Such assistance as may be made avail-
able by the Government of the United States of America
pursuant to the present Agreement will be furnished
under those provisions, and subject to all of those terms,
conditions and termination provisions of the Mutual De-
fense Assistance Act of 1949, the Mutual Security Act of
1951, acts amendatory and supplementary thereto, and
appropriation acts thereunder which may affect the fur-
nishing of such assistance.
2. Each Government will make effective use of assist-
ance received pursuant to the present Agreement for the
purposes of promoting peace and security in a manner
that is satisfactory to both Governments, and neither
Government, without the prior consent of the other, will
devote such assistance to any other purpose.
3. Each Government will offer for return to the other,
in accordance with terms, conditions and procedures
mutually agreed upon, equipment or materials furnished
under the present Agreement, except equipment and ma-
terials furnished on terms requiring reimbursement, and
no longer required for the purposes for which it was
originally made available.
4. In the interest of common security, each Govern-
ment undertakes not to transfer to any person not an
ofﬁcer or agent of such Government, or to any other gov-
ernment, title to or possession of any equipment, mate-
rials, or services received pursuant to the present Agree-
ment, without the prior consent of the Government which
furnished such assistance.
ARTICLE II
In conformity with the principle of mutual aid, the
Government of Japan agrees to facilitate the production
and transfer to the Government of the United States of
America for such period of time, in such quantities and
upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon
of raw and semi-processed materials required by the
United States of America as a result of deﬁciencies or
potential deﬁciencies in its own resources, and which
may be available in Japan. Arrangements for such trans-
fers shall give due regard to requirements for domestic
use and commercial export as determined by the Govern-
ment of Japan.
An'rrcm': III
1. Each Government will take such security measures
as may be agreed upon between the two Governments
in order to prevent the disclosure or compromise of
classiﬁed articles, services or information furnished by
the other Government pursuant to the present Agree
ment.
2. Each Government will take appropriate measures
consistent with security to keep'the public informed of
operations under the present Agreement.
Aaricm IV
The two Governments will, upon the request of either
of them, make appropriate arrangements providing for the
methods and terms of the exchange of industrial property
rights and technical information for defense which will
expedite such exchange and at the same time protect
private interests and maintain security safeguards.
ARTICLE V
The two Governments will consult for the purpose of
establishing procedures whereby the Government of Japan
will so deposit, segregate, or assure title to all funds allo-
cated to or derived from any programs of assistance
undertaken by the Government of the United States of
America so that such funds shall not be subject to gar-
nishment, attachment, seizure or other legal process by
any person, ﬁrm, agency, corporation, organization or
government, when the Government of Japan is advised by
the Government of the United States of America that
any such legal process would interfere with the attain-
ment of the objectives of the program of assistance.
