New Foreign Relations
Volume Released
Press release 174 dated April 2
The Department of State is releasing on April 10
Foreign Relations of the United States, 1936, Vol-
ume I, General, The British Commonwealth. Of
outstanding historical interest in this volume are
the documents on two steps alon the road to
World War II: the breakdown in e orts for mili-
tary and naval disarmament and Hitler’s dramatic
move of sending his troops into the Rhineland.
The Conference for the Reduction and Limita-
tion of Armaments was already in abeyance be-
fore 1936 and the pa ers in the present volume
record the fruitless e orts to renew work on dis-
armament. Documentation on the London Naval
Conference tells of efforts to meet the situation
created by the withdrawal of Japan from the Con-
ference followin the rejection of a common up-
per limit in nava strength. A limited treat was
signed on March 25, 1936, between the nited
States, members of the British Commonwealth,
and France. While this treaty did not rovide
for uantitative limitation, letters were exc anged
on t e same day between the head of the Ameri-
can delegation, Norman Davis and the British
Foreign Minister, Anthony Eden, recording an
understandin that the princi le of naval parity
between the nited States and the British Com-
monwealth should remain unchan ed and that
there should be no competitive bui ding between
the two powers (p. 99).
The march of Hitler’s troops into the Rhineland
on March 7, 1936, and its potential effects form the
chief subject of the papers printed under the tltle
“Analyses and reports by American diplomatic
missions regarding European political develop-
ments affecting the preservation of peace” (pp.
180—389). American diplomats rightly assessed
this move as a potential step in preparation for a
program of aggression. At that time, however,
events in Euro e were more a matter of concern
to the United tates than an occasion for action.
The plea of French Foreign Minister Flandin for
a statement by the President or Secretary of State
condemning on moral grounds the repudiation of
a treaty was turned down ( p. 217, 228). To a
message from Ambassador gosephus Daniels in
Mexico urging the President to tender good of-
ﬁces, the reply was an expression of hope that no
drastic action would be necessary ( p. 219, 237).
When the League of Nations Counci met in Lon-
don to consider the crisis, the American Char 6
was instructed not to attend as a visitor (p. 244% .
The osition of the United States was ex lained
by Uiider Secretary of State William Phi lips to
the Turkish Ambassador in the words “we could
not become involved in purely European politics”
(p. 245).
Ambassador William E. Dodd at Berlin was
inclined to blame the isolationism of the United
States for the pro ess of aggression. In a tele-
gram be innin “ lease show the President” he
connecte Hit er’s action with the failure to
stop a ression against Ethio ia, including “the
Hoare- Javal performance an the news that the
United States washed its hands for 00d and have
nothing at all to do with Europe” pp. 249—250).
In December Ambassador William C. Bullitt
reported from Paris that he had been consulted by
the German Ambassador, Count von Welczeck,
on the prospects of reaching a full understanding
with France but apparently nothing came of the
move (pp. 380—381, 382).
Aside from problems of armament and threats
to peace, the multilateral subjects treated in the
General section of this volume include negotiations
for the suppression of liquor smuggling into the
United States and on a number of economic prob-
lems. The section on the British Commonwealth
deals entirely with commercial matters, especially
with the eﬂ'orts of Secretary of State Hull to secure
the cooperation of the British Government in
his international trade rogram.
Volwme I, General, T e British Commonwealth
is the second to be issued in the series of ﬁve For-
eign Relations volumes for the year 1936, Volume
III, The Near East and Africa having been pre-
viously published. The remaining three volumes
will be released within the next few weeks. Vol-
ume I was compiled in the Historical Division by
George Verne Blue, a former staﬂ' member, and
Matilda F. Axton and Shirley L. Phillips under
the direction of E. R. Perkins, Editor of Foreign
Relations. Technical editin was in char e of
Elizabeth A. Vary, Chief o the Foreign la-
tions Editing Branch of the Division of Publica-
tions. Copies of this volume (LXXV, p . 892)

Documents Government Printing Ofﬁce, Wash-
