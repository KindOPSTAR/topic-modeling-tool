it is with a profound sense of loss that I express my
deepest sympathy to the Royal Family and people of
Saudi Arabia upon the death of their illustrious father
and ruler. King Abdul Aziz al Saud. His Majesty's states
manship and sagacity as a ruler endeared him to the
hearts of his people and won him universal renown.
The American people were proud to count him and his
nation among their most trusted and valued friends.
On this solemn occasion I wish to extend to Your Ma}
esty, as your father's worthy successor, my good wishes
upon your accession to the throne.
Sudan Elections
Another example of growing American interest
in the Middle East was the presence of a U.S.
re resentative, Warwick Perkins, on the Mixed
E ectoral Commission, which supervised the elec-
tions held in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan beginning
November 15, 1953. Thanks to the work of that
Commission and to the spirit shown by the Suda-
nese, the elections went forward relatively
smoothly. In s ite of the fact that it was the ﬁrst
election in whic most of the voters participated,
it would seem that most of the Sudanese were
accorded, insofar as their stage of political de-
velopment permitted, the maximum freedom in
casting their votes and adequate information on
which to base their choice of candidates. These
Sudanese elections marked another step in the
growing political maturity of the Middle East.
As the Assistant Secretary said at Asilomar,
The clock of history cannot be turned forward by a
mere twist of the dial. The evolution of the dependent
peoples toward full selfsdetermination requires patience,
imagination, and hard work—hard work by the governing
powers as well as the governed—accompanied by sym-
pathy and assistance from all nations. We as Americans
are prepared to do what we can as a part of this effort.
Important Visitors
Final examples of our closening ties with the
countries of the Middle East were several im-
portant visits. These included the Governor Gen-
era] of Pakistan, who came to this count on
October 30, 1953. King Paul and Queen red-
erika of Greece came to this country on October
28. During their 5-week visit they met with a
very large number of important ﬁgures in politi-
cal and private life, were wi ely acclaimed
throughout the country, and did much to arouse
even greater American interest in the progress
being made in Greece.
Then, 2 days a , President Celal Bayar of
Turkey and his wi e arrived in this country for a
4sweek good will tour, which has already aroused
widespread interest.
The end of 1953 was marked by the visit of Vice
President Nixon to the Middle East. In a tele-
vision address on December 23, Mr. Nixon stated
that he felt the peoples of Asia wanted independ-
ence, economic progress, and peace along with
freedom of choice as to their culture, reli ion, and
economic systems—in other words, “a fun amental
recognition of their equal dignity as human
beings.” These words, I feel summarize present
U. S. thinking on the Middle ast.
Current Problems
Morocco. So much for the developments of the
last year. There are in addition a number of con-
tinuing problems to which the Department is
giving its attention. One of these is the recent
incident in the Spanish Morocco Zone, inVolving
the relationship of the Sultan of Morocco with the
local Caids and Pashas. This situation is part
of the problem of colonialism in Morocco and
Tunisia.
As Mr. Byroade said in his speech of last
October—
The United States Government believes that this com-
plicated problem must be resolved primarily by the parties
concerned. There is always a danger that the injection
of outside inﬂuence into a situation of this kind will make
it worse. . . . We know of the delicate problem that the
Government of France confronts in view of the large
French population in this area. We agree that the local
system of government in North Africa needs change be-
fore it can cope with present world conditions or guaran-
tee social progress. We have important security interests
in the strength of the French nation, as well as deep
friendship for the French people. We also have a iirm
policy of supporting the right of dependent peoples to
self—determination. . . . The present situation therefore
calls frankly for a middle-of-the-road policy which will
permit us to determine our position on practical issues
on their merits as they arise. ()ur fundamental
interests can be served only by an arrangement which is
mutually satisfactory to both the French and the North
Africans.
Suez Base. With regard to the problem of the
Suez Base negotiations, one must not overlook the
fact that this has been an overriding problem be-
tween Egypt and Britain for a considerable period
of time and that its settlement has not been a sim-
ple matter of accomplishment. Nevertheless, con-
siderable progress has been made in the course of
the past few months, and nearly all of the issues
0; real substance have, we believe, been disposed
o .
The United States has not participated in these
negotiations but has endeavored to be of what help
it could to its friends. We reco ize the impor-
tancc which E pt attaches to t e base in terms
of her own national pride and aspirations; and we
are in agreement with the British concerning the
strate ic im ortance of the area and the necessity
that t e facilities of the base be available to the
free world in the event of Communist gression.
These considerations have guided us in our in-
formal discussions with the British and the Egyp-
tians. \Ve believe that the remaining issues must
be settled and can be resolved with good will on
both sides. We are convinced that the British and
Egyptians both are sincere in wanting an agree-
ment at this time and that both have much to gain
in terms of an early settlement. Conversely, fail-
ure to reach an agreement would have far-reach-
ing eﬁ'ects, particularly in Egypt where the
