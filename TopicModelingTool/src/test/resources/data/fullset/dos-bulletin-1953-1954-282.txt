Trade Relations and Japanese Economy
by Frank A. Waring 1
Japan today has 87 million people living in an
area slightly smaller than that of the State of
California. It is difficult to ima ine, but if the
Philip ines were as densely settle , it would have
68 million people, or more than three times your
present opulation. Californians would number
93.5 million, or 60 percent of the entire population
of the United States. And the population of
Japan is growing at the rate of 1.2 million each
year.
Only one-seventh of the area of Ja )an can be
cultivated. There are, in fact, 15 m1 lion acres
of farmland and 6 million farm families. The
average landholding, therefore, is 2.5 acres, or
about one hectare, per family. Indeed, on the
basis of arable land, the density of population is
4,000 to the square mile.
Only because land is so scarce, J a anese farmers,
by intensive cultivation and ap leation of fer-
tilizer, manage to extract from t 1e soil maximum
yields. In rice, for example, roduction averages
80 bushels per acre comparedp with an average of
50 bushels in the United States, 25 bushels in the
Philippines, and a little more than 20 bushels in
India.
Despite such high yields, however, Japan cus-
tomarily must import 20 percent of its food supply
at an annual cost of $600 million, which is equiva-
lent to about 50 percent of the value of its current

But in this matter, as in others we should not

exports. Unfortunately, the ﬁgure will be higher
this year. Because of a very cool summer, the
harvest of rice last fall was about 20 percent below
the previous yield, entailing a loss of 2 million
tons. As a result Japan must import at least an
additional 1.5 million tons of assorted grains
(rice, wheat, and barley at a probable cost of
about $200 million. An this loss has been aug-
mented by disastrous ﬂoods which stripped rice
paddies of top soil, inﬂicting property damage
estimated at $500 million.
But food is not the only essential im ort for
Japan, which nature endowed with very ew nat-
ural resources. Nearly all of the raw materials
for its industries must be rocured largely, if not
entirely, from abroad. hese include iron ore,
coking coal, petroleum, bauxite, co per, lumber,
wood pulp, raw cotton, and wool. uch products
are essential to maintain the Ja unese economy in-
ternally and make possible t e production of
goods for export to pay for the necessary food
and raw materials obtained from foreign coun-
tries. It is fair to say that Japan’s chief eXport,
its chief contribution to foreign trade in exchange
for the products it requires, is its labor and its
technical skills. It is also true that Japan must
export to live.
