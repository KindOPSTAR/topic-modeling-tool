The Importance of the European Defense Community to the Free World
by Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.
U.S. Representative to the United Nations1
To me any Franco-American meetin is always
something special—something stimulating, inter-
esting, and valuable.
To Americans who think in terms of the arts,
of culture, and of graceful living, France is
eternally fascinating.
To Americans who think in terms of history, of
statesmanship, of strategy, France is eternally
important.
Both nations have such strong common interests
that it is odd to read in the papers, as we have
lately, of those who get discouraged about the situ-
ation. To those of us who have known France
for a long time it is never possible to get pessi-
mistic, and it is in that spirit, as one who has
known France for a long time and who does not
get pessimistic, that I speak to you today.
My own associations and memories 0 back to
school days before the First World \ ar. As a
boy I played in the Champs Elysées. I saw the
annual wreath-laying ceremony at the base of the
statue of Strasbourg in the Place de la Concorde
and. inescapably, absorbed some of the spirit
which that movmg event symbolized. I can re-
member well the strength and vigor of France.
In fact, there are events which occurred then
which are more vivid to me than many things
which ha pened last week. In particular, I re-
member t 1e mobilization in 1914 when the drums
beat in every French village, when the farmers
brought their horses into the central market place
to turn them over to the Army and to be branded.
It was a drumbeat which marked the beginning
of 4 years of heroic ﬁghting by the armies of
France—ﬁghting which was in the interests of all
free peo les and which was of such bloody in-
tensity t iat it left its tragic imprint for genera-
tions.
So much has been said and written about the fall
of France in 1940 that the remarkable resurgence
of France and the heroic accomplishments of
‘Address made before the France-America Society at
New York on Apr. 21 (U.S./U.N. press release 1908).
French resistance after that tragic date are some-
times overlooked.
It so happens that I was in the vicinity of Bir
Hacheim 1n the Libyan desert when General
Koenig and the Free French made their heroic
stand on the southern end of the British mineﬁeld
a ainst General Rommel’s attempt to come around
t at important ﬂank in the sprin of 1942.
Later I was side by side with t e French Expe-
ditionary Corps in Italy where it made such a
valiant record of vi orous offense.
In the summer 0 1944 occurred the landing in
Southern France, and I went ashore with the
troops of the 9th Colonial Infantr Division
which, I believe, was the ﬁrst French ivision in
the Southern France operation to set foot on the
soil of France. The French troops liberated Teu-
lon and Marseilles and, with their American com-
rades in arms, advanced up the valle of the
Rhone—and the hospitable welcome w llCh was
extended to us Americans by the pee le of France
at that time is something which wi 1 always live
in our memories. It was intensely memorable and
intensely touching.
That hospitable welcome was something unique
in my ex erience. So also was the strength of the
French Iibsistance Movement. It was so well or-
ganized all through that part of France that Ger-
man forces were in many lar areas denied the
use of the roads. The FrencﬁeResistance Move-
ment was a powerful ally to the armies which were
liberatin Southern France.
Later t ese French forces grew. They grew into
the Army Detachment of the Alps under the com-
mand of General Doyen, which held the Franco-
Italian border.
There was also the Army Detachment of the At-
lantic under the command of General de Larminat,
which contained the German forces in the Atlantic
pockets and eventually destroyed them.
Then there was the First French Army com-
manded by that great Frenchman, Marsha] de Lat-
tre—who was later to become in great friend—
which went from the beaches of outhern France
