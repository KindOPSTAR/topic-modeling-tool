tons of metal and would be due on such date as
the Council might decide. Producing countries
would be liable for two subsequent contribution
each equivalent in the ag ate to 5,000 tons 0
metal. Unless the Council ecided otherwise by
concurrent ma'orities, counted separately the ﬁrst
of these woul be due as soon as the buﬁ'er stock
held 10,000 tons of metal and the second as soon
as the butl'er stock held 15,000 tons. The contri-
bution b each producing country would be pro-
portiona to its percentage as shown in annex A.
If any producing country failed to fulﬁll its
obligation to provide capital to the butl'er stock, the
Council would be authorized to deprive that coun-
try of rights and privileges under the agreement
and to uire the other producin countries to
make gorgg the deficit. Upon remedy of such de-
fault, the Council could restore the rights and
privileges and return the additional contributions
made by other producing countries.
Any participating country would be entitled to
make voluntary contributions of cash or tin metal
to the bu ﬁ'er stock. The Council could reduce the
obligatory contributions by amounts not exceeding
the aggregate of any volunta contributions pro-
vided this action was favore by concurrent ma-
jorities, counted separately; was desired by the
producing country or countries whose obligatory
contributions would be reduced; and would not
invglve the repayment of any contributions already
ma e.
Operatlcn at the lutch Stock
If the price of cash tin on the London Metal
Exchange becomes as high as the ceiling price, the
agreement requires the mana r of the buﬂ‘er
stock to offer all of the tin at his disposal for sale
on the Exchange at that price. As long as the
buffer stock has tin, the manager is also required
in these circumstances to accept bids at the ceiling
price, adjusted for location and such other factors
as may be determined by the chairman, provided
these bids are received from consumers in partici-
ating countries or agents acting directly on their
half. The agreement further provides that the
minimum tonnage of all such transactions shall
be 5 tons; larger tonnages shall be in multiples of
5 tons, and the manager, in accepting such direct
bids, shall have regard to the fair and equitable
disposal of the tin in the buffer stock.
If the price of cash tin on the London Metal
Exchange becomes as low as the ﬂoor price, the
manager must offer to buy cash tin on the Ex-
change at that price if he has funds at his disposal.
In the u )er third or lower third, respectively,
of the stabilization range the manager would have
discretion to offer tin or buy cash tin on the Ex-
change at the market price if he considered such
operations necessary to prevent the market from
rising or falling too steeply. The manager would
not be allowed to buy or sell if the price of cash
tin on the Exchange were in the middle third of
the stabilization range unless the Council decided
otherwise by a majority of the producer votes and
a majority of the consumer votes.
The agreement authorizes the manager, within
the framework of the general instructions he may
have received to buy or sell 3 months’ tin on the
London Metal Exchan and to buy or sell, cash
or forward, on any 0t or established market for
tin at any time when he may buy or sell cash tin
on the London Metal Exchange.
If the funds at the disposal of the manager
were inadequate to meet the ex nses of his oper-
ations, the Council could aut orize him to sell
sutlicient tin at the market price to meet his cur-
rent operational ex enditures, notwithstanding
other provisions of e agreement.
Revolution at Currencies
The agreement provides for the Council to meet
immediately if a review of the price limits is
made necessary by movements in the relative value
of currencies. Pending such a meeting, the chair-
man would suspend provisionally the operations
of the buffer stock if this was necessary to prevent
buying or sellin to an extent likely to prejudice
the pur oses of tghe a reement.
T e ouncil is aut orized to suspend, or con-
ﬁrm the sus ension of, buffer stock operations if
two-thirds oi) the votes cast by roducing countries
or two-thirds of the votes cast by consuming coun-
tries are in favor of such a course. Buﬂ'er stock
operations, if provisionally suspended, would be
resumed in the absence of such a majority. A
suspension of buffer stock operations would not
prevent the Council from continuing to exercise
its authority for the control of ex orts as provided
elsewhere in the agreement. Wit in 30 days after
a decision to suspend, or conﬁrm the suspension of,
butler stock operations, the Council would con-
sider provisional ﬂoor and ceiling prices. The
Council is authorized to determine provisional
price limits by concurrent majorities of producer
votes and consumer votes, counted separately.
Provisional prices would be reviewed within 90
days b the Council, which could determine new
price imits by concurrent majorities, counted
separately. If at one meeting the Council was
unable to determine provisional ﬂoor and ceiling
prices, it could nevertheless determine new price
imits at any subsequent meetin , with the same
majorities bein required. Bu er stock 0 re.-
tions, if sus en ed, would be resumed on the asis
of ﬂoor an ceil' prices whenever these were
determined by the uncil, provisionally or other-
Wise.
