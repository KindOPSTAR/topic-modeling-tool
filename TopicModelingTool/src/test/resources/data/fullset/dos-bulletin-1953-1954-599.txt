chosen for this pur ose the most fundamental of
all these disputes, t a one most detrimental to the
renaissance that seems overdue in the area and the
one which seems least ca able of early and satis-
factory solution. I re er to the Arab-Israeli
situation.
You are, of course, aware of the general factors
underlying the establishment of Israel. In lend-
ing their support, the American people acted in
large measure out of sympathy and horror at the
outrages committed against the Jewish people in
Europe during the past 25 years.
The people of the Arab States have cried out
a ainst this action of the United States. The
birth of the tragic Arab refu ee problem out of
the Palestine conﬂict has ad ed to the real and
deep-seated bitterness which replaced, to some
extent at least, an earlier faith in the United
States. The emotions which surround this prob-
lem in the Middle East are so tense that any
immediate or dramatic solution of the problem is
impossible. Even progress toward solution of any
se ment of the problem is at best exceedingly difﬁ-
cu t. Yet I am convinced that the United States
must, in its own interests, devote a major effort
toward easing the tensions that have sprun from
this situation. There is today a blocka e, one
might say almost an iron curtain, between the Arab
States and Israel. In these circumstances new
generations of youth are being brought up in iso-
ation and cannot judge for themselves the truth of
the propaganda falling on their ears. It is a
situation which, if not corrected, has in it the seeds
of still more disastrous conﬂict in the Middle East.
What are the cases of the two sides of this dis-
pute? Here are the views of David, who migrated
to Israel and is now an Israeli citizen, and the
views of Ahmed, a citizen of an Arab State near
the Israel borders.
1'"! ISRAELI CASE
David sees in Israel’s creation the fulﬁllment
of the pro hecy of Ezekiel (XXXVII, 21), “Be-
hold, I will)take the children of Israel from among
the heathen, whither they be gone, and will gather
them on every side, and bring them into their
own land.” This lends a mystical force to the
work of David and other founders of Israel.
David declares that the present borders of
Israel, including the additional territory beyond
the line recommended by the United Nations par-
tition resolution of 1947, are the result of the con-
ﬂict provoked by the Arabs’ unsuccessful assault
on the new state. Any signiﬁcant change to the
detriment of Israel in these frontiers, which were
won by Israeli blood, would therefore be to him
unthinkable and unjust.
It follows in his thinking that the refugee prob-
lem was not created by Israel. He maintains the
Arabs of Palestine were induced to ﬂee in large
numbers as part of a deliberate policy of their
leaders, which backﬁred. He believes they were
told that their exodus would assist in crippling
Israel and that after a few weeks of ﬁghting the
would return on the heels of the victorious Ara
armies. He re eats often the charge that, instead
of caring for t eir own, the Arab States actually
obstruct refugee resettlement, forcing these un-
fortunate peo le to rot in camps and endeavoring
to use their p ight as a vehicle through which to
appeal to world sympathies. By contrast, he says
Israel has 0 ened her doors to over 700,000 immi-
grants. In is eyes, Israel deserves world support
since it has lifted from the world’s conscience
the burden of determining what should be done
with Jewish victims of anti-Semitic persecution,
as throu h heavy sacriﬁce the eople of Israel,
assisted y world Jewry, are integrating these
refugees into Israel, creating for them new homes
and means of livelihood. He feels an obli ation
to provide a haven for still further Jewish immi-
grants, either to rescue them from ersecution or
even perhaps to strengthen Israel y increasmg
her population.
David maintains that the possibility of the re-
turn of Arab refugees to Israel in appreciable
numbers no longer exists. Their land as been
taken up. However, he points out that ample land
and water both exist in the Arab States which
could be made available to these Palestinians.
In addition, he states their return would present
an unacceptable security problem, particularly in
the face of the continued hostility of Israel’s
neighbors. He says Israel is, however, willing to
aSSist in their reintegration elsewhere. Certain
blocked funds have already been released to the
Arab refugees, and he says Israel is prepared, by
paying compensation, to contribute economically
to their integration in the Arab countries.
He says water means life for Israel’s economy;
prospects for self-sufficiency depend upon full de-
velopment of available water resources. DaVId
maintains that obstructionist Arab policies and a
dog-in-manger attitude therefore cannot be per-
mitted to stop irrigation plans. In his eyes the
Arab States possess am 1e water resources of their
own; why then should t ey lay claim to the meager
streams to which Israel has access?
To David, the soul of Israel is in Jerusalem, a
city to which generations of Jews have lon ed
to return. To surrender control of new J erusa em
to any other entity he would see as out of the
question. He notes that the Christian and Mos-
lem holy laces, in which the world religious com-
munity as a legitimate interest, are largely
concentrated in the areas now held by Jordan.
He says Israel is willing to give the ﬁrmest guaran-
ties with respect to holy places within the territory
under its control and is willing to provide free
access to them but is unwilling to trust the lives
of Jewish citizens to some nonexistent interna-
tional force.
For safety from its threatening neighbors, he
