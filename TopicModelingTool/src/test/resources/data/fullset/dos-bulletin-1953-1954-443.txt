The Declaration of Caracas and
the Monroe Doctrine
News Conference Statement by Secretary Dulles
Press release 138 dated March 16
I returned last Sunday from Caracas after 2
weeks of attendance at the Tenth Inter-American
Conference. The Conference is still in session.
It has many important matters to deal with, par-
ticularly in the social and economic ﬁeld. Al-
read , however, the Conference has made history
by adopting with only one negative vote a declara-
tion that, if the international communism move-
ment came to dominate or control the political
institutions of any American State, that would
constitute a threat to the sovereignty and political
inde ndence of all the American States and
wou d endanger the peace of America.1
That declaration reﬂects the thinking of the
early part of the nineteenth century. At that
time, Czarist Russia was aggressive. Czar Alex-
ander had made a claim to sovereignty along the
West Coast of this Continent and had organized
the so-called Holy Alliance which was plotting to
impose the despotic political system of Russia and
its allies upon the American Republics, which had
just won their freedom from Spain.
In 1823, President Monroe, in his message to
Congress, made his famous declaration. It con-
tained two major points. The ﬁrst related to the
colonial system of the allied powers of Europe
and declared that any extension of their colonial
system in this hemisphere would by dangerous to
our peace and safety. The second part of the dec-
laration referred to the extension to this hemi-
sphere of the political system of despotism then
represented by Czarist Russia and the Holy Al-
liance. President Monroe declared that “it is im-
possible that the allied powers should extend their

political system to any portion of either continent
without endangerin our peace and happiness. It
is equally impossib e, therefore, that we should
behold such interposition, in any form, with indif-
ference.” _
The ﬁrst part of President Monroe’s declaration
against extending the European colonial system
in this hemisphere has long since been accepted
and made an all-American policy by concerted
action of the American States. However, the
same could not be said of President Monroe’s
declaration against the extension to this hemi-
sphere of a European despotic system. It seemed
to me, as I planned for the Caracas conference,
that the threat which stems from international
communism is a repetition in this centu of re-
cisely the kind of danger against which resi ent
Monroe had made his famous declaration 130
years ago. It seemed of the utmost importance
that, just as part of the Monroe declaration had
long since been turned from a unilateral declara-
tion into a multilateral declaration of the Ameri-
can States, so it would be appropriate for the
American States to unite to dec are the danger to
them all which would come if international com—
munism seized control of the political institutions
of any American State.
That matter was debated at Caracas for 2 weeks
and a declaration in the sense proposed by the
United States was adopted by a vote of 17 to 1,
with 2 abstentions.
I believe that this action, if it is properly backed
up, can have a profound eﬁ'ect in preserving this
hemisphere from the evils and woes that would
befall it if any one of our American States became
a Soviet Communist puppet. That would be a
disaster of incalculable proportions. It would
disrupt the growing unity of the American States
which is now reﬂected by the Charter of the
Americas and by the Rio Treaty of Reciprocal
Assistance.
It was time that we should have acted as we did
because international communism is making great
efforts to extend its political control to this hemi-
sphere. The declaration adopted at Caracas, and
particularly the sentiments which were expressed
during the course of the debate, show an aware-
ness of the danger'and a resolution to meet it.
It is signiﬁcant of the vitality of our American
system that no one of the American Republics,
even the most powerful, wanted to deal single-
handedly with the danger, but that it was brought
to the Inter-American Conference table as a
matter of common concern. Furthermore, the
declaration, as adopted, contained in substance
the words of President Eisenhower, expressed in
his great peace address of April 16, 1953, that the
declaration “is designed to protect and not to im-
pair the inalienable right of each American State
freely to choose its own form of government and
economic system and to live its own social and
cultural life.”
