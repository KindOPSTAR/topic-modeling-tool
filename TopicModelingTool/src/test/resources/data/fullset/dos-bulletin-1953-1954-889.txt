International Unity
Address by Secretary Dulles 1
It is inspiring to see here the representatives
of many different countries. You are here because
you share the ideals represented by the Rotary
International. Thus diversity manifests unity.
Diversity often seems a troublesome fact.
But the richness of life is, above all, due to dif-
ferences. No two human beings are exactly
alike. Each of us is in this sense a minority—
a minority of one. On the other hand, there
are elements of likeness which bind all mankind
together in the brotherhood of a single human
famil .
Thgre is no roblem more difficult than that
of trying to bui d unity on a foundation of diver-
sity. I often have to s eak of that at congres-
sional hearings which eal with appropriations
for mutual security and foreign aid. I have there
emphasized that we should not limit our friend]
cooperation to those who agree with us on a1
points. A free society, I have pointed out, implies
difference.
I am sometimes struck by the fact that those
abroad who differ most violently from us are the
same ones who most violently criticize the fact that
we in the United States often differ among our-
selves.
On the other hand we must not be blind to the
fact that differences can mount to a point where
they become a real danger. The degree of dif-
ference that is tolerable depends on the degree
of peril, and there come times when differences
must be voluntarily submerged.
Perhaps today t ere is too much difference be-
tween the members of the non-Communist world.
Certainly the differences seriously multiply the
burden of conducting foreign affairs.
However, we can rejoice in the fact that we
can maintain the lofty goal of fruitful coexistence
between difference and unity. The Communists
have given 11 in despair trying to achieve that
goal. They have adopted a materialistic creed

which exalts conformity and which treats human
differences as evils to be forcibly suppressed. The
dictatorship of the roletariat determines what
each individual shaleo, where and how he and
she shall work, what they shall think, and what
they shall believe. In that way, they get a kind of
unity. It is, however, a unit which is bought at
a disastrous price, the price 0 denying the dignity
and worth of the individual human being.
Rather than pay that price, we should accept
all the burdens and the frequent failures which
inevitably result from trying to combine unity and
diversity. Also, we can know that in this matter
time works for us. There are circumstances under
which conformity can be imposed, perhaps for
long. But no iron disci line, no police state sys-
tem, can overcome the spiritual and natural forces
which make men different. Those who stake their
future on enforced conformity are bound to fail.
The United Nations
It is, however, not enough to rejoice in our dif-
ference. We must ﬁnd ways whereby, despite
differences, we can cooperate. In an era when
science has almost obliterated distance, it is in-
evitable that men should create institutions for
association. The most signiﬁcant cooperative
effort is the United Nations.
Personally I have a great attachment to the
United Nations. I was a member of the United
States delegation which drew u the charter. I
have attended six out of the eiglit sessions of the
General Assembly.
I can assure you that President Eisenhower and
his administration support wholeheartedly the
United Nations. We intend to avail ourselves of
its processes wherever they are relevant to the
problems which engage us.
There are, I know, many who are discouraged
about the United Nations because they feel it
represents too much difference. Some would pre-
fer to have the membership reduced so that the
residual would represent greater conformity. I
