Just as the basic Atomic Energy Act reco nized

The destiny of all nations during the 20th cen-

STATEMENT OF FEBRUARY 12
Press release 69 dated February 15
“'e are here today in a meeting which may have
historic consequences. From it may come the kind
of accomplishment which the whole world has
been expecting of this conference; but which after
nearly 3 weeks has not yet been forthcoming.
Some may explain and even excuse our failure
to date on t 0 ground that the roblems and tasks
we have previously undertaken ave been vast and
complex. Such is not the case today.
In agenda item No. 3, the conclusion of an
Austrian State Treaty, we have a problem of com-
pletely manageable magnitude.
In the occasional moments of meditation which
this conference has permitted, I have given
thought to the dilemmas which seem to confront
our Soviet collea es. I try to see their prob-
lems from their Viewpoint, and I admit that they
face hard problems.
But no stretch of philosophical speculation can
bring me to believe that Austria constitutes a
really hard problem. Surely the mi hty Soviet
empire cannot really fear lest 7 miﬁion peace-
lovmg Austrians should have freedom. Nor can
I believe that the economy of the 800 million

It seems incredible that a Soviet grocer’s bill for
some dried peas should have stood in the way of
honoring the 1943 signature of the Soviet Foreign
Minister to the Moscow declaration of Austria’s
independence!
\Ve have just heard the statement of the Aus-
trian Foreign Minister.
Immediate Solution Needed
We agree that the Austrian problem does not
simply call for eventual solution; it cries aloud
for immediate solution, no matter what measure-
ment of politics or economics or humanity or in-
ternational decency is applied to it. “'hat is
asked for is nothing more than what was solemnly
promised over 10 years ago—the rights of sov-
ereignty we all insist u on for ourselves. Fur-
thermore, the gap whicli separates the Austrian
Minister’s plea from realization is so small that
this treaty could be signed here and now, if all
four of us had the will to sign it. I for one do
have that will, and I note that each of us has
in statements at this conference recognized our
obligation to act and act quickly. Mr. Molotov
put it well when on January 25, 1954, he said
“the interests of strengthening peace in Euro
and the need to assure the national rights of ti:
Austrian people demand the earliest re-establish-
ment of a free and independent Austria.” The
call of the Austrian Foreign Minister is a call
to action to which we must respond quickly for
many reasons.
