and accept employment in the United States. This
is in accordance with Department policy and with
the strong recommendation of the Korean Gov-
ernment that Korean students return immediately
to he] in the rehabilitation of their count upon
comp etion of their studies. Thirty-two orean
students have been assisted under this program, 11
of whom were aided within the past 6 months.
In the Other Amerlcan Republlcs
Recognizing that the inter-American system
must be founded on mutual knowledge, under-
standing, and respect, the person-to-person a
proach of educational exchange was determined in
1938 to be one of the most direct ways to achieve
this. The coo eration and mutual respect which
now characterize our relations with Latin Ameri-
can countries stem in large measure from the
cumulative effect of personal contact afforded by
exchanges over a period of 15 years. An intensive
study conducted in Brazil, for example, by an
independent research organization concluded that
amonglthe major effects of the exchange experience
are a igher regard for the North American peo-
ple, greater conviction that the United States is a
true democracy, and an increase in the belief that
we are doing more than any other nation to prevent
war.
It is nevertheless necessary to recognize that to-
da anti-U.S. propaganda is making a determined
eﬂ'iirt in Latin America to ca italize on every
motive for misunderstanding. (lbmmunist propa-
nda is making special use of the Soviets own
ind of exchange of persons program, which in-
cludes invitations to inﬂuential Latin American
ﬁgures in press and labor circles for “guided tours”
behind the Iron Curtain.
The Department is now carrying out nearly 200
exchanges with 22 countries in this area. Among
the 35 Americans who visited Latin America re-
cently with Hilton R. Hanna, a labor leader, who
met with all levels of workers and management,
stressing—in excellent Spanish—the theme of
good labor-management relations for expanding
production.
The visit of this eminent American Negro
prompted one high union ofﬁcial to reexamine
anti-U.S. propaganda in regard to race relations
and to seek help from the local U.S. mission in
getting the facts on the Negro in America.
An American economist served as consultant to
a Central American government and lectured on
economics at a university. An American profes-
sor furthered the establishment of a new Depart-
ment of Library Science at a Brazilian university,
meanwhile conducting, at the request of local gov-
ernment ofﬁcials, a training program for librar-
ians throughout the area.
In addition to the 72 Latin American students
brought to study in American colleges and uni-
versities, grantees included 91 teachers, lecturers,
and inﬂuential leaders, including the Chief Justice
of Peru, the Ecuadoran President’s assistant and
liaison contact with the Ecuadoran Congress, and
a Brazilian editor and radio broadcaster.
An important part of the program in Latin
America is assistance to 230 nonproﬁt American-
sponsored schools, representing a private invest-
ment of $6,500,000. This program, recently
praised hi hly by Dr. Milton Eisenhower, in-
cludes smal cash grants and professional guid-
ance on curricula and other services, amountin
to $132,250 this year. In spite of the smaﬁ
amount of money involved, the pro rain has
stimulated these schools to maintain .S. stand-
ards of teaching and school administration.
Private groups carried out 632 exchanges in
furtherance of the De artment’s exchange objec-
tives in this area. or example, a group of
Cleveland, Ohio, clubwomen made a tour of six
Latin American countries, with the assistance
of our Foreign Service posts and the Department.
In the ﬁeld of sports, the Department assisted an
American baseball team to play a series of games
with a Mexican team, and arrangements were
made for players from Mexico and Cuba to par-
ticipate in the Brooklyn Dodgers Baseball School
in Florida.
The Department continued to assist a large
number of Latin American students in arranging
trips to this country. By way of illustration,
arrangements were made for 63 engineering stu-
dents and 3 faculty members from the National
University of Colombia and 60 students from the
University of Mexico to visit places of technical
interest in the United States. The Department
also assisted the National Education Association
in arranging educational tours to Latin America
for a large number of American teachers.
PUBLIC SUPPORT OF PROGRAM
Partlelpatlon of Prlvate U. 5. Citizens
The cooperation of the American public has
contributed substantially to the success of the ex-
change program. Hundreds of organizations and
thousands of individuals have offered hospitality
and professional guidance to these foreign visitors
without remuneration.
American citizens who invite an exchangee
“home for dinner” or into the family circle are
playing a signiﬁcant part in developing the ob-
jectives of the program.
Such hospitality is a two-way street in that it,
is frequently equally rewarding to the hosts. The
word “foreigner” loses all alien connotations to
the family where an exchangee has become a fre-
quent visitor. Barriers of different cultures go
down before this person-to-person contact. In
