The existing treaty network is rounded out by
30 treaties entered into at various times before
World War II which are still in effect in whole
or in greater part. Fourteen of these treaties were
entered into during the period between the two
world wars, as art of a program initiated by
Charles Evans Ifiighes while he was Secretary of
State. The remainder were concluded at various
times during the 19th centu _ or the ﬁrst years of
this century; in fact, 11 of Itiiem were negotiated
over 100 years ago. These various treaties, while
dealing with the same general range of subject
matter, were concluded over a long span of time
and under widely differing circumstances and con-
sequently vary greatly from the standpoint of re-
sponsiveness to the requirements of present-day
economic intercourse.
