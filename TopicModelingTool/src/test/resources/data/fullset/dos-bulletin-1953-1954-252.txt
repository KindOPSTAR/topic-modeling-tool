A Foreign Policy for the Long Haul
by Under Secretary Smith ‘
It is a very special honor to be your guest this
evening. To me it is a wonderful thing that in
these troubled times men gather together to with-
draw for a brief space from worldly pursuits, to
renew their faith, and to strengthen their souls
through meditation and prayer. We are so swe t
along by the tide of events—the press of dai y
roblems is so intense—that the great rspective
is too easil lost. Not only individual); but also
nations an their governments, can be the victims
of these distractions. The therapy of a retreat
might be as effective for the mundane as for the
spiritual vision, and I think that nowhere in the
mundane realm is the need for quiet and constant
rethinking and reassessment greater than in the
sphere of relations among nations. In a violent
and distracted world where events move at an un-
precedented pace; new factors are constantly
emerging; new forces are bein felt, and known
forces are chan 'ng direction. aim and reasoned
'udgment in t e conduct of foreign polic may
ring us success and with it the securit and7 peace
that we have sought so long. Fai ure would
threaten our survival.
The foreign policy of our country is determined
in Washington by the President and his lieuten-
ants. The duty of app] ing that policy to local
situations abroad devo ves upon our Foreign
Service. It is a tremendous res onsibility at any
time, but especially so today. q can assure you
that your country’s representatives abroad are
second to none in competence, in loyalty, and in
devotion to American ideals. In a recent book
Sir Robert Bruce Lockhart, himself a veteran of
40 years of British diplomacy, says:
The career American diplomats are a remarkable body
of men, thoroughly trained for their job, eager, receptive,
more alive to the social convulsions of a changing world
and less conservative in their attitude than many of
their British colleagues. 1 think that ever since 1918
they have been more often right in regard to Europe than
we have.

Today I completed my ﬁrst year of service as
Under Secretary of State, and durin that year
I have had impressed on me time and again the
accuracy of Bruce Lockhart’s statement. I take
this occasion to remind you that by encouragin
your representatives abroad you make a practice
contribution to the success of the work they are
doing, and there has never been a time when it
has been more important that they be in a position
to give their best.
I have spoken of the necessity for frequent and
careful review of the relations between nations and
of our own foreign policy. The objectives of this
policy remain constant—the welfare and the se-
curity of the United States—but as situations
change the rograms desi ed to implement our
policy must he adjusted. The President is keenly
aware of this necessity. Such a review has re-
cently been completed, and the Secretary of State
has announced certain modiﬁcations of polic .
These I would like to discuss with you tonig t
because they hold deep signiﬁcance for us, for our
allies, and for that part of the world which is
hostile to our beliefs and convictions.
Emergency Measures
At the end of \Vorld IVar II it was evident that
the American objectives, the security of the United
States and the preservation of its ideals, required
material and moral reconstruction almost on a
global scale. The war had left widespread devas'
tation, human misery, unrest, and shattered oliti-
cal structures. These conditions are no foun ation
for an international framework of peace. Ac-
cordin ly, we instituted various programs to im-
prove t ie security of the free world and to rovide
a basis upon which a real peace might be liuilt.
Reviewing the past decade, I think it is agreed
that most of the policies we have followed have
been sound. However they were, in general,
emergency measures adopted under ressure to
meet situations imposed by forces outSide our bor-
ders. Our program for economic aid for other
free nations is one example. First, it was of an
