This is the bank’s ﬁrst loan to Norway. It is
for a term of 20 years and bears interest of 4%
percent per annum, including the statutory 1
percent commission which is allocated to the bank’s
special reserve. Amortization will begin in Octo-
ber 1957.
The Norwegian Government has laid down the
main directions of its economic policy for the next
few years in the form of an investment program
covering the period 1954 to 1957. Its general
aim is to maintain a high level of employment
and to raise living standards further b increas-
ing both agricu tural and industria output.
Since the Norwegian economy is based primarily
on private enterprise, this pro ram represents
more an indication of general oijectives than a
lan to be followed in detail. Particular emphasis
is being laid upon export industries, which account
for more than one-third of the country’s total
roduction, and upon shipping which is one of
orway’s major sources of foreign exchange
earnm s.
During the year 1954 more than one~ﬁfth of
total Norwegian investment will be in shi ping.
In general, N orwe ian shipowners have su cient
resources and credit in their own currency to ﬁ-
nance this ex ansion. For the Norwegian econ-
omy as a who e, however, the payments to be made
abroad for ships being built in foreign ards im-
pose a heav§ burden. Largely as a resu t of these
payments, orway will need additional amounts
of forei exchange estimated at the equivalent
of $52 million in 1954. The bank’s loan will cover
$25 million of this amount; the remainder will
come from Norway’s own resources or from
further foreign borrowing.
Norwa is the third maritime nation of the
world. ts merchant ﬂeet is modern and highly
eﬂicient; about two-ﬁfths of the tonnage is less
than 5 years old and more than three-quarters is
diesel driven. The bulk of the vessels operate in
cargo liner service or work on long-term charter
to oil companies, and only a minor number are
tramp ships. Operating costs compare favorably
with ﬂeets of other nations. Although onl about
31,/2 percent of the employed opulatlon is irectly
engaged in shipping, net oreign exchange re-
ceipts from shipping services pay for some 20
to 30 percent 0 imports. Wit the addition of
ships now on order, and allowing for replace-
ments, the merchant ﬂeet is ex cted to be
increased b one-quarter by the en of 1957.
Norway as developed rapidly since the end
of World War II. As a result of large invest-
ments, war losses have been made good and the
country now has considerably more capital equip-
ment that it had before the war. The merchant
ﬂeet is about one-third larger, the ﬁshing and
whaling ﬂeet has been restored and modernized,
agriculture and forestry have been mechanized to
a great extent, and industries and powerplants
have been expanded.
The country’s physical and human resources
provide a broad basis for further growth, but this
growth de ends on an adequate supply of capital.
ecause 0 its small population, Norway’s capital
resources are limited and for more than a centur
the countr has been a net importer of capita .
These fun s have come traditionally from the pri-
vate capital markets of the United Kingdom and
continental Europe. Since World War II the in-
ﬂow of foreign capital has come largely from of-
ﬁcial American aid and private shipping loans.
At the present time, lack of sufﬁcient private for-
eign capital, together with the termination of
American aid, led Norway to seek International
Bank ﬁnancing.
l-‘OA Makes Allotments
to France and Spain
The Foreign Operations Administration on
April 5 announced new allotments of $13,500,000
for Spain and $15,850,000 for France in mutual-
security funds.
The new funds for Spain, in addition to $11
million allotted last November,‘ are made avail-
able under an $85 million defense su port program
for Spain authorized by Congress or the current
ﬁscal ear. This ro am is designed to
strengt en the economlc oundation for the joint
effort of the two nations to build up the military
defenses of Spain. The $13,500,000 allotment
will be used by Spain for the purchase of indus-
trial and agricultural commodities and equipment
to meet requirements of the S anish economy.
The allotment for France, w ich will ﬁnance the
procurement of cotton and tobacco, has been made
under the provisions of Section 550 of the Mutual
Security Act of 1953. This section provides that
between $100 million and $250 million of mutual-
security appropriations for the current ﬁscal year
shall be used to ﬁnance surplus United States agri-
cultural commodities to be sold to friendly coun-
tries for local currencies.
The local currency proceeds may be used by F0».
for an of several urposes speciﬁed by Section
550. n this case, t e equivalent of $10,850,000 in
French francs will be used for offshore procure-
ment by the United States of military equipment
and su plies produced in France. The remaining
$5 miliion equivalent in francs will be invested in
economic development of French dependent terri-
tories in Africa.
F GA has now made available a total of $202,650,-
000 under Section 550 to ﬁnance such surplus com-
modity sales to the United Kingdom Federal
Republic of Germany, Norway, China (P ormosa) ,
Finland, Yugoslavia, Israel, Spain, Afghanistan,
Japan, and France.
