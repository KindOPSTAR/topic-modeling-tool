On October 20 the American-constructed naval
supple and repair base at the Mediterranean rt
of enderon (Alexandretta , which had een
constructed with funds from t 0 Mutual Securit
Agency, was turned over to the Turkis
Government. As President Bayar, of Turkey,
who was to visit the United States in January
1954, '° told the Grand National Ammbly on No-
vember 1, 1953, Turkey was “working earnestly to
make the North Atlantic Treaty Or anization
more effective,” and ho ed that the nited Na-
tions would be “freed rom the obstacles which
presently im de it.” He added that“the close and
cordial relations between Turkey and the United
States” grew “stronger with each da that passes.”
Turkey was receiving “valuable aid rom this pow-
Erfiélfountry, and great understanding in every

The Problem et Iran
The United States was also concerned durin
1953 with the roblems of Iran, involving (1?
the country’s difﬁcult economic and ﬁnancial po-
sition, (2) the normalization of Anglo-Iranian re-
lations, following the break in October 1952, and
(3) the oil controversy.
Even before President Eisenhower’s inaugu-
ration, Prime Minister Mossadegh wrote to him,
on January 9, 1953, asserting that, despite its
friendship for Iran, the United States had pur-
sued what ap cared “to be a licy of supporting
the British overnment” an the Anglo- ranian
Oil Compailiy. U. S. assistance had been given to
the United ingdom but withheld from Iran, and
it seemed that the United States had given “at
least some degree of support to the endeavors of
the British to strangle ran with a ﬁnancial and
economic blockade.’ Dr. Mossadegh then sum-
marized the familiar Iranian position in the oil
controversy and expressed the ope that the new
administration wou “give most careful consider-
ation to the Iranian case so that Iran would be able
to attain its just aspirations in a manner which
will strengthen the cause of world peace and will
renew conﬁdence in the determination of the
United States to support with all its power and
restige the principles of the charter of the United
Nations.” President~Elect Eisenhower responded
the next day, indicating that his own impartiality
had not been compromised in any way and that he
hoped Iranian-American relations would not only
be “completely free of any suspicion” but “char-
acterized by conﬁdence and trust inspired by
frankness and friendliness.”
Dr. Mossadegh communicated with President
Eisenhower again on May 28, once more expressing
his views on the controversy with the United King-
dom, and complaining that no change seemed “thus

far to have taken place in the position of the
American Government.” Among other things, he
recalled that the Iranian Government had been
prepared to pay com nsation to the Anglo-
ranian Oil Company or its properties in Iran,
in such amount as mi ht be determined by the
International Court 0 Justice, although he also
noted that Iran had certain claims against the
Compan . The Prime Minister added that, as a
result 0 actions taken both by the United King-
dom and by the Compan , Iran was “now facing
great economic and political difﬁculties,” and de-
clared that if the situation continued there might
be serious consequences. Althou h Iran was grate-
ful for American assistance, it ad not been suf-
ﬁcient to solve Iranian roblems and insure world
peace, “which is the aim and ideal of the noble
people and of the Government of the United
tates.”
President Eisenhower, who replied on June 29,
reiterated American friendship for Iran and ex-
pressed his hope that Iran would be able to main-
tain its independence and that the Iranian people
would be “successful in realizing their national
aspirations and in develo ing a contented and free
nation which will contribute to world pros rity
and peace.” It was essentially because 0 that
hope that the United States had made earnest ef-
forts to assist in eliminating the Anglo-Iranian
differences which had developed in the oil contro-
versy. But the failure of ran and the United
Kingdom to reach agreement as to com nsation
had handicapped the United States in its eﬁ’orts
to help Iran. As President Eisenhower stated,
there was—
a strong feeling in the United States, even among Ameri-
can citizens most sympathetic to Iran and friendly to the
Iranian people, that it would not be fair to the American
taxpayers (or the United States Government to extend any
considerable amount of economic aid to Iran so long as
Iran could have access to funds derived from the sale of
its oil and oil products it a reasonable agreement were
reached with regard to compensation whereby the lam-
scaie marketing of Iranian oil would be resumed. Simi-
larly. many American citizens Would be deeply opposed to
the purchase by the United States Government of lrauian
oil in the absence of an oil settlement.
The President also indicated that there was con-
siderable American sentiment to the eﬂ'ect that
mere compensation for losses of the physical assets
of a ﬁrm which had been nationalized would not
constitute a “reasonable settlement.” Many be-
lieved that “the most practicable and the fairest
means of settling the question of compensation”
would be to refer it “to some neutral international
body which could consider on the basis of merit
all claims and counter-claims.” The President was
not attempting to advise the Iranian Government
as to its best interests but was trying to explain
why the United States was not “in a position to
extend more aid to Iran or to purchase Iranian
oil.” But if Iran so desired, the United States
hoped to be able “to continue to extend technical
