We have sought and have almost accomplished
the elimination of economic aid in Europe as pure
budgetary support. We feel it is still important
to us in our own interest to provide such help under
a few exceptional circumstances— articularly
where it is necessary to maintain mi itar estab-
lishments which directly beneﬁt us an which
cannot be maintained to the degree deemed desir-
able by our military advisers without some sup-
port from the United States.
The case of Turkey illustrates this oint.
Turkey maintains about 20 divisions of sp endid
ﬁ htin quality at a strategic location. The
urkis economy cannot su port this force with-
out some assistance and, therefore, the Mutual
Security Program includes such help. We believe
that the money spent in this way brings a greater
return to the United States in terms of its own
security than if it were spent in some other way or
if it were not spent at al .
Mlddle East and South Asls
In the Middle East the action of Turkey and
Pakistan in concluding a treaty of friendship and
cooperation provides an important element of
encouragement. It is ood that the concept of
mutual security has ta en hold in this crucial
area. This is an area of eat human, economic,
and strategic value. It as been weakened by
divisions. The fact that Pakistan and our NATO
ally, Turkey, now plan to cooperate for security
gives both of these countries a new source of
strength. Also, they have set an example that
others may follow.
There are among our friends in the Middle East
and South Asia nations for which we propose
economic aid not related to direct military bene-
ﬁts. The people of these nations are engaged in
a stru gle in which the rimary need is not weap-
ons 0? war but the too 5 of peace. The largest
authorization sought in this category is for de-
velopment aid for India. On some issues India’s
foreign policy differs from our own. But India’s
rinciples—the rinciples of democracy—are bas-
ically those which we cherish. The people and
leaders of India are dedicated to the democratic
form of government. Their constitution is
modeled in part on our own with emphasis on
the Bill of Rights. India is making a great and
courageous effort to achieve the economic progress
necessary to foster democratic institutions of its
new independence.
This effort is in striking contrast to the develop-
ments in the nearby area of Communist Chinese
dictatorship. There is no doubt in my mind that
the people of Asia will be much inﬂuenced by their
comparison of the economic rogress made under
the democratic system of ndia and the Com-
munist dictatorship system in China. We believe
that India’s own great effort should be supported
so that its plan for economic development shall
succeed. We should remember that among free
nations there is room for diversity of views. We
should not let our wish to help the people of India
develop their nation be swayed by any temporary
differences, however important. It is essential
that we continue to help if for no other reason
than to serve our enlightened self-interest. It
would be a tragic day for us if the conﬁdence
which India’s peo 1e have in their democratic in-
stitutions should ail.
Latln Amerlea
I should like to say a word now about this hem-
isphere. The recent action of the Tenth Inter-
American Conference at Caracas marks an
imlportant step forward in unifying this hemi-
sp iere against the threat of international com-
mumsm.
There was then adopted a Declaration of
Solidarity for the Preservation of the Political
Integrity of the American States against Interna-
tional ommunist Intervention.a It was deter-
mined, with only Guatemala dissenting, that the
domination or control of the political institutions
of any American state by the international Com-
munist movement would constitute a threat to the
sovereignty and political independence of the
American states, endangering the peace of
America.
It is not, however, enough that the Communist
threat should be recognized for the danger that
it is. It is also necessary that steps be taken to
show solidarity on the economic front.
Livin standards in most of Latin America are
low an there are large and vocal elements who
seek to lace the blame on the United States.
Our utual Security Program recognizes the
importance of economic rowth and better stand-
ar 5 of living in Latin merica. Private enter-
prise is the main channel through which our Na-
tion can help. However, certain governmental
measures are also needed as a supplement. These
include the technical cooperation programs. The
Mutual Security Program for 1955 will provide
for this type of assistance in Latin America and
elsewhere. It produces results far greater than
can be measured by the dollars appropriated, for
it spreads knowledge that helps others to help
themselves.
Far East
In the Far East, the end of the ﬁghting in Korea
has its impact on the 1955 Mutual Security Pro-
gram.
It is no longer necessary for the Department of
Defense to expend the billions which were involved
in conducting active ﬁghting. In place of this
