quired to man these 9 stations. The 12 nations
which will either operate ships or make cash con-
tributions to the rogram are Canada, Denmark,
France, Ireland, IIlsrael, Ital , Netherlands, Nor-
way, Sweden, Switzerland,
United States.
The ConferenCe devised a new system of dis-
tribution of the responsibilities of maintaining the
stations, taking into consideration the develop-
ment of aeronautical techniques and the increased
number of transatlantic crossings since the res-
ent agreement was concluded in 1949. Two asic
elements were used in computing this distribu-
tion: aeronautical beneﬁts, based upon the number
of crossings made by aircraft of each articipat-
ing nation, and nonaeronautical bene ts, result-
ing mainly from the meteorolo ical observations
which are needed for weather orecasting in the
countries surroundin the North Atlantic. Other
nonaeronautical bene ts include the taking of ob-
servations useful to maritime interests, oceano-
aphic observations, and the guarding of radio
'stress frequencies for surface shipping. Aero-
nautical beneﬁts were considered to represent
80 percent of the value of the program, nonaero-
nautical beneﬁts 20 percent; as weather across the
North Atlantic moves eneral] from west to east,
the Conference consi ered t at the European
States would receive the larger proportion of non-
aeronautical beneﬁts and assessed them with 75
ercent of the value of this portion. The Con-
erence also authorized the Council of Icao to take
res nsibility for the coordination of the program
an its operation and to ﬁx cash contributions
after 2 years when the program is extended.
The stations and their locations are as follows:
Station A—62'00' N., 33‘00' W.-—Operated by Norway
and Sweden.
Station M—66'00' N., 02°00' E.—Operated by Netherlands.
Station K—45'00' N., 16°00' W.—0perated by France.
Station 1—61'00' N., 15°20' W.—Operatcd by United
Kingdom.
Station J—52’30' N., 20°00' W.—Operated by United
Kingdom.
Station B—56°30’ N., 51°00' W.-—Operated by United
States and Canada.
Station C—52°45' N., 35°30' W.—Operated by United
States.
Station D—44'00' N., 41°00’ W.—Operated by United
States.
Station H5'00‘ N., 48°00’ W.—Operated by United
States.
Station H—38‘40' N.. 69°35' W.—This station, operated
in the existing program, will not be maintained under
the new agreement
From January 1, 1955, for the 18-month period
until the new agreement expires, a rotation sys-
tem will be put into effect for the Euro an sta-
tions; then station M will be manned ships
from Norway and Sweden, and stations A, ,J and
K will be manned in rotation by the other uro-
pean nations which operate ocean-station vessels.
nited Kingdom, and
lnternatlonal Bank Makes
Loan to Turkey
The International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development on February 26 made a loan of $3.8
million to the Government of Turkey for port
development. The loan will supplement a loan of
$12.5 million made in July 1950 to ﬁnance the
foreign exchange costs of a series of ort improve-
ment and construction projects. he new loan
will cover an increase in the foreign exchange
r uirements of the projects.
‘he port projects being carried out with the
help of bank ﬁnancing are part of Turkey’s pro-
gram to modernize and enlarge its harbor facilities.
Most of Turkey’s foreign commerce and a lar a
part of its domestic trade are dependent on e -
cient seaports. Since the time of the bank’s ﬁrst
loan, the hysical volume of Turkey’s forei
trade has increased by about 90 percent and (E:
mestic trade has also increased greatly. Inade-
quate harbor facilities have resulted in overcrowd-
in and excessive port charges. The loans are
he pin to ﬁnance the improvements most urgently
neede to relieve the resent load on Turkeys
ports and to raise their immediate operational efﬁ-
ciency. The supplemental loan made today will
insure the foreign exchange necessary to bring the
pro'ects to completion.
he cost estimates of the projects have been
revised upward because (1) t e work which has
been carried on since 1950 indicated that certain
technical revisions in the original projects were
necessary; (2) there has been a general increase
in the costs of material and equipment since 1950;
and (3) requirements of the pr01ects for imported
construction equipment, steel, and cement are
larger than were ori inally anticipated. Conse-
quently, the estimate foreign exchange costs have
been increased from $12.5 million to $16.3 million.
The projects for which the bank’s loans are
being used include the construction of a new rt
at Samsun on the Black Sea; the expansion ofthe
ports of Salipazar and Ha darpasa on the Bos-
orus, Alsancak (the porto Izmir) on the Ae ean
ea, and Iskenderun on the Mediterranean ea;
and the installation of additional permanent
equipment at several smaller ports. Samsun has
no natural harbor, and the new port being built
there will give better access to a rich hinterland
in central and eastern Anatolia. Part of the im-
provements at Haydarpasa, Alsancak, and Isken-
derun will be designed to service new grain ele-
vators being built with the help of another bank
loan. The work at Salipazar, Haydarpasa, and
Iskenderun should be completed during 1955.
Completion of the construction at Samsun and
Alsancak is expected to take longer.
