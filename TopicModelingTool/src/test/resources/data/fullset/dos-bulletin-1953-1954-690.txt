said, “You Americans have lost Asia.” I made
the obvious retort that we Americans weren’t try-
ing to get Asia, that we did not regard Asia as a
mere pawn in the game of power politics; that we
regarded Asians as human beings, to be treated
with the respect to which human beings are en-
titled. After I made this statement, representa-
tives of countries in the Far East told me that it
would make a hit with their editors and olitical
leaders and that it should be translated into the
appropriate lan ages and sent out over the Voice
of America. T rat is the type of reaction which
cannot be obtained in any other way and which
you as newspapermen will appreciate.
The United Nations is a forum which can be
used to refute lies. Many of you remember, I am
sure, the dramatic presentation which was made
by Dr. Charles Mayo last fall, showing in detail
the falsity of Communist charges that United
States soldiers had used germ warfare in Korea.‘
Dr. Mayo’s resentation made the front page both
at home and) abroad over a ten-day period.
Chinese Communists Untlt tor U.N. Membership
The United Nations is a forum in which to
develop the truth, however dreadful it may be,
about the Soviet Union. We aired the reports in
the United Nations about the Soviet treatment of
Germans, Japanese, and Italian World War II
risoners.a When an impartial commission,
eaded by a distinguished Indian, made scientiﬁc
and objective ﬁndings about forced labor behind
the Iron Curtain, we used the world forum of the
United Nations as the place in which to bring them
before world opinion.‘
The United Nations is a lace to develop the
truth, however awful it may be, about the Chinese
Communists. We have consistently stressed that
the Chinese Communist regime is unﬁt for repre-
sentation in the United Nations
—because it has repeatedly expressed open con-
tempt for the pur oses and principles of the
United Nations, an the judgments of the inter-
national community;
—because it stands convicted b the United Na-
tions as an aggressor in Korea w ere it killed and
wounded many thousands of American and other
soldiers who were defending peace;
—because it continues to support aggression in
Indochina, by giving substantial aid and by fur-
nishing advisers and technicians to the Viet Minh
forces;
-—because it occupied defenseless Tibet and
seized control of its government and resources;
—because it sponsors guerrilla and subversive
movements in Malaya, and throughout the rest
of Southeast Asia;

—because it committed dreadful atrocities
against Americans and others ﬁghting for the
United Nations in Korea, and subjected prisoners
to hysical and mental cruelty in seeking to extort
mi itary secrets and confessions of alleged guilt;
—-because it still holds 32 American civﬂians
under barbarous conditions without published
charges, and subjects these innocent missionaries,
journalists, and businessmen to cruel and inhuman
treatment;
—because it wilfully fabricated and publicized
false evidence of spurious germ warfare charges
designed to blacken the reputation of the United
States, and otherwise carries on a deliberate “hate-
America” propaganda campaign;
-—because it has executed millions of its captive
subjects and forced other millions into slave labor;
—and because it even stoops to an international
extortion racket in squeezing millions of dollars
from overseas Chinese who try to buy safety and
protection for their relatives at home.
The ex osure of the terrible ways in which the
Chinese ommunists violate the normally accepted
standards of international conduct has so horriﬁed
many decent people that this regime has never
even otten a toehold on the threshold of the
Unite Nations. Since 1949, United Nations
bodies have refused over 150 times to seat the
Chinese Communists. I can promise you that the
United States will steadfastly resist all maneuvers
by the Chinese Communist re 'me and its advo-
cates to bribe its way into the nited Nations on
mere promises of ood behavior in the future. To
admit to the United Nations this regime which
believes in war as an instrument of national policy
would be the ﬁrst time in its history that the
United Nations had deliberately decided to stul-
tify itself by ﬂa antly acting in contradiction of
its primary and asic purpose to “save succeeding
generations from the scour e of war.”
The United Nations is a ace in which the world
initiative can be seized. e lost that initiative—
or rather we threw it away—at the end of hostili-
ties of World War II. On December 8 last ear,
President Eisenhower, speaking in the Unite Na-
tions, made his plea for an international stockpile
of ﬁssionable material to be used for peaceful pur-
poses.5 As James Reston, the diplomatic expert
of the New York Times, said, “The President put
the Kremlin more on the defensive than at any
time since the war.”
Most of us can remember a few short years back
when the Soviets held the indisputable initiative
in the cold war. Do you remember the so-called
“Stockholm Peace Appeal”—a fake petition device
of a kind which is familiar to every smalltOWn edi-
tor in this country but which deluded quite a few
of the gullible in other countries? Do you re-
member Picasso’s Communist peace pigeon!
