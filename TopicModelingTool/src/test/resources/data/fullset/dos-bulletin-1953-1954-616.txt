EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK
U.S./UN. preae release dated March 25
The U.S. delegation welcomes this opportunity
to discuss equal pay for equal work for men and
women. We regard equal pay—payment of the
rate for the job irrespective of the sex of the
worker—as fundamental to a sound economic sys-
tem. In my comment today I would like to do
two things:
First, to examine the current equal pay situa-
tion against the background of the Commission’s
work in this ﬁeld.
Second, to suggest a new and expanded approach
to increase the eﬁ'ectiveness of our work.
The Current Equal Pay Sltuatlon
We can take pride in the Commission’s record
in the ﬁeld of equal pay. E ual ay is a sub-
ject to which our Commission as evoted atten-
tion almost from the time of its establishment.
In fact, it mi ht be said that the Status of \Vonien
Commission rnished the impetus for the adop-
tion by the 11.0 [International Labor Organiza-
tion] of the Convention and Recommendation on
Equal Remuneration for WVork of Equal Value. I
refer to the resolution adopted by the Status of
Women Commission at its second session, in J an-
uary 1948, in which it invited the 11.0 and non-
governmental organizations to compile memoran-
a setting forth what action the were takin to
romote equal pay for men an women an so
implement the principle of the UN. Charter that
there shall be no discrimination based on sex.
At its third session in April 1949, in Lebanon,
the Commission rea rmed its interest and re-
quested the ILO to include the following points in
its study:
1. Adoption of the principle of the “rate for
the job” rather than of a rate based on sex;
2. Granting to women the same technical train-
ing and guidance, access to jobs, and promotion
procedures as those anted to men ;
3. Abolition of t e legal or customary restric,
tions on the pay of women workers; and
4. Provisions to lighten the tasks that arise from
women’s home responsibilities.
At our fourth session, in May 1950, the ILO
reported that it had sent a questionnaire to gov-
ernments on equal pay law and practice, and stated
that the ILO study was taking into account the
Commission’s suggestions, particularly the conce t
of wage rates based on job content rather than t e
worker’s sex.
U.S. SITUATION
The report on equal pay prepared by the Ino for
this session of the Comm1$sion shows the progress
which has been made through ofﬁcial action toward
gaining acceptance of the equal pay principle.
efore commenting on this report, however, I
would like to make a few brief statements on the
equal pay situation for women in the United
States.
The situation in the United States with respect
to equal pay is generally ood. We have ual
pay throughout the Federiﬁ Civil Service an in
the States where State civil service systems are in
effect. In private industry, management and
labor to an increasing extent are incorporating the
equal pay principle in collective-bargaining agree-
ments. Equal paﬂy laws for workers in private
industry are in e ect in approximately 14 of our
States. These States are t e big industrial States;
gproximately half of all employed women in the
nited States live in the 13 States that have equal
pay laws. Equal ay bills are pending in the
ederal Congress, 0th in the House and in the
Senate.
In the United States we are road of this prog-
gress. However, here as wellpas in many other
countries, there is still a big job to be done before
all women workers receive equal pay with men.
CURRENT ILO MIT
The ILO documentation for this session (Report
E/CN.6/23l) contains favorable information on
national action in connection with the Inc Conven~
tion and Recommendation. The United States
has carried out its responsibilities by bringing
this convention to the attention of the States for
appropriate action. The 11.0 Convention went
into force in May 1953 on ratiﬁcation by Belgium,
Mexico, and Yugoslavia. The report shows that,
since the last session, three additional countries
have ratiﬁed. i. e., France, the Dominican Repub-
lic, and Austria.
The report shows a constructive and judicious
attitude among the various governments toward
the equal pay principle. Several recommended a
stud of the standards and conditions which now
bloc the adoption of equal pay. In Finland,
such a study was recommended y the Parliament.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, the Govern-
ment proposed setting up a tripartite committee
to study the problem. In the Netherlands, a.
Council composed of representatives of labor and
industry as well as of government reported on the
problem. _
The ILO report states that Norway is looking
forward to puttin the equal pay principle into
effect in collective- ar aining agreements and that
Sweden expects to ta 'e action toward equalizing
men’s and women’s wages. Switzerland is study-
ing the effect of the equal pay system on its econ-
omy. In the United Kingdom, the London
County Council has adopted the principle of equal
pay for employees whose wages are negotiated
between the Council and its Staff Association.
