Future Steps
The re ort of the Commission on Foreign Eco-
nomic Po icy which I have sketched so brieﬂy out-
lines some (and I say some) of the problems with
which we are confronted. The question is—now
that we have the report—where do we go from
here? It is not easy to put the answer in a nut-
shell. Those of us who are on the ﬁring line in
the shaping of American foreign economic policy
have a sense of having passed a great landmark,
with the publication of this report. We have a
sense of having moved far since this Administra-
tion took ofﬁce a year ago. We all recall the in-
sistent public demands that have continued
throughout the past year, that one aspect or an-
other of the existin foreign economic policies of
the United States . ould be overhauled.
It would have been easy at the time, though in
the end it might have been disastrous, either to
junk the programs that then existed or to camou-
ﬂage them With a new loss. But President Eisen-
hower would do neit er. Des ite the insistent
pressure for immediate action, e sponsored the
eliberate and extensive review which the Randall
Commission undertook. The results of that re-
view, in my opinion, fully justify the President’s
decision.
The President has announced publicly that
Chairman Randall has d to return this com-
ing week to serve as a White House adviser. This
in itself is reassurin to those who have been so
anxiously awaiting this report. The ap ointment
of Mr. Randall is only the ﬁrst step. e Presi-
dent has indicated that the Administration will
submit recommendations to the Congress with re-
spect to the Randall Report. What the Congress
may choose to do with these recommendations, and
what it may choose to do on its own, I cannot pre-
dict. However. there is every reason to expect
that by the end of this congressional session the
whole ﬁeld of American economic forei policy
will have been canvassed and recanvasse , both in
the executive branch and in the Cong)ress. This
of course, means that the eneral pu lic too will
discuss these problems an bring its inﬂuence to
bear n n their solution. This is only another
wav o saying that the President, the Congress,
and the general public have now reached the point
where they are to make their decisions with respect
to the Randall Commission recommendations.
Amerlca's Economic Leadership
The Randall Commission and its report have
heightened my appreciation of the enormous sig-
niﬁcance of the economic leadership of the United
States in the free world. When I attended the
GA'rr meetings in Geneva last fall and when con-
sulting with leaders in Europe and in the Near
East, and when, prior to the isuance of the report,
in conversations with Ambassadors and re resen-
tatives of other countries in Washington, t 0 dis-
cussions inevitably turned to the Randall Report.
The tariff arrangements of the 34 countries in
GA'l‘l‘ were postponed for a year in anticipation of
the recommendations of the Randall Report. The
Trade Agreements Act was extended for 1 year
by our Congress pending the report of the Randall
Commission. Actions of governments, here and
abroad, have been conditioned by the expectation
that the Randall Commission would make pro-
nouncements affecting the actions referred to.
If anyone has ever doubted the fact, it is now
crystal clear that American leadership is not con-
ﬁned to resisting overt aggression abroad and
internal subversion at home. “'ithout belittlin 7
these for a moment, an equally important cha -
lenge is the economic leadership we exercise in the
world. Unless defense efforts and political sta-
bility are combined with economic stability, there
is no true security. Both our allies and ourselves
must build on a sound economic base if our way
of life is to prevail.
But in a broader sense, and even in a selﬁsth
national sense, we must build on a cooperative
basis. Our 160 million people, out of a world
population of 2% billion—800 million of which
ive under Soviet domination—make us realize
that strong and resourceful as we are, we can best
achieve security in cooperation and combination
with others. “'e do not have sufﬁcient resources
at our own command to meet the worldwide threat
of communism. It is precisely in this area where
the Randall Commission’s Report poses some of
its most fundamental meanings.
A strong economy, governed by enlightened
economic olicies, has its immediate bearin upon
strong an healthy defense arrangements a road,
whether these are with the Atlantic area or with
the lands of our southern neighbors, or with the
countries of the Paciﬁc Ocean. The free world
still must and does rely u n us. We are con-
stantly reminded that cyclical economic ﬂuctua-
tions of a minor character here in the United
States have a major impact abroad. And the eyes
of our partners in the free world are unswervingly
ﬁxed upon our economy in constant preoccupa-
tion with what will happen to them if our eco-
nomic situation changes even slightly.
That, my friends, is the signiﬁcance of enlight-
ened economic foreign policies of the United
States; that is the signiﬁcance of the Randall Be-
port and any actions that may be taken in pursuit
thereof. I am sure you will agree that we ﬁnd an
unusual res )onsibility thrust upon us. “'e must
help to so ve the problems of underdeveloped
countries. A failure to do so will aﬁect not only
our own relations with those countries, but also
our relations with other nations still uncommitted
in the struggle between the free and the slave
worlds.
It is my own conviction that a tremendous
challenge confronts the United States, its gOV-
ernment and people, at the present moment in
