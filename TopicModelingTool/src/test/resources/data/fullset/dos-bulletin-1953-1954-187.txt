Related Problems at Trade Adjustment
EAST-WT TIAOI
First, the present ban on exports by the United
States to Communist China and North Korea and
our efforts to secure similar action by others must
continue until the present threats to our security
and that of other free nations in those areas have
been removed
Secondly, our present efforts to prevent exports
to the European-Soviet bloc that might contribute
to its military strength must continue until gen-
uine peace is assure .
The Commission therefore recommends that, so
far as it can be done without jeopardizing military
security, and subject to the embargo on Communist
China and North Korea, the United States acqui-
esce in more trade in peaceful goods between
lVestern Europe and the Soviet bloc.
IIIONANT "ARIN! POLICY
The Commission recommends that the determi-
nation of the active merchant ﬂeet requirements of
the United States for the purposes of the Mer-
chant Marine Shipping Act of 1936 take account
of the availability of forei n vessels and of the
importance to the balance 0 payments of foreign
maritime nations of their dollar earnings from
shipping services. It recommends that such re-
guirements be determined by a high-level inter-
epartmental committee within the United States
Government, based upon these considerations as
well as those enumerated in the act.
The Commission recommends that the statutory
provisions requiring use of United States vessels
for shipments ﬁnanced by loans or grants of the
United States Government and its agencies be re-
pealed and that su port sufﬁcient to maintain a
merchant marine a equate to our national require-
ments be rovided by direct means, such as those
provided or under the Merchant Marine Shipping
Act of 1936.
TOURISM
The Commission recommends consideration of
means of facilitating the issuance of passports and
visas to tourists, and close cooperation with for-
eign governments through our missions abroad
to insure ease of entry and adequacy of accommo-
dation for travelers abroad. The duty-free allow-
ance for tourists which, in effect, now amounts to
$500 exercisable once every 6 months, should be
increased to $1,000. The President should direct
the appropriate departments of the Government to
encourage the promotion of tourism.
Currency Convertlblllty
The Commission believes that the decisions, the
methods, the time table, and the responsibility for
introducing currency convertibility should rest
on the countries concerned. It recognizes, how-
ever, that currency convertibility must be ex-
amined in the light of the policies pursued by
other countries, particularly the United States;
and it believes that the recommendations in the
preceding sections of this report, if carried out,
would encourage and assist foreign countries in
removing restrictions on trade and payments as
ra idly as prudence permits.
The Commission believes that convertible cur-
rencies constitute an indispensable condition for
the attainment of world-wide multilateral trade
and the maintenance of balanced trade in a rela-
tively free market. It would deplore a merely
formal convertibility maintained through trade
restrictions. It believes that the removal of re-
strictions u on (payment and upon trade should
go hand in lian . It favors gradual but positive
progress toward currency convertibilit .
the Commission’s view is t iat for the
purposes of a radual and controlled approach to
full convertibi it . . adequate reserves could
be found througli a much more active utilization
than heretofore of the International Monetary
Fund’s holdings of gold and convertible currencies
which now amount to $3.3 billion.
As a second means of strengthening foreign re-
serves and of providing foreign exchange support
operations to assist in the gradual attainment of
general convertibility, the Commission recom-
mends that the Federal Reserve System explore
with foreign central banks the possibilities of
standby credits or line of credit arrangements.
CONCLUSION
In closin this report and in submitting the fore-
oin conc usions and recommendations to the
reSident and the Congress, the Commission
wishes to stress the importance of consistency and
continuit with respect to our foreign economic
policy. ur position of leadership in the world
requires that we make clear to other countries the
principles upon which our policy is based, and
that t ereafter we seek to maintain stability in
our policy in order that the mutual conﬁdence so
urgently required in the ﬁeld of international
trade ma be advanced. This stability requires
hi h leve coordination of policy within the exec-
utive branch of the Government, and consistency
of action within the legislative branch.
