Modernlzlng the Atomic Energy Act
Message of the President to the Uongresa ‘
For the pu ose of stren hening the defense
and economy 0 the United tates and of the free
world, I recommend that the Congress approve a
number of amendments to the Atomic Energy Act
of 1946. These amendments would accomplish
this purpose, with proper security safeguards,
through the following means:
First, widened cooperation with our allies in
certain atomic ener y matters;
Second, improved procedures for the control
and dissemination of atomic energy information;
and
Third, encouragement of broadened participa-
tion in the development of peacetime uses of atomic
energy in the United States.
Nuclear Progress
In 1946, when the Atomic Energy Act was
written, the world was on the threshold of the
atomic era. A new and elemental source of tre-
mendous energy had been unlocked by the United
States the year before. To harness its power in
peaceful and productive service was even then our
ope and our goal, but its awesome destructive-
ness overshadowed its potential for good. In the
minds of most people this new energy was equated
with the atomic bomb, and the bomb spelled the
erasure of cities and the mass death of men,
women, and children.
Moreover, this Nation’s monopoly of atomic
weapons was of crucial importance in interna-
tional relations. The common defense and world
peace required that this monopoly be protected
and prolonged by the most stringent security safe-
ards.
In this atmosphere, the Atomic Energy Act
was written. Well suited to conditions then exist-
ing, the act in the main is still adequate to the
Nation’s needs.

Since 1946, however, there has been eat
progress in nuclear science and technology. en-
erations of normal scientiﬁc development have
been compressed into less than a decade. Each
successive year has seen technological advances in
atomic energy exceeding even progressive esti-
mates. The anticipations of 1946, when govern-
ment policy was established and the Atomic
Energy Act was written, have been far outdis-
tanced.
One popular assumption of 1946—that the
United States could maintain its monopoly in
atomic weapons for an a preciable time—was
quickly proved invalid. at monopoly disap-
earcd in 1949, only 3 years after the Atomic
nergy Act was enacted. But to counterbalance
that debit on the atomic ledger, there have been
mighty increases in our assets.
A wide variety of atomic weapons, considered
in 1946 to be mere possibilities of a distant future,
have toda achieved conventional status in the
arsenals 0 our armed forces. The thermonuclear
wea on, nonexistent 8 Iyears ago, today dwarfs
in estructive power a1 atomic weapons. The
practicability of constructing a submarine with
atomic propulsion was questionable in 1946; 3
weeks ago t e launching of the U. S. S. Nautilus
made it certain that the use of atomic energy for
ship (propulsion will ultimately become wide-
sprea . n 1946, too, economic industrial power
from atomic energy sources seemed very remote;
toda it is clearly in sight—largely a matter of
furt ier research and development and the estab-
lishment of conditions in which the spirit of enter-
prise can ﬂourish.
Obviously such developments as these within so
short a period should have had a profound in-
ﬂuence on the Nation’s atomic energy policy. But,
in a number of res cts, our atomic energy law
is still designed to t the conditions of 1946.
Many statutory restrictions, based on such
actual facts of 1946 as the American monopoly of
