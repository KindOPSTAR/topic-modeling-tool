the neighboring experiment being conducted in
China by the Communist police state system. We
believe that it is important to the United States
that India’s 5-year economic plan should succeed,
and that to continue to help in this is legitimately
in the enlightened self-interest of the United
States.
It can, however, be reported that, generally
speaking, measures of a self-reliant nature are
effectively replacing grant aid.
The Middle East
Another new element of encouragement is the
action of Turkey and Pakistan in concluding, last
week, a treaty of friendship and cooperation. It
is good that the concept of mutual security has
taken hold in the important Middle East. This is
an area of great human, economic, and strategic
value. It has been weakened by divisions. The
fact that Pakistan and our NATO ally, Turkey, now
plan to cooperate for security gives both of these
countries a new source of strength. Also, they
have set an example that others may follow.
The 1955 mutual securit program will include
continuing authorization or military supplies to
Pakistan, designed to enable it to play its part in
regional defense. It may be noted that Pakistan
has given clear assurance that the military aid it
receives from the United States will be used only
for defensive purposes.
thln Amerlca
Before discussing the Far East, I should like
to say a word about this hemisphere. I returned
only recently from the Tenth Inter-American Con-
ference at Caracas. That Conference made a ma-
jor declaration of foreign policy. It afﬁrmed that,
if the international Communist movement came to
dominate or control the political institutions of
any American state, that would constitute a threat
to the sovereignty and political independence of all
the American states, endangering the peace of
America.2 The only vote against that declara-
tion came from Guatemala, for reasons that are
obvious.
This action taken by the Inter-American Con-
ference marks an important ste forward in uni-
fying this hemisphere against t e threat of inter-
national communism. However, other steps also
are needed. Living standards in most of Latin
America are low, and there are large and vocal ele-
ments who seek to place the blame on the United
States.
Our mutual security rogram will take into ac-
count the importance 0 economic growth and bet-
ter standards of living in Latin America. The
principal help our Nation can give will be through
private enterprise. However, this can and shou d

be supplemented by certain governmental meas-
ures. Among these are the technical cooperation
programs. The mutual security program for 1955
will contain some continuing provxsion for this
type of assistance in Latin America and elsewhere.
It produces results far greater than can be meas-
ured by the dollars appropriated, for it s )reads
knowledge that helps others to help themselves.
Now let me turn to the Far East. There the de-
velopments of the year have produced mixed re-
sults, some favorable and some unfavorable. In
Korea the ﬁghting has been ended by an armistice
concluded last J uly. The killing there has
stopped. That resu t, honorably achieved, has,
we elieve, aﬂ‘orded deep satisfaction to the Amer-
ican people.
The ending of the ﬁghting has its impact on the
1955 mutual security program.
It is no longer necessarg7 for the Department of
Defense to ex end the illions which were in-
volved in con ucting active ﬁghting. In place
of this destructive and wasteful expenditure, there
is now a program for relief and rehabilitation of
the Republic of Korea. This in part is being con-
ducted by the United Nations, but the main part
is a United States effort.
It is an immense task to restore domestic well-
being in war-ravaged Korea. However, the cost
represents only a small fraction of what would
be the cost of waging war. \Ve believe that the
accomplishment of this peaceful task will be in
the interest of the United States and of the free
world if it shows, as we know it can, the capacity
of free men to excel in the arts of peace.
Japan
The Government of Japan is now planning to
assume a larger share of responsibility for its own
defense, which will contribute to the maintenance
of peace and security in the Far East. The J ap-
anese have been understandably reluctant to as-
sume the economic burden of recreating even a
modest security establishment. Also, they were
so shocked by the ghastly consequences of World
War II that they have tended to close their eyes
to the emergence of a new military threat. How-
ever, on March 8, 1954, a mutual security agree-
ment was signed between the United States and
Japan.3 It contemplates an expansion of the J ap-
anese defense forces with United States assistance
principally in terms of military end-items.
\Vhile this will create an item of cost for the United
States, it is a cost which will have compensating
beneﬁts.
