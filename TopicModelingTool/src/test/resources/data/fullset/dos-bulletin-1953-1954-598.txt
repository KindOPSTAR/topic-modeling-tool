and continuous threat to the security of our own
country. The day when we could look at a few
large countries and say “these—and what happens
there—are important to us” is unfortunate] gone.
Toda one can scarcely think of an area an say it
is sa e and secure and we need not concern our-
selves. Least of all can we say that about the
Middle East.
Importance of Area to U.S.
I say least of all the Middle East for many
reasons. First of all—and this must always come
ﬁrst—are the people of the Middle East itself,
some 65 million souls, whose welfare concerns us
and whose views and policies are inﬂuential
throughout the whole Asian-African belt of
restive people. Secondl there is the stratevic
position of the Middle East from a geo ap ic
viewpoint. History is amply tabled With the
names of con uerors and would-be conquerors who
have used this crossroads of three continents in
their search for empires. Every ma'or interna-
tional airline connecting Asia with urope and
the United States passes through the Middle East.
The Suez Canal is a vital artery of world shipping,
offering an easy route to South Asia, With its
tremendous sources of manpower and raw mate-
rials, and to the continent of Africa, with its de-
posits of uranium, manganese, chrome and copper.
General Eisenhower has said, “As far as sheer
value of territory is concerned, there is no more
strategically important area in the world.” And
thirdly, one must think of the resources of the
area. \Vithout the oil of the Middle East the
industries of our allies would be paral zed and
our own would be overworked. It is 0 vast im-
ortance that such resources not come into the
ands of enemies of the non-Communist world.
Out of these three points come the objectives of
American policy in the Middle East. In them-
selves these appear as simple matters: ( 1) the ro-
motion of peace in the area amon the Mi dle
Eastern states themselves as well as etter under-
standing between them and the \Vestern Powers;
(2) a desire to see governmental stability and the
maintenance of law and order; (3) the creation of
conditions which would brin about a rise in the
general economic welfare; 4) the preservation
and strengthening of democrac ’s growth—not
necessarily in our own pattern, ut at least in a
form which reco izes the same basic principles
as the democracy in which we believe; and (5) the
encouragement of regional defense measures
against aggression from outside the area.
Yet the troubles and undercurrents which exist
today in the Middle East make it exceedingly diﬂi-
cult for us to reach our objectives. Many of the
nations in this area are newly independent and
therefore extremely jealous of their national sov-
ereignty. After years of occupation, or foreign
entanglements of various sorts, they are suspicious
of all foreign inﬂuence. In some cases, the doc-
trine of nationalism has assumed extreme forms.
Some of these states are fearful. In certain
areas the fear of one’s neighbor exceeds that from
any other direction. It is a surprise to man
Americans that Soviet encroachment and im eri-
alism is not reco ized in arts of the Middle ast
as the primary an er. ome of the Middle East
see an enemy muc closer at hand. They turn
their thoughts and actions not toward the secu-
rity of the whole re ion but to security of one
against the other, an they thus present a picture
0 disunit of purpose which can be and is being
exploited by the agents of the Soviet Union.
And then there is fear even of one’s own kind.
Many Middle Easterners look upon their govern-
ments as cold and selﬁsh bodies little interested
in the welfare of the people under it. Therefore,
whom to trust? Whom to believe in? \Vhom to
work for? The result has been a pattern of po-
litical instability.
Finally, the difﬁculties are made even greater
by the economic poverty and inequalities in the
region. These countries which have no mineral
wealth such as oil face tremendous problems in
an effort to improve their well—bein . ‘Vithout
ai of other countries it is impossib e for some
of them to even start the necessary development
of their country.
In an effort to assist constructively in the solu-
tion of the basic causes of instability in the area
one ﬁnds that the political base upon which to
work does not today exist. The all-absorbing
attention of governments and people is at present
focused to too great an extent upon disputes which
lie within the area or between states of the area
and outside owers. The list of these disputes is
appalling. he An lo-Egy tian dispute over the
Suez Canal base an in the udan, the great com-
lex of Arab-Israeli problems, the dispute over
undaries in the Trucial coast area between Saudi
Arabia and the United Kingdom, the Anglo-
Iranian oil dispute. To this could be added many
lesser grievances. One must, to complete the pic-
ture, add on one side the situation in North
Africa between the French and the local popula-
tions in Morocco and Tunisia and on the other the
difﬁculties between India and 1Pakistan, symbolized
by the Kashmir uestion, because these, while out-
side the Middle ast itself, have a bearing upon
the stability of the area as a whole.
In each of these problems the United States is
involved—involved either because our inﬂuence is
sou ht or because we must take a position in the
United Nations or between two friends, or because
we feel a mutually satisfactory solution is so
important to the security of the area and hence to
ourselves that we must take an active interest.
