ceived by the Spanish Government and by the
businessmen they met in Spain, both in Madrid
and here in Barcelona. This trade mission left
no doubt about the importance the United States
attaches to the need for the United States to in-
crease its imports as well as its exports. This em-
phasis on their part is in complete harmony with
resident Eisenhower’s message to Congress on
this subject delivered on March 30,‘ in which he
not only stated that it was in the national interest
to obtain the highest level of trade as well as the
most efﬁcient use of capital and resources, but rec-
ommended to the Congress that it enact legislation
which would renew the Trade Agreements Act and
allow for further reduction of tariffs ursuant to
negotiations; that customs simpliﬁcation le isla-
tion be enacted; that the present “Buy American”
laws be modiﬁed; and that other steps be taken to
make it easier for the United States to import.
Moreover, the President just last week, in his proc-
lamation of World Trade Week, declared that “the
growth and prosperity of the nations of the free
world depend to a signiﬁcant degree upon the con-
tinued expansion of the exchange of their goods
and services in world markets.” ‘
Exchange Program
A most useful byproduct of the new relation-
ship between Spain and the United States is the
exchange of visits by leaders in the ﬁelds of both
commerce and defense. Recently the Minister of
Commerce, Don Manuel Arburua, that very able
and distinguished gentleman who is with us here
tonight and who has had a long and fruitful as-
sociation with this Chamber, made a most suc-
cessful visit to Washington as well as a tour of
business and industrial centers throughout the
United States. I am sure that the associations he
formed there will contribute substantially toward
the development of trade prospects for both Spain
and the United States.
Likewise, the Minister of Air, General Gonzalez
Gallarza, has just had a most useful ofﬁcial visit
which included conversations with his American
military colleagues as well as an inspection of
important American military sites.
We look forward this fall to the visit of the
Minister of Agriculture, Don Rafael Cavestany,
in connection with our important mutual interest
in the ﬁeld of agriculture. Just as it has been
most helpful for prominent Americans to come
here and learn at ﬁrst hand about Spain, so is it to
our mutual advantage that distinguished Spanish
leaders should exchange views at ﬁrst hand in
Washington and become closely acquainted with
the United States.

With regard to the military agreements, I am
lad to report that we are making steady progress.
Fquipment for the Spanish Armed Forces—army,
Inavy, and air—continues to arrive and. as the
program develops, should substantial] increase
the defense effectiveness of Spain. ‘arly this
month, the people of Barcelona saw some of the
latest type of jet training lanes unloaded in the
port en route to Talaveral a Real. The program
for the construction of military facilities is also
gaining momentum. It is expected that the time-
consuming planning and design stage will be sufﬁ-
ciently far advanced by this summer to permit the
actual construction of certain of the projects to be
started in early autumn. The managing con-
tractor ﬁrm which was selected late in January
has made its preliminary engineering, equipment,
and organization studies, and its representatives
have been in Washington recently to consult with
the Department of Defense. The ﬁrst construc-
tion Wlll be at Zaragoza and Torrejon by mid-
summer. As you know, the maximum practical
use will be made of the Spanish construction in-
dustry as well as Spanish labor, always with due
regard for the necessities of the Spanish economy.
In closing this progress report which I have
been privileged to make to you tonight, I wish to
emphasize, and to ask you to take with you, a
conception of the long distance we have traveled
along the path of the new Spanish-American rela-
tionship established since I spoke with you last
year here in Barcelona. Viewed day by day, we
often tend not to realize the advance we have
made. The understanding between Spain and the
United States is no ﬂy-by-night or hastily con-
ceived policy. It is a partnership carefully con-
sidered and entered into in full faith by two
sovereign peoples, each with high respect for the
other and a conﬁdent knowledge that both fully
comprehend the nature and intent of the foreign
aggression which menaces the free world. In
carrying out the agreements reached last year, we
have already established a spirit of cooperation
that augurs well for the future. By increasing
our military and economic strength, we not only
contribute to our own security but also to that of
the Western World and to the attainment of
world peace.
Shipment of Seed to Iraq
The Foreign Operations Administration an-
nounced on May 26 that an emergency shipment of
6 tons of garden seed would be sent to Iraq by air
on May 27. The seed represents the ﬁrst install-
ment of a 25-ton shipment to help the farmers of
Iraq, whose spring plantings were washed away
by ﬂoods in March and April. The initial ship-
