by the Brazilian and Colombian delegations the
declaration contained in its draft could usefully
be amended by insertin before the words “appro-
priate action’ the wor s “for consultation and,”
so as to make it erfectly clear that meetings of
consultation wou d recede action—as is indeed
prescribed both by t e Rio Pact and by the char-
ter of the American States.
4. The Mexican delegation has proposed cer-
tain amendments to the second section of the U.S.
draft which contains recommendations which re-
late primaril to exposures and exchanges of in-
formation. or reasons which were very ably
expressed b the chairman of the Haitian dele-
gation, the United States believes that the Mexi-
can amendments in this respect are inadvisable.
References to Social and Economic Measures
A considerable amount of discussion has related
to the possible inclusion in the proposed declara-
tion of references to social and economic measures
which it is believed would help our American Re-
publics in their ﬁght against international com-
munism. In this connection an amendment has
been proposed by the Mexican dele ate and a sug-
gestion made b the Panamanian delegation.
The U.S. de egation believes that this Confer-
ence should make clear in no uncertain terms the
dedication of our Republics to human rights and
freedoms and to healthy economic and social con-
ditions. In a statement which I made yesterday
before the Economic Committee, I pledged my
Government to support economic proposals in this
sense, and we will equally support an appropriate
declaration dealin with human rights and with
the inherent dignity of the indiwdual without
regard to race, nationality, religion, or class. We
entertain grave doubt, however, as to the wisdom
of including such a declaration in our message of
warning to the Communist dictators. There are
two reasons for our 0 inion that our declaration
in these respects shou d be made elsewhere.
In the ﬁrst place, it is, we believe, unfortunate
to give the impression that we are interested in
human rights, individual dignity, and opportunity
and economic welfare only because we thereby
combat communism. If there were no Commu-
nist threat in the world today, we would still
believe that this Conference should renew its dedi-
cation to human welfare and its enhancement. It
seems to us to degrade that which is most sacred
and fundamental, to treat it as merely an anti-
Communist tactic.
In the second place, it seems inappropriate to
include a reference to our economic and social
needs in a warning addressed to alien dictators.
Surely we do not want to say to them in effect that
their intervention would be acceptable in the case
of an American State which did not achieve an
ideal political, social, or economic order. The
United States believes that the principle of non-
intervention is an absolute rinci lo and that we
should avoid anything whic coul be interpreted
to indicate that we would compromise it under
any conditions.
or both reasons the United States believes that
the declarations of our dedication to, and concern
for, social and economic welfare should be ex-
ressed in another resolution rather than in a
eclaration of foreign policy directed to the alien
despots who plot against us.
Mr. Chairman and Fellow Delegates, there are
one or two around this table who seem to have
expressed the thought that our collective Amer-
ican system is incapable of dealing with the kind
of threat which now faces us and the formidable
character of which has been demonstrated in re-
spect to man countries and many people.
It is said t at we cannot show a collective front
against this danger because we cannot trust our-
selves. It is suggested that the doctrine of non-
intervention is so lightly regarded by the Amer
ican States themselves that two-thirds of them
mi ht unite to practice intervention against a
fel ow American State. This danger is said to
be so much greater than the danger of Commu-
nist intervention, that the American States should
leave themselves exposed to international com-
munism rather than run the risk that the doctrine
of collective security might be turned by Ameri-
can States themselves into a doctrine of collective
intervention.
Mr. Chairman, I have greater faith than that
in the American system. I believe that there is
not a single American State which would rac-
tice intervention against another American tate.
It is incredible to me that it should even be su -
sted that 14 of our 21 American States could
ound to abuse the charter of the American
States and the Rio Pact and to pervert those great
enlightened political instruments into instru-
ments of evil.
I can think of nothing more disastrous than for
such mutual distrust to be exhibited to all the
world so that our enemies may seek to take advan-
ta e from it.
believe that the great disasters come about
largely through miscalculation. Aggressors as-
sume that they can with little risk make great
gains. The purpose of the declaration proposed
y the United States is to give a warning which
will prevent such miscalculation. We believe that
if the American Republics clearly and unitedly
warn the alien plotters to kee away, the effect of
that warning will be greatly to diminish the
danger.
We believe, on the other hand, that if we fail to
utter that clear and united warning, if we show
distrust among ourselves, then the danger will go
on mounting, and presently our beloved America
will be ravaged by those evil forces which have
turned Europe and Asia. into continents of strife
and misery.
