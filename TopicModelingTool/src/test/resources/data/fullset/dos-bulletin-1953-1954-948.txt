Of the 165,165 persons moved by the Committee
between February 1‘, 1952, and December 31, 1953,
47,000 were refugees under the mandate of the
Ofﬁce of the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees.
On recommendation by the Ad Hoc Subcom~
mittee on Draft Rules and Regulations the Com-
mittee a proved the texts of rules of rocedure
for the ouncil and for the Executive Cldmmittee.
After the constitution comes into force, these rules
of procedure will be referred to the Council and
to the Executive Committee for adoption. Draft
staff and ﬁnancial regulations were referred to a
later session of the Committee.
Acting on the report of the Subcommittee on
Finance, com osed of Australia, Canada, France
Germany, Ita , the Netherlands, and the United
States, the Committee acce ted the ﬁnancial re-
port for 1953, which showe income of $2,525,490
to cover administrative expenditure and income of
$30,886,080 for operational expenditure, a total
of $33,411,570. Administrative expenditure
totaled $1,970,302 and operational expenditure
$23,885,114, totaling $25,855,416.
Revised Budget for 1954
The Subcommittee on Finance recommended
and the Mi ation Committee adopted a revised
budget and: plan of expenditure for 1954
envisaging the movement of 118,400 persons.
Administrative expenditure of $2,580,437 and
operational expenditure of $37,413,636 were ap-
roved, making the total budget adopted for 1954
9,994,073.
The adoption of this budget presented the Com-
mittee with a challenge to raise $2,588,109 in ad-
ditional resources to cover an anticipated deﬁcit
in that amount in the 1954 operations. The Com-
mittee was convinced that the anticipated deﬁcit
would develop in fact because the movement of
persons in the ﬁrst 4 months of 1954 totaled
40,328 and there was thus every indication that
the estimate of 118,400 in movement would be
achieved in 1954. In response to this situation the
Australian representative reported an offer of an
additional contribution of $400 thousand for 1954.
Denmark offered an additional $30 thousand and
Norway $14 thousand. The United States re
resentative, W. Hallam Tuck, offered on beh f
of the United States an additional contribution
totalin $1 million: $500 thousand to be made
availab e on the basis of movement achieved in
excess of 110,000 up to a maximum of 118,400, and
$500 thousand in consideration of comparable
contributions by other member governments to
cover the anticipated deﬁcit.
In offering this special contribution, the United
States representative stressed again the need for
additional contributions by member governments
to the operational expenditure and expressed the
hope that the additional contributions offered at
the seventh session would inspire other member
gpvernments to make comparable contributions.
e also stressed the necessity for placing a larger
proportion of the movement achieved on a re-
volving-fund basis and urged that more of the
migrants be encouraged to contribute under par-
tiaI payment plans toward the costs of their
transport.
The Migration Committee recognized the close
relationshlp between the anticipated deﬁcit in in-
come for 1954 and the need for the Committee
to establish the cash reserve proposed by the Di-
rector. The Director pointed out that such a
cash reserve would be needed in the fall months
of 1954, if the Committee were to be in a position
to ﬁnance its operations in 1955 and to make the
advance payments recppired. The Director urged
all governments to ma e pa ents on administra-
tive and operational contri utions earlier and in
any event to make reimbursements for movements
effected by the Committee immediately on pres-
entation of invoices.
The Director originally proposed the establish-
ment of a cash reserve of $3 million: $1 million to
be allocated as a reserve for administrative ex-
penditure and $2 million for operational expendi-
ture. Contributions were to be made to the reserve
for administrative expenditure by all member gov-
ernments in accordance with the scale of contribu-
tions to the administrative expenditure already in
effect. However, the Director proposed that only
the emigration and immigration countries contrib-
ute to the cash reserve for operational ex enditure.
The United States re resentative vised the
Committee that the nited States would give
serious consideration to the request for a one-time
contribution to a cash reserve on a loan basis in
addition to the regular contribution, provided all
member governments were asked to contribute
approximately on the scale of contributions to
administrative expenditure to the total of the pro-
posed $3 million cash reserve. This proposal met
with some resistance from the so-called sympa-
thizing government members and the adminis-
tration on the ground that the sympathizing
governments were not prepared to share in the
costs of operations. After discussion the United
States view prevailed and was embodied in the
996
