and the paciﬁc settlement of disputes. The re-
gional organization, born 60 years ago, has become
a strong and permanent institution. And we are
keenly aware of the moral and political inﬂuence
of Latin America in the United Nations, where
20 countries have one-third of the votes. But we
do not hear so much of the widespread activities
of these or anizations in he] ing the member
countries to evelop and strengthen their economic
and social life.
For example, the Organization of American
States has at Bogota a center for studying and
training in housing development; in Caracas it
is just opening a center for training normal-school
teachers; and at Montevideo, it has a center for
child-welfare studies and training. There are 13
special inter-American agencies now connected
with the Organization of American States (and
I might mention that a splendid example of econ-
omy and efﬁciency has been given by sifting this
number out of 28 that existed a few years ago).
In the realm of technical assistance, the Pan
American Sanitary Organization is the most
widely known for its many contributions to the
health of the hemisphere. This agency, now
afﬁliated with the World Health Organization,
has likewise made tremendous strides in conquer-
ing the scourge of such diseases as malaria, yaws,
and tuberculosis. In talking about technical as-
sistance and health, I must likewise mention the
great impulse given to health and sanitation in
the American Republics by the privately endowed
Rockefeller Foundation.
The United Nations has some 370 technical ex-
perts in 19 countries of Latin America, in almost
every major ﬁeld of economic activity—from
geological surveys to ﬁsheries development—from
civil aviation to public ﬁnance. Also, under this
program, 650 persons last year were given fellow-
ships for technical trainin . One of the interest-
ing features of United Nations technical assistance
is the variety of nationality of the technical ex-
perts and the fact that 18 of the 19 Latin Ameri-
can countries that receive assistance also loan the
services of ex erts to other countries. Each coun-
try has special industries in which its people
excel. An expert from Haiti is, for example
teaching the Abyssinians how to package an '
merchandise coﬂ'ee. This expert, incidentally, has
found 12 new varieties of coffee to take back to
Latin America.
Modest Cost of U. 5. Measures
All of these measures of governmental assist-
ance are helpin‘ to build economic and social
health and to stlmulate private enterprise. The
cost to the United States taxpayer is modest. The
annual expenditures of our overnment in all
forms of relations with Latin America are less
than one-third of the amount of new investment in
Latin America each year by our citizens. These
expenditures are about V100 of the value of our
trade with Latin America. They are about 1/1000
of the Federal tax dollar. With this amount,
Government is doing work that I believe is not
only of great use but even indispensable. But
the contrasts I have mentioned point up the extent
to which we must depend upon what the private
citizen is doing.
There are many important relations with Latin
America that I have not even mentioned. I have
not mentioned the dee spiritual bond of religion;
nor the artistic and on tural exchan e from which
we have much to gain. I have only arely touched
upon mutual concern about the insidious anti-
religious efforts of communism. Nor have I dis-
cussed cooperation for military defense. But I
hope I have succeeded in portrayin somethi
of the scope and growth In our re ations witi
Latin America and something of the possibilities
for the future.
The challenge and opportunity of progress are
signiﬁcant in themselves. But Secretary Dulles
summed u the total objective very simply when
he said, “ ever in all our history was there a time
when 00d friends and allies meant so much to
us. T mm is need, as never before, of cooperation
between free nations.”
Use of Agricultural Surpluses
In Overseas Programs
Statement by Samuel 0. Waugh
Assistant Secretary for E commie A [fairs 1
I want brieﬂ to state the principles and objec-
tives that shou d govern our efforts effectively to
utilize agricultural surpluses in overseas pro-
grams.
Coordination: We are in complete agreement
with Senator Case that for the most successful
results the Government’s activities in the disposal
abroad of surplus agricultural commodities must
be carried out on a coordinated basis. Unco-
ordinated and independent activities in this ﬁeld
can easily lead to confusion and inefﬁciencies.
To the greatest extent feasible it would appear
that the administration of disposal programs
should be centralized. The various executive
agencies are giving careful stud to this problem
in connection with the Presi ent’s proposal—
mentioned in the Budget Message 2—to set aside
and use $1 billion worth of Commodity Credit
Corporation stocks for disposal in friendly for-
eign countries during the next 3 years.
Objectives: The objectives of the proposed $1
billion program are:
‘Made before the Subcommittee on Real Estate and
Military Construction of the Senate Armed Services Com-
mittee on Jan. 27 (press release 37).
