the statement: “That we shall continue our efforts
to seek a settlement of the German roblem,” and
that, of course, the United States is isposed to do.
Then the paper in its paragra h 2 goes on to
repeat the pzoposal which has eretofore been
made a num r of times by the Soviet Union with
reference to the withdrawal of so-called occupa-
tion forces from East and West Germany.
There is one translating uestion which I would
like to raise. In paragrap 2 (B) there is a ref-
erence to putting the occupation forces back in
case security in Germany is threatened. The
English text reads: “. . . in case the security of
either part of Germany is threatened . . .” and
I understand the Russian text reads “. . . In case
the security in either part of Germany is threat-
ened. . . .” In other words, I interpret that par-
agraph 2 (B) to relate to internal security, but I
would be happy to have conﬁrmation of that point
from the Sowet delegation.
Mr. Mow'rov: I would ask you to be guided by
the Russian text.
Mr. DULm-zs: That conﬁrms my view, then, that
the pro osal with reference to Germany is sub-
stantial y the same as heretofore submitted by the
Soviet delegation.
It makes it relevant, therefore, only for me to
repeat what has been said before by me and others
around this table: That the proposal would leave
West Germany and consequently much of WVestern
Europe exposed to any threat of external
aggression.
A third paragraph of this paper contemplates
the calling of another conference, and it is per-
haps in order for me in this connection to say
what I have said before; namel , that it seems
whenever we have a conference w ich is unable to
settle anythin , the Soviet Union proposes that
we have anot er conference, and a conference
which can only breed other conferences is the best
we can do. That is a rather disheartening
conclusion.
Draft lmplles Replacement of NATO
The second paper is the text of a proposed gen-
eral European treaty on collective security in
Europe. Since the United States would pre-
suma ly not be a part of that treaty, my observa-
tions are not directed primarily to the actual text
of the treaty, although there are certain implica-
tions in it which do affect the United States. It
is perhaps implicit in the draft, although not en-
tirely clear, that it is designed to replace the
North Atlantic Treaty. I assume that from the
provisions of articles 7 and perhaps 10, and the
fact that the Soviet Foreign Minister in intro-
ducing his text, made a serious attack upon the
North Atlantic Pact “as resembling in many ways
the anti-Comintern Pact which led to the unleash-
ing of the Second World \Var.” He went on to
say that “there are no reasons to doubt that the
fate of the North Atlantic Pact shall be any better
than that of the anti-Comintern Pact.”
So, I presume, although the Soviet Foreign
Minister can correct me if I am wrong, that his
proposed treaty for Euro ean collective securit
would be in reality a rep acement of the Nort
Atlantic Treat .
The United States certainly cannot take offense
at the su gestion of the Sowet Foreign Minister
that the uropean countries should get together
for their own collective security without the par-
ticipation of the United States. The United
States, I think, has never intruded itself as an
unwanted artlcipant in European affairs, and
we do not ave any intentions of doing so in the
future.
The American peo 1e have a very deep and
legitimate interest in urope. Most of us derive
from Western Europe. We share the culture and
traditions and reli ion of Western Europe, and
there are many bon s which tie us very closely to-
gether. But we do not feel that on that account
we have an right to demand participation in
European a airs.
The United States sent its armed forces to
Euro e in the First World War when the West
was t reatened by German militarism under the
Kaiser. We delayed somewhat in doin so. But
at the urgent appeal and desire of the t ireatened
peoples of Western Euro e, and because our own
interests became involve , we did participate and
certainly contributed to the ﬁnal defeat of the
German militarists represented by the Kaiser.
When that war was over, we took our troops
home at once. Then the same story was repeated
under Hitler in the Second World War, and again,
after some delay and when the danger not only
to Western Euro e but also the Soviet Union was
immense, and Wien we ourselves seemed threat-
ened, we made a gigantic effort of putting troops
and su plies in ‘ urope to he] to save Europe
from t e renewed militarism 0? Germany.
And, after the Second World War we with-
drew all our forces from Europe, except a rela-
tively small number who were required for 0c-
cu ation purposes in Germany.
ow, for the third time in this century, we have
sent forces back to Europe and again the reason
was that there were many in Euro e who were
afraid and who asked us to do so. ll‘hat fear is,
I imagine, a fear which cannot be allayed by new
words and new promises, because the fear was in-
spired by a country which was already bound by
the United Nations Charter not to use force against
the territorial integrity or independence of any
state. Whether that fear will be allayed by any
repetition of that pledge is not for me to decide.
Divlslon of Europe
It has been suggested that our participation in
the present defense of West Europe to which I now
