their intention to maintain Communist control
over North Korea. They have persisted in the
same attitudes which have frustrated United Na-
tions efforts to unify Korea since 1947.
We believe, therefore, that it is better to face the
fact of our disagreement than to raise false hopes
and mislead the peoples of the world into believmg
that there is agreement where there is none.
In the circumstances, we have been compelled
reluctantly and regretfully to conclude that so
long as the Communist delegations reject the two
fundamental rinciples which we consider indis-
pensable, furt er consideration and examination
of the Korean question by the conference would
serve no useful purpose. We reafﬁrm our con-
tinued sup ort for the objectives of the United
Nations in orea.
In accordance with the resolution of the General
Assembly of the United Nations of August 28,
1953, the member states arties to this declaration
will inform the Unite Nations concerning the
proceedings at this conference.
Thailand’s Request for
Peace Observation Mlsslon
Followz'n are the texts of (I) a statement by
Secretary ulles on. the Soviet 'veto of the Thai
proposal, (2) a statement made before the Se-
cu/rity Council by Ambassador Henry Cabot
Lodge, Jr., U .S. representative to the United Na-
tions, on the proposal, and (3) the Thai draft
resolution:
STATEMENT BY SECRETARY DULLES, JUNE 18
Press release 331 dated June 18
It is deeply to be regretted that the Soviet Union
should have cast its 59th veto in the Security
Council today to prevent Thailand from having a
United Nations peace observation mission. A
peace observation mission has no authority to take
decisions. It is merely the eyes and ears of the
United Nations through which it and the whole
world can know the facts as to what is going on
in an area of tension. This denial to a small and
peaceful nation—and one of the members of the
United Nations—0f the right to get even this
minimum protection is one more example of the
emptiness of the Soviet professions of peaceful
purpose. The veto conﬁrms our fear that it is the
Communist forces which want to shroud in dark-
ness their deeds in this area.
STATEMENT BY AMBASSADOR LODGE, JUNE 16
U.S./U.N. press release 1921 dated June 16
Let me present the views of the United States
Government with regard to the request of the
Government of Thailand that a subcommission of
the Peace Observation Commission be sent to its
territory.
It is the view of the United States that it would
be prudent and highly desirable to authorize the
Peace Observation Commission to observe devel-
opments in the area of Thailand in order to pro-
vide the United Nations with independent reports
on the dan er to international peace and security
caused by the conﬂict in Indochina.
In his lucid statement made at our last meeting,
the distin ished representative of Thailand has
establishe beyond any doubt or argument that
the tension in the area of Thailand resents a
serious threat to the peace and security of his
country. The ﬁerce struggle in the jungles and
deltas of Indochina may seem remote and distant.
But the danger it presents to Thailand and the
rest of Southeast Asia is close and immediate—
and in all truth the world has own so small that
no place is any longer really “ ar away” from any
other.
In the interest of speed and to avoid making
unnecessa statements, I shall not take the time
to review t e origin and esent status of the con-
ﬂict in Indochina. The acts are so clear that no
amount of propaganda can conceal this latest
attempt of Communist imperialism to subjugate
peace-loving peoples whose only “crime,” so called.
is their desire to live in freedom and to shape their
own destiny.
As the representative of Thailand has shown,
there has been a distinct possibility of incursions of
foreign military forces into Thai territory in con-
nection with engagements which have taken place
near the Thai border. This danger continues. It
may, in fact, have increased now that the Viet
Minh forces have been equipped with foreign arms
of the most modern kind. They now have a
greater capability for heavy assault and rapid
movement.
Moreover, Thailand has been the target of false
propaganda of a kind that all too often in the past
has been used to justify and prepare the way for
acts of aggression. Communist propaganda and
political agents have been utilized to promote anti-
Thai activities among the sizeable groups of refu-
gees who have found sanctuary in the border
regions of Thailand. As the representative of
Thailand has indicated, these activities have been
linked directly with the invasions of Laos and
Cambodia. The threat to Thailand presented by
these military, propagandistic, and political
actions is, therefore, real and continuing.
We have under consideration, accordingly, pre-
cisely the kind of situation for which the Peace
