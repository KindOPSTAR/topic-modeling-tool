Qualiﬁed Technlclans Are Hard To Find
At the present time there are more than 1,800
U.S. technicians serving in 42 countries of the
world. This is the largest number of technicians
America has ever sent overseas; yet the number
is not sufﬁcient to meet our goals. The Foreign
Operations Administration would like to increase
this number to 2,500 by the end of 1954.
These technicians are not easy to ﬁnd. They
must have a high degree of technical competence
in their special ﬁelds. But more than that, they
must also possess a rare understanding and an
ability to work with many peoples of different
cultures and creeds.
An American agricultural agent will rarely ex-
plain a new concept over a conference table cov-
ered with geographical charts. More often he
must leave the conﬁnes of his ofﬁce and his home
and go out into the ﬁelds with the farmers.
The public health nurse might practice her pro-
fession in a community health center. Yet fre-
quently she will be found riding for many long
hours in an 0 en jeep, over bumpy, dusty roads,
to remote vi lages out of reach of the health
center.
The rewards for these technicians are not ﬁnan-
cially great, but there is a su reme satisfaction
in knowing that yesterday a c ild aﬂlicted with
measles would develop pneumonia and die and
that today a local nurse, trained through coopera-
tive health programs, will administer penicillin
and save that child’s life.
If, in your sermons and your close contact with
your congregations, you would salute these
courageous and spirited Americans, you would not
only be giving them the recognition and honor
they so rightfully deserve but at the same time you
would encourage qualiﬁed Americans to respond
to this calling.
Ellectlvoness of Programs
I am often asked, “How can the effectiveness of
these programs be measured?” Sometimes we are
able to count the results in increased agricultural
production or in the elimination of widespread
disease or in rising attendance at a newly ﬁnished
village school. However, these statistics are often
difﬁcult to obtain. We are working in areas where
even simple population ﬁgures are frequently un-
available.
Yet, from another viewpoint, there has been
clearly noted a new spirit, an intense desire to
move ahead instead of backward. For example,
some months back in the town of Grecia in Costa
Rica a group of citizens entered the headquarters
of the joint technical cooperation mission. They
inquired if they could see the farm extension
agent. The word had gotten around to them that
this man could do things for their land that were
nothing short of a miracle. They were told that
there were not sufﬁcient funds to send him to their
village. Sadly the people of Grecia returned to
their homes.
But the desire had been planted and could not be
easily suppressed. By p0 ular subscriptions, by
passing the hat, they raised enough money to pay
the salary and expenses for their own agricultural
specialists. Recently the valiant little town held
its ﬁrst ublic ex osition of the results. The Pres-
ident of) Costa ica, the American Ambassador,
and some of our Fox people attended the fair. I
would ﬁnd it difﬁcult to measure, in terms of sta-
tistics, the local pride and overwhelmin self-con-
ﬁdence that these people have generate in them-
selves through thelr own efforts.
There is the most profound indication of the
great impact of these programs in the moving
stories that are reported from the ﬁeld. In help-
ing people to hel themselves, it is not enough that
the be furnishe the tools with which they might
bui d a better life; there must be instilled an inner
initiative, an abiding spirit that springs from
within.
One such story was recently reported to me from
our mission in Ethiopia. In the city of Jimma
the joint technical cooperation program has es-
tablished an a , icultural school under the guid-
ance of the 0k ahoma A & M Colle e. One day
last fall a very bedrag led and tire looking boy
walked into the schoo . He had traveled more
than 800 miles, mostly on foot, just to appl for
admission. He hadn t eaten for 2 days an was
obviously weak from hunger and exhaustion. He
was put in a hospital for a week, and when he was
well he took the entrance examination. He
achieved a passing grade and at this moment is
pursuing his studies. This kind of courage, this
kind of initiative and determination, can surmount
an barriers.
onds Parisien is a little hamlet on the road to
Malpasse in Haiti. In 1947 Fonds Parisien was
a dying community, dying from lack of water and
impoverished soil. Those villagers who resisted
the urge to move on were forced to live on “catie”
seeds and to cut off twigs and branches for charcoal
production as their only livelihood.
Fonds Parisien is a different place now. Arid
lands have been scientiﬁcally cultivated. Brush-
land has been planted with rice, corn, beans, and
vegetables. As farmer Toussaint Exaus put it,
“My grandmother died here from starvation. Be-
fore the irrigation came, I was forced to dress
in tatters. Now I have two new pairs of pants
with several ﬁne shirts. By our standards I am
a wealthy man.”
I do not believe any appreciation can equal that
which was shown by a young father in Iran. He
arrived one day at the joint public health service
beaming with joy. Happily he reported that at
last a son had been born and had lived. Nine pre-
vious children had died. The proud father was
