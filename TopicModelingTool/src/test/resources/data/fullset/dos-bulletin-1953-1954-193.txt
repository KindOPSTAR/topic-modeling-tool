past tendenc of countries fearing defeat before
an Arbitral ribunal to block and frustrate the
arbitration. As the Commission stated, the proj-
ect is part codiﬁcation and part development.
The Assembly has re nested the member states to
consider the articles uring the next 2 years and
supply their comments and suggestions, so that the
Assembly may consider the project again at its
1955 session.
The other two projects of the Commission, con-
sisting of draft articles on the Continental Shelf
and high seas ﬁsheries, are integral parts of a
larger project of codifying and developing all of
the various aspects of international law relatin
to the regime of the high seas and territoria
waters.
The United States has a vital interest in both
of these projects. In this connection you may re-
call the two Presidential roclamations of Sep-
tember 28, 1945.2 One proc aimed the jurisdiction
and control of the United States over the natural
resources of the subsoil and sea bed of the Conti-
nental Shelf beneath the high seas contiguous to
the coasts of the United States. In the other it
was stated that the United States considers it
pro er alone or with other states concerned to es-
tab ish ﬁshery conservation zones in areas of the
high seas contiguous to the coasts of the United
States wherein ﬁshing activities have been or in
the future may be develo ed and maintained on a
substantial scale. In suc zones ﬁshin operations
would be subject to the regulation anil control of
the one or more nations havin a real interest in
developing and maintaining t e ﬁsheries in the
zone.
THE CONTINENTAL SHELF DOCTRINE
Since 1945 several interesting developments have
taken lace in this ﬁeld. The 83d Congress of the
Unit States passed two ublic laws. One gave
to the abutting states juris iction over the sea bed
and its resources under territorial waters (P. L. 31,
approved Mag 22, 1953). The other provided for
fe eral juris iction and control over the sea bed
and its subsoil between the outer limits of terri-
torial waters and the outer limits of the Continen-
tal Shelf (P. L.212,a proved Au .7, 1953). This
latter act provides t at it shall e construed “in
such manner that the character as hi h seas of the
waters above the outer Continental helf and the
right to navigation and ﬁshing therein shall not
be affected.”
Subsequent to the United States proclamations
in 1945, several countries have made far-reaching
claims to jurisdiction over extensive areas of sea
bed and subsoil, and even the waters, of the high
seas for one or more purposes. For example, a
number of countries claim the right unilaterally to
control ﬁshing on the high seas in areas contiguous
to their coasts but which have historically been

ﬁshed b nationals of other states or in which other
nations ave a real interest. Korea and Japan are
engaged in a controversy over Korea’s ri ht to ex-
clude nationals of other countries from shing in
large areas off her coasts. En land and Iceland
are in a controversy over Icelan ’5 claims to exclu-
sive ﬁshing rights off her coasts.
The International Court of Justice recently
handed down a decision in the Anglo-Norwegian
ﬁsheries case. Japan and Australia are having a
dispute over the rights of Australia to control pearl
ﬁsheries on the sea bed off her coast, and this has
been submitted to the ICJ for decision. The sub-
'ect is one of increasing importance as a source of
international controversy, and it is signiﬁcant and
heartening that there is a growing tendency to
submit these disputes to the ICJ for decision.
The ﬁsheries articles are desi ed to promote
both the freedom of high seas ﬁs cries and inter-
national coo eration in conserving such ﬁsheries.
The Assemny postponed consideration of these
items until the International Law Commission
completes its work on all of the various phases of
the regime of the high seas and territorial waters.
The United States’ position, as you know, is that
the historic doctrine of freedom of ﬁshing in the
high seas must be maintained. The resent draft
by the Commission accords genera y with this
View.
PRISON!” OI WAR
The last development that I will mention arises
out of the conﬂict in Korea. It is the question
of prisoners of war.
The disposition of prisoners of war was the cru-
cial issue in the Korean Armistice negotiations.
This subject has been the source of international
controversy since World War II. It arises out of
the challenge by the Communists to humanitarian
attitudes toward prisoners of war which have
developed in the last century and ﬁnd legal expres-
sion in the Geneva conventions.
This challenge to the status of risoners of war
is merely a manifestation of the ommunist rin-
ciple that every subject is the creature of the tate.
The Communist looks upon a prisoner of war
as an asset of the military machine, without re-
s ect or regard for his rights as a human being.
air trial is nonexistent. Impartial third-party
observation and intervention is considered by the
Communists as, at best, a useless inconvenience
and, at worst, a threat of com lete exposure. The
Communist soldier who mi; into the enemy’s
hands is expected by the Communist, as became
apparent in the Korean camps, to continue to
ﬁght with every means at his command. Beyond
all, the Communist denies the right of a soldier
to escape the authority of his State and seek
asylum.
The Communists look upon a prisoner in their
hands as slave labor, as a tool of propaganda war-
