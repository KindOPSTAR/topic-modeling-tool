of pro a anda, may produce more results than the
forma ebates which we have previously held.
Such a subcommittee should of course consist
of France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom,
and the United States, and we believe it should
also include Canada, which occupies a unique
glace, both for reasons technically connected With
isarmament and also because of her gifts of
international moral leadership.
Mr. President, this is not a time for oratory but
for hard practical work. We may doubt whether
this committee, no matter how hard and how
sincerely it works, will be able within a short
time to solve all the vast problems of control of
atomic energy. We may well be content if we
make some tangible progress. Let us be heartened
by the thought that agreements on speciﬁc oints
can in turn lead to greater agreements an then
to genuine positive accomplishments. Would
that there were a simple formula which, even if
it could not give us full security, would at least
materially reduce the total danger which con-
fronts the world today. However, there is no
such simple formula. There is no magic wand
which we can wave and bring the millennium over-
night. There is nothing to substitute for hard
painstaking work animated b a sincere desire
to get results but not motivate by a race for the
world’s headlines.
In that hopeful spirit, Mr. President, let us
begin.
Partlclpatlon of Communlst China
U.S./U.N. press release 1904 dated April 14
Let me make two brief observations concerning
the proposal of the Soviet representative for par-
ticipation of the Chinese Communists in the sub-
committee.a
First, the Soviet proposal to include the Chinese
Communist regime is both fallacious and unwise.
What we are dlscussing here is the composition of
a subsidiary body of this commission, a subcom-
mittee, if you please, which in turn is a subsidiary
body reportinﬂ' to the General Assembl and to
the Securit Council. In the General ssembly
and in the ecurit Council representatives of the
Government of t e Republic of China sit for
China, and they are the only representatives who
can legally represent China in the Disarmament
Commission or any subsidiary bodies it may
establish.
Secondly, the United States opposes the inclu-
sion of Communist China in the subcommittee for
substantially the same reasons which cause us to
o pose representation of Communist China in the
nited Nations. And I need not take the time of
thls body this afternoon to give all those reasons
because you are thoroughly familiar with them.
° U.N. doc. DC/48 dated Apr. 14. The Soviet draft also
proposed India and Czechoslovakia as participants.
The plain truth is that commonsense tells us that
the nations which are included in the resolution of
the United Kingdom 1 are numerous enough and
responsible enough and involved enough to reach
an agreement on disarmament.
U.S. Views on Subcommlttse
U.S./U.N. press release 19071 dated April 19
Sometimes I et the impression that the repre-
sentative of the oviet Union ets so carried away
or fascinated by the rumble 0% his own voice that
he says things which on sober reﬂection later he
must regret. I am sure that he feels sorry now
that he implied, for exam 1e, that India was a
satellite because, of course it is a well-known fact
that India is an independent nation which stays
in the British Commonwealth solely because it
wants to stay in the British Commonwealth. His
inference that Canada was a satellite of the United
States, or that the United States was a satellite of
Canada—I forget which way he had it—is, of
course, equally absurd.
The Soviet re resentative seems to see satellites
everywhere, pro ably because his Government has
put so much time and energy into setting up a
monolithic satellite ediﬁce whose structure, I may
add, is as brittle as its surface is hard. He cannot
understand the fact of eople in this world doing
things because they believe in them. He cannot
understand the basic essential strength of free
peoples in which the rights and the views of every-
one, be they small or arge, weak or strong, are
res ected.
ow, Mr. President, for reasons which I have
made clear man times, the United States is op-
posed to the inclusion of the Chinese Communist
regime on the subcommittee. It is a regime which
is manifestly unﬁt to take part in this work. If
i; is put to a vote, I shall vote against including
t em.
Similarly, the United States is o osed to the
inclusion of Czechoslovakia and shall vote
against their inclusion. The whole world knows
that Czechoslovakia has neither a voice nor a vote
which it can call its own.
The Government of India in its communication
of April 8 regardin the hydro en bomb” said,
“The Government 0 India are ully aware that
any effective consideration and solution of these
problems can be reached only by the powers rin-
cipally concerned.” I stress the words “on y by
the powers principally concerned.” The repre-
sentative of the Soviet Union has produced no
evidence to indicate that India wants to be in the
subcommittee. There is every indication that the
Government of India was not consulted on the
Soviet proposal and does not, in fact, desire to
' U.N. doc. DC/47 dated Apr. 12. This draft named the
U. S., U. K., U. S. S. R., France, and Canada as members of
the ubcommittee.
