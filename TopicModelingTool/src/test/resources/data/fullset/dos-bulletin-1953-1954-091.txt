Report of U.N. Command Operations in Korea
SEVENTY-FIFTH REPORT:
U.N. doc. 8/3148
Dated December 4, 1953
I herewith submit report number 75 of the United Na-
tions Command Operations in Korea for the period 1-15
August 1953, inclusive.
The period 1-15 August marked the beginning of the
implementation of the Armistice Agreement. The result
of long and careful planning by the United Nations Com-
mand became evident as the various agencies and support
groups established by the United Nations Command to
carry out the implementation were phased into operation
on schedule.
After the exchange of credentials by both sides the
Military Armistice Commission held frequent meetings
for the purpose of adopting procedures agreeable to both
sides.
Agreement was reached on method of operation of
Joint Observer Teams which were dispatched to their
assigned areas. Marking of boundaries, clearing of
hazards and construction of the various installations were
begun within the Demilitarized Zone.
Agreement was also reached on Civil Police and the
type of arms they may carry within the Demilitarized
Zone. Neutral Nations Inspection Teams were dispatched
to the Ports of Entry of both sides.
During the ﬁrst week in August an advance party rep-
resenting the Indian contingent of the Neutral Nations
Repatriation Commission and the Custodial Forces, India,
arrived in Tokyo. This group was headed by Mr. N. K.
Nehru and Major General Thorat. The Indians were
briefed at United Nations Command Headquarters on the

FOR THE PERIOD AUGUST 1—15, 1953‘
arrangements made by the United Nations Command for
the reception of Indian troops into the Demilitarlzed Zone,
including movement, quarters and logistical support to
be provided. After this ﬁrst brieﬁng the Indian party
was ﬂown to Korea where they were met by the Senior
Member of the United Nations Command Military Armi-
stice Commission and further briefed at the site of their
prospective operations. The group then proceeded to the
Communist Headquarters where they remained for two
days. Upon their return to Munsan-ni the Indian party
met with the Senior Member United Nations Command
Military Armistice Commission and his staff at which
time the two groups drafted a tentative “Memorandum
of Understanding", with regard to facilities and support
to be furnished by the United Nations Command to the
Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission installation
within the Demilitarized Zone on the United Nations
Command side of the Demarcation Line. The Indian
party then returned to Tokyo where one more short con-
ference was held at United Nations Command Head-
quarters. At this conference the tentative “Memorandum
of Understanding", was discussed with representatives of
the Commander in Chief's, United Nations Command,
staff to the mutual satisfaction of both parties. The
Indian Advance Party then departed Toyko for India.
Adhering scrupulously to the terms of the Armistice
Agreement for the repatriation of captured personnel,
the United Nations Command commenced delivery to the
Communists on 5 August 1953, of those prisoners of war
who had expressed a desire for direct repatriation. De-
tailed plans, which had been prepared long in advance,
were implemented in order to insure orderly and emcient
delivery in accordance with the daily schedules agreed
upon by both sides. Particular care was taken to pro-
vide for the safety, comfort and well being of the sick
and injured personnel to be repatriated by our side.
As was the case during the exchange of sick and injured
captured personnel during April and May 1953, the main
difﬁculties encountered in the deliveries were created,
not by the numerous logistical and other problems nor-
mally to be expected during a move of this magnitude, but
by the prisoners themselves. Early in the exchange,
Communist returnees, obviously under orders, ripped
newly issued clothing, cast aside comfort items and, in
