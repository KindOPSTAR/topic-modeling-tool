encouraging the simpliﬁcation of customs require-
ments and recognizin the validity of the customs
bond or pass (Garnet Ye passages en douane) issued
by authorized motoring associations. It became
apparent at the conference that much more com-
prehensive provisions would be necessary eventu-
ally and that automobiles and tourists’ personal
effects represented two separate problems. So the
lines were laid for the task which is now nearing
completion.
In 1952, acting u on resolutions adopted by
the Transport and ommunications Commission
and the Economic and Social Council, the Secre-
tary-General of the United Nations circulated to
all member governments for comment the EC!
draft convention and other material. Replies in-
dicated the desirability of havin two se arate
conventions, and the Economic an Social uncil
(on the recommendation of the Transport and
Communications Commission) adopted on April
15, 1953, a resolution instructing the Secretary-
General to convene a conference of overnments
in 1954. In November the United Nations ave
notice that the conference will be held at 'ew
York City beginning May 11, 1954.
The United States position for the conference
is now being prepared at Washington, on the basis
of comprehensive documentation assembled by the
United Nations Secretariat. The principal Fed-
eral agencies concerned are the Departments of
State, Treasury, and Commerce, but the advice
of other units of government will be obtained
through the Interdepartmental Committee on
F orei Travel. Close liaison is also being main-
taine with private groups, notably motoring and
touring associations.
A fact that already has emer ed from the study
of the documents is that the nited States is one
of the most liberal countries in the world in its
treatment of international travelers. For the
foreign visitor entering the United States there
are, in the usual case, no formalities of any kind,
other than an oral declaration, for the temporary
ent of his automobile or personal effects. For
the .S. resident returnin from abroad the ex-
emption of up to $500 for ree entry of purchases
is unequaled in other countries.
If successful solutions are found at the New
York conference next May, the resulting agree-
ments among nations of the free world may be
expected to contribute greatly to the facilitation
of international travel, which in many of them is
an increasingl important economic and social
factor. For the individual motorist or tourist,
whose name is legion, advantages of the simpliﬁ-
cation of the dreaded “clearance through customs”
are manifest.

Earnings on U.S. Investments
Overseas During 1952
Earnin on U.S. investments abroad amounted
to $2.7 bil ion in 1952, the Ofﬁce of Business Eco-
nomics of the Department of Commerce announced
on December 23. According to a recently com-
pleted analysis published in the December Survey
0 Current Business, the 1952 total was slightly
a ove 1951 and nearly 50 percent larger than the
average of the 6 earlier postwar years.
Earnings of foreign investments are the sum of
the U.S. share of earnings of U.S.-controlled di-
rect investment companies (whether remitted to
this country or held abroad as undistributed sub-
sidiary earnings), receipts from foreign portfolio
securities owned by United States investors, and
receipts by the U.S. Government on credits ex-
tended abroad.
Ex ansion in earnings reﬂects the greatly en-
larg American investment abroad. This invest-
ment aided foreign-economic development and
contributed in substantial measure to meeting the
high postwar world demands for raw materials
and enlarged foreign r uirements for the broad
ran e of products turne out in increasin quan-
tity y American-owned enterprises abroa . New
postwar capital investment by these enterprises
through 1952 aggregated over $8 billion, of which
about half represented reinvested foreign earn-
ings, the Survey article states.
‘arnings of about $2.3 billion on direct invest-
ments abroad comprised 85 percent of the 1952
total. While this represented a slightly higher
amount than in 1951, the earnings remitted to the
United States declined for the ﬁrst time in the
postwar period. In 1949, there was a drop in
earnings associated with the business ad'ustment
in the United States and elsewhere, an the ac-
companying reductions in some important world
prices, but income remittances were maintained by
cuttin down on undistributed earnings. Inst
year, owever, total proﬁts were higher, but there
was a decline in remittances as earnings retained
abroad were the largest for any year. In part,
this reﬂected some im ediments to the transfer of
earnings by reason 0 exchange controls, but the
