our ople, despite the supposed concentration of
wea th, 21 million families own U.S. Government
bonds and 26 million have bank accounts.
Dlttuelen of Business Ownership
The democratic spirit of business in the United
States is also revealed by the vast numbers of
owners of the larger corporations. The Ameri-
can Telephone and Telegraph Company alone, a
type of business usually 0 erated by Government
in other countries, is own by well over a million
shareholders—more than the population of Boston
or Habana. A dozen of the larger corporations
in the United States have over 100,000 share-
holders each, and the numbers of owners have in-
creased by more than 25 percent since 1940. These
corporations might pay more dividends than they
do, despite high wages and high taxes, if it were
not for the huge amounts they are reinvesting in
the develo ment of our national economy—in new
plants an equipment. Last year this reinvest-
ment by United States corporations totaled $28
billion—creating new jobs and more oods for
consumption. This should give some 1nkling to
our friends in other countries of the capital that
might be available for development of countries
that determine to attract substantial amounts of
this capital.
One interesting distortion that I believe has
grown in the minds of people in Imtin America
concerning our methods has been caused by en-
thusiasm for the Tennessee Valley development.
This big regional project has encouraged the
thou ht abroad that really big developments in
the nited States are carried out by Government.
This is a big project, but put it in perspective by
comparing the $1 billion capital investment in
TVA with some of the ﬁ res I have mentioned,
such as the $28 billion reinvested by co rations
during 1953. There are some large pub ic power
projects in the United States, but 82 percent of
the nation’s electric energy is still being roduced
by over a quarter of a million private y owned
electric plants.
Another reason that foreigners get the impres-
sion that a large art of our economy depends on
Government is t e size of defense production.
They do not realize that the defense bud et is
onl;7 11 percent of the total output of the ation
an that most of this money is spent for equipment
produced by private ente rise.
How can we use this kind of information to
change the misconceptions that exist abroad about
our economy and about the American private en-
terprise system? We can try to see that clear
information is Widely distributed. The U.S. In-
formation Agency attempts to do this, and that
organization 1s doing excellent work with limited
funds. But here again we are faced with the
strikin contrast between the volume of private
and o cial channels of information. The U.S.
Information Agency has 100 Americans working
in Latin America. But look at the contrast with
activities of private American or nizations:
The American press services—United ress, Asso-
ciated Press, and International News Service—
have thousands of words ap aring daily in Latin
American newspapers tota ing over 12 million
copies. American motion pictures are seen in com-
mercial theaters by over a million Latin Ameri-
cans every day of the year. American magazines
have hu e circulations in Latin America: the
Readers igest about a million and a half copies
a month; and Life Magazine over 250,000 copies.
Encouragement et Lntln Amerlcen Vlsltore
Many Latin Americans ain their own impres-
sions of our economy while visiting the United
States, and we should ﬁnd wa s to encourage more
visitors. About 200,000 Latin American visitors
came to the United States last year, in addition to
people who live along the Mexican border. There
are also at least 10,000 Latin American students
in our colleges, universities, and high schools.
And as an indication of further interest in infor-
mation from our country, thousands of Latin
Americans are studying English. Over 70,000
students attend American schools in Latin Amer-
ica, and over 50,000 study English in ofﬁcially
sponsored cultural centers. These are onl a part
of the total. Likewise, libraries operate/(f7 by the
ofﬁcial Information Agency had a total circulation
of about a half million volumes.
Of course, American citizens, in their personal
relationshi s abroad, can attempt to create a better
understan ing of our economic system—our way
of life. The State Department has about 800
Americans in Latin America, and all other a. en-
cies of our Government have twice that num r.
It is, of course, one of their rincipal duties to
promote understanding. But liere again, in con-
trast, the relationships of rivate citizens are
myriad. Over 80,000 Unite States citizens live
in the 20 countries of Latin America. And to
touch on a few other examples, there are over 900
Rotary Clubs in Latin America; over 600 Lions
Clubs; the Inter-American Bar Associations in-
clude all the lawyers of the entire bar associations
in 18 of the 20 countries; the Pan American Medi—
cal Association brings together hundreds of doc-
tors every year; the Inter-American Press
Association is a forum for representatives of the
newspapers and radio stations; the General Fed-
eration of Women’s Clubs has aﬁiliated organiza-
tions in 10 Latin American countries; American
Chambers of Commerce thrive in 8 of the coun-
tries; and Junior Chambers of Commerce in 6
countries. There are many other organizations,
such as the YMCA and the wca, whose activities
contribute to mutual understanding.
I should mention the exchange of information
between labor organizations in Latin America and.
the United States. The American Federation of
Labor, the C10, and the United Mine Workers are
236
