which provide mainly for action, on commodity
by commodity. My delegation is unable to sup-
port this recommendation. The proposed commis-
sion would inevitably exercise the same general
responsibilities as the old Economic and Em lo -
ment Commission of the Council and mig it
expected to suffer from the same defects. The
establishment of a commission charged with re-
sponsibility for considering broad questions of
economic policy would simply invite duplication of
discussion, since these are questions which the
Council itself must necessarily debate.
With respect to the experts’ suggestions relating
to the use of the fund’s resourcesﬁ await with in-
terest the statement to be made by the representa-
tive of the fund. My Government, as this Council
has previously been assured, will be prepared, at
such time as it may appear necessary, to give
pro er consideration to the matter of an increase
in t e fund’s resources.
While my delegation has been unable to accept
the views of the experts on a number of points, we
have found much in their report that is useful and
constructive. We welcome particularly their
warning as to the dangers of excessive concern with
international measures and their emphasis on the
need for the ursuit by national overnments of
policies whic contribute to stabi ity. Underde-
velo countries must avoid inﬂation and prevent
the issipation in boom times of investment funds,
public revenues, and foreign-exchange earnings.
ndustrial countries can play a major role by com-
bining stead economic growth with the mainte-
nance of higli levels of employment.
We must then, Mr. President, try to deal with
this lproblem of excessive ﬂuctuations by a realistic
com ination of international and national meas-
ures.
Internationally, countries can contribute to
greater economic stability b collective efforts to-
ward relaxation of trade an currency restrictions.
\Ve can consult and cooperate to improve knowl-
edge of world supply and demand for materials
and foodstuffs.
The ﬁeld for national action is broad.
The experts have emphasized, and ri htly so,
the need for sound ﬁscal, monetary, and invest-
ment policies. They have also pro erly stressed
the importance of formulating broa development
programs and develo ing the administrative re-
sources and the political consensus necessary for
their execution.
I might talk generally of what the industrial
countries can do to promote greater economic
stability. I feel it would be more useful, however,
if I indicate speciﬁcally what my own country is
doing.
One—the United States is participating in study
groups on several basic commodities. Two—Pres-
ident Eisenhower, in his recent statement to the
Congress on foreign economic policy, recom-
mended speciﬁc measures for the relaxation or
removal of impediments to foreign trade. Three-—
in the conduct of our stockpilin programs we
reco ize an obligation to avoi actions which
woulgdihave disruptive effects upon world prices.
Four—in disposing of agricultural surpluses we
shall take special precautions to safeguard against
the substitution or dis )lacement of normal com-
mercial marketing. Eive—we are assisting the
economic development and diversiﬁcation of un-
derdeVeloped countries through our ﬁnancial and
technical assistance programs and through our
eﬁ'orts to promote conditions favorable to an in-
creased ﬂow of private investment, a matter with
which I shall deal shortly. Six—we are resolved
to maintain high levels of economic activity in
the United States. we all recognize the inﬂuence
of the economic conditions in the United States
upon world economic conditions. In his Economic
Report for the Congress, President Eisenhower
made it quite clear that the United States Govern-
ment is prepared to use its vast powers, as cir-
cumstances may require, to help maintain at home
employment and purchasing power as well as rea-
sonably stable prices. By so doing we shall be
making a major contribution to world economic
stability.
Mr. President, I have tried to make clear that
the United States not only recognizes fully the
importance and seriousness of the problem of ex-
cessive price instability, but is pursuing a con-
structive program for alleviating it.
Prlnto lnternatlonal Investment
I turn now to the international ﬂow of private
capital. The beneﬁts of private international in-
vestment are so much a part of our lives that it
takes considerable effort to separate them out for
individual scrutiny. But this we must do, for ours
is the duty to see that the world is not prevented
by any lack of vision from enjoying those beneﬁts
to the fullest.
To be sure those beneﬁts have already been sub-
stantial. In the last 2 years something like $31/2
billion of private investments abroad have been
made by U.S. citizens alone. Perha s, if the ﬂow
from Northwestern Europe were a ded, the total
of private international investment in the last 2
years would be $5 billion.
But for me those global statistics tell the story
far less impressively than do some of the speciﬁc
investment histories with which I have become
familiar as a result of in government service,
garticularly as a member 0 the Business Advisory
ouncil of the United States. Executives from
Dupont, from General Motors, from Standard of
New Jersey, and from many other leading ﬁrms
in the forei investment ﬁeld have served on the
Council whi e I have been there. These men have
told me of some of their development projects
abroad. Just recently one of them told me how
his ﬁrm had introduced a totally new and complex
industrial proce§ in a South American country.
