As in previous conferences, it was recognized as
virtually impossible to assess actual contributions
strictly in accordance with a theoretical scale. In
the ﬁrst place, there were only 21 vessels physically
available for the scheme, diwded as follows among
six states:
United States ___________________________ __ 10
United Kingdom ________________________ __ 4
France _________________________________ __ 2
Netherlands ____________________________ __ 2
Norway (and Sweden) __________________ __ 2
Canada _________________________________ __ 1
Some other states expressed an interest in oper-
ating additional ships if the could be obtained.
This possibility, however, id not materialize.
Another major stumbling block was the great dif-
ference in operating costs reported by various
operating states, together with the foreign ex-
0 ange difﬁculties which would be involved in
making cash transfers outside the Euro ean area.
After careful examination of all possibilities, the
Conference agreed that the only practicable way
to maintain 9 stations with 21 ships would be to
assign to the United States and Canada, with 11
vessels, the four stations nearest their shores (B,
C, D, and E), leaving it to states outside North
America to operate and ﬁnance the other 5 stations
(A, I, J, K, and M).
A workin group of maritime experts developed
a feasible p an for manning the latter 5 stations
with 10 vessels on a systematic rotation of patrols
and relief duty. This insured that the operational
responsibilities would be shared on an a proxi-
mately equal basis by European vessels. work-
ing group of the Financial Committee worked out
an acceptable plan whereby cash contributions by
Be] ium, Denmark, Israel Italy, and Switzerland
wo d be divided among the four European oper-
ating states in roportlon to operations in excess
of their theoretical responsibilities.
The new agreement, which is subject to accept-
ance by signatory overnments, has been signed
b 13 countries: el 'um, Canada, Denmark,
rance, Ireland, Israe , Ital , the Netherlands,
Norway, Sweden, Switzerlan , the United King-
dom, and the United States.
Spain and Iceland participated in the Confer-
ence but did not sign the agreement. They indi-
cated their willingness, however, to make ﬁnancial
contributions in sup ort of the program. The
Conference expressed) the hope that these two
states, and others which derive beneﬁts from the
network, would ﬁnd it possible to become parties
to the agreement.
Entry Into Force and Duratlon
The agreement will come into force not earlier
than July 1, 1954, when instruments of acceptance
have been deposited with Iono by governments re-
sponsible for the operation of at least 15 vessels.
It is to run for an initial period of 2 years from
July 1, 1954, with provision for automatic ex-
tension one year at a time unless denounced b one
or more states responsible in the aggregate or at
least two vessels, in cash or in kind. To safeguard
the interests of all participants, the agreement
rovides that any state is entitled to withdraw
rom the scheme as of June 30 in any year upon 12
months’ prior notice. In such cases the Council
of Icao is to seek arrangements for redistributing
the obli ations of withdrawing states and, if neces-
sary, cal a new conference. As under previous
agreements, the Ivo Council is to coordinate the
general program of operating the stations in con-
sultation with the states concerned and with such
other international organizations as it considers
appropriate. The Council is to keep the \Vorld
Meteorological Organization advised of the mete-
orological aspects of any action which it proposes
to take.
On or before March 1, 1955, each participatin
state is to furnish Icao with statistics of Nort
Atlantic crossin by its civil aircraft in 1955.
Euro n operating states are also to submit cost
data or their ships during 1954. Upon receipt of
this information the Council will review the rela-
tionship between costs of European operating
states and the amount of cash which should be
available. If it considers it necessary to establish
a more equitable distribution of responsibilities
among the states concerned, the Council is to cal-
culate a revision of the obligations to pay and the
right to receive cash in accordance with the prin-
ciples on which the new agreement is based.
Finally, the Conference requested the Council
of Icao, in consultation with interested states and
with other international bodies, to explore all pos-
sibilities of further improvements in the efﬁciency
and economy of the ocean stations network, and of
less expensive ways and means of obtaining a sufﬁ-
ciently high standard of meteorological informa-
tion in the North Atlantic.
