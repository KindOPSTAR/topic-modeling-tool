Security In the Department of State

The ﬁrst of the executive agencies to be estab-
lished under the Constitution was the Department
of State. It came into being, under an enactment
of the Con ress, in the summer of 1789. This
senior of al Departments and agencies is thus in-
vested with a tradition of service that stems from
the administration of President Washin on.
Another congressional enactment of 1 89 made
the Secretary of State the custodian of the Seal
of the United States. The eagle on the seal holds
in its right talon an olive branch, in its left a bun-
dle of 13 arrows. According to a resolution of
the Continental Congress enacted in 1782, the
olive branch and the arrow “denote the power of
peace and war.”
It is es ecially appropriate that the Department
of State ave in its oﬁicial keeping this inspiring
national seal. What the Department of State
does, or fails to do, in its contact with foreign
governments determines to an enormous extent
whether or not peace shall be reserved. The
employees of your Department of tate are keenly
aware of their important mission and their historic
traditions.
It is the Department’s mission, through di 10-
matic methods, to preserve peace. To be an o cer
of such a Department, charged with so fateful a
mission, ﬁlls me with a humble sense of pride.
But the Department of State today is much more
than a magniﬁcent abstraction. It has a staff of
dedicated men and women, who, under the leader-
ship of President Eisenhower and the direction of
Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, are exhibit-
ing a team spirit. Each of its members, whatever
his or her duties, contributes an important part to
the work of the whole. It could not be otherwise
if the Department of State is to fulﬁll its high
function.
U.S. Performance at Berlln
This spirit of dedication, which must of course
rest upon a foundation of high professional oom-

petence, could not be better illustrated than by the
team Secreta Dulles selected to accompan him
to the recentlgerlin conference of F orei ﬂims-
ters. At that conference there was an erican
delegation of whom the Nation can be proud.
Ours was not the largest delegation there, but it
showed itself second to none in performance.
Without doubt the Soviet Union’s Foreign Min-
ister, Mr. Molotov, hoped to emerge from that
conference with Western Europe and most of the
free world defenseless against the might of Mos-
cow. It turned out otherwise. For the ﬁrst time,
an American Secretary of State, in part because
of his prolonged international ex erience, in part
because of his native diplomatic air, confounded
the Russians with their own words.
The Soviet Union’s international policie which
some thought revealed a “New Look since talin’s
death, were revealed in all their crude reliance
upon force. There was, however, a “New Look”
at Berlin. It was an American look.
The \Vestern alliance showed itself at Berlin
to be strong, cohesive, ﬁrm in support of principl
against the wiles of Russia’s most resourcef
diplomat. The Foreign Ministers of Great Brit-
ain and France came, so I am informed, to have
the highest regard for the patience, thoroughness,
and understanding of Mr. Dulles’ diplomatic ap-
pgoach at that meeting. It was so stated in a
ndon dispatch last week to the New York
Times.
I have brou ht with me the record of the Berlin
discussions, w ich the Department of State pub-
lished last week.2 This is the ﬁrst time, I believe,
that a substantially verbatim record of a ma'or
international conference has been made availa Is
to the public so soon after the close of the confer-
ence. The Berlin conference adjourned on Feb-
ruary 18. This record was published on March 11,
just {:11 weeks after the four Foreign Ministers
arte .
p There is a brief passa e from the record just
published that I would 1' e to read. It provides,
