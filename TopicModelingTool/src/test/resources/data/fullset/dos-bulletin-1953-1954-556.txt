Plans for Economic Reconstruction 1950—1953
In September 1949 the Federal Republic as-
sumed authority at Bonn. Berlin, however, re-
mained isolated both politically and economically.
Berlin’s political revwal was symbolized at the
dedication of the Freedom Bell in October 1950
with Mayor Ernst Reuter’s statement, “The ebb-
tide has passed and now the ﬂood-tide has set in.”
The city’s economic revival had not yet taken
effect, and many Berliners must have wondered
what the future held in store. But the ground-
work had bcen laid when the Oflice of the U. S.
High Commissioner and the Berlin City Govern- .
ment drew up two economic programs: (1) an
industrial investment program, the objective of
which was to double 1ndustrial production and
create 250,000 new jobs between Januar 1951 and
January 1955 at an expenditure of D 1,540 mil-
lion 1 and (2) a work relief program, which gave
wor immediately to 50,000 persons.
The Investment Program
Since 1950, over a billion DM of ECA—MSA—FOA
counterpart funds generated by dollar aid to
Western Germany and Berlin have been pro-
gramed for the Berlin Investment Program.
Other funds have also gone into Berlin invest-
ment as individual ﬁrms have re laced and mod-
ernized plants and equipment. t is the counter-
part funds derived from European Recovery aid,
owever, which have given the most direct impetus
in creating new industrial capacity in Berlin and
thus new ]0bs to mitigate the city’s unemployment
problem.
These counterpart funds have ﬂowed into every
corner of Berlin’s economy. Quick results could
best be secured by means of loans to large, well-
established ﬁrms and industries such as the ma-
chinery and electrical industries. Of the billion
Deutsche mark total, DM 800 million was loaned to
Berlin manufacturing ﬁrms between 1950 and
1953. Three-quarters of this (76 percent) went to
Berlin’s larger manufacturing ﬁrms (10 percent
of the ﬁrms receiving loans). The remaining one-
quarter, or DM 200 million, went to smaller and
medium size ﬁrms. In addition, DM 50 million
U. S. counterpart funds were allotted to very small
industry and handicraft establishments, and DM
65 million went into the construction of housing in
W'est Berlin. Increasing efforts are now being
made to channel a greater proportion of U. S.
counterpart loans to small ﬁrms and to secure a
greater diversiﬁcation in Berlin’s industry.
The accompanying table shows the amounts of
U. S. counterpart programed for various parts of
West Berlin industry to individual ﬁrms, between
September 1949 and October 31, 1953.

Several Kinds of Investment Aid Needed for Berlin
Berlin’s needs are varied. There was an acute
shortage not only of long-term investment loans
for industr but also of workin capital. DM 55
million of .S. counterpart fun s were programed
since the inception of the program in 1953, in
order to provide working capital funds and
make use of industrial capacity already exist-
in in the city. Funds were also needed to ﬁnance
orders placed in Berlin b purchasers in \Vcstern
Germany and abroad, an DM 135 million of U.S.
counterpart has been programed for Order Fi-
nancing. As the conditions in \Vest Germany im-
prove, these programs are to a large extent being
taken over by the Germans and are ﬁnanced out
of German earnings and production, but at the
outset U.S. counterpart funds were essential to
economic recovery.
Recent programing for Berlin investment has
also included a type of ﬁnancing new to Germany,
the Equity Financing Program. Its purpose is to
expand production by ﬁrms with limited collateral
or conventional borrowing power, but with sound
economic potential.
This Equity Financing Program came about as
follows. In order to accelerate favorable economic
developments, the Mutual Security Agency ar-
ranged for a technical-assistance team of economic,
