can and non-American states. The third, pro-
posed by Ecuador, dealt with the American Com-
mittee on Dependent Territories (Am). The
general resolutions for the most part repeat the
views expressed in previous reso utions on this
subject namely, that colonialism in the Americas
should be promptly brought to an end and that just
claims of American States to territories in dis ute
should be supported. The resolution on the cur
contemplates the continuation of the Committee,
its convocation being left up to the Council of the
Organization of American States (Oas) “when
circumstances make this advisable.” In conform-
ity with the position generally taken on these is-
sues, the United States explained its inability to
go along with conference action upon matters in-
volving so clearly the interests and responsibilities
of friendly governments not represented. The
dele ation abstained in the vote on the two general
reso utions and voted against the one on the Amer-
ican Committee on Dependent Territories.
Editor's Note. Following is a list of statements

i from Caracas appeared in the Bulletin of March 29,

Under the cha ter of the agenda dealing with
juridical-politicalJ matters, six instruments were
submitted to the Conference for review and ap-
proval. Due to the exigencies of time, the Com-
mittee handling these items was able to com lete
action on only two of them: Convention on ip-
lomatic Asylum and Convention on Territorial
Asylum. Each of these conventions was opened
for signature at Caracas, but the United States, in
view of its traditional position regarding the prac-
tice of diplomatic asylum and considering a treaty
on the subject of territorial asylum to be unneces-
sary, did not sign either instrument. The other
instruments—American Treaty of Paciﬁc Settle-
ment, Statute for an Inter-American Court of
Justice, Statute of the Inter-American Peace
Committee, and Protocol to the Convention on
Duties and Rights of States in the Event of Civil
Strife—were returned to the Council of the CAB
variously for consultation with the governments,
study by the corresponding technical organ, and
appropriate action y the Council itself. In re-
turnin the proposed revision of the Statute of the
Inter- merican Peace Committee to the Council,
the Conference conﬁrmed the continuation of the
Committee and applauded its fruitful work in the
interest of the peace of the continent.
Economic Matters
From the speeches delivered in the opening de-
bate it was evident that economic issues were of
major importance to the Latin American dele-
gates, particularliy such problems as public ﬁnanc-
ing of economic evelopment; raw material prices
and terms of trade; stability of, and access to,
export markets; and technical cooperation. In
many of the proposals introduced by Latin Ameri-
can delegations, 1t was clear that the United States
was expected to rovide assurances or make com-
mitments which it was thou ht would provide so-
lutions to these problems. he United States was
not in a position to accept certain of those pro-
posals, owing to the incom leteness or lack of
clarity in the terminolo , t eir one-sided provi-
sions, or the fact that fills. olicy had not been
ﬁrmly established in some ﬁelds.
One of the principal accomplishments in the
economic ﬁeld, as expressed by Assistant Secreta
Holland, was the frankness and clarity wit
which the delegations presented their positions on
various problems and the understanding achieved
with respect to their respective viewpoints. He
also pointed out that accords were being reached
today on issues that had been in dis ute in past
years, and that the eriod ahead woul yield agree-
ment on problems or which solutions could not be
found today. With a view to examining further,
on the basis of new studies and developments, the
possibility of aehievin fuller agreement on prac-
tical measures for so ving these problems, the
Conference decided to convene a meetin of Min-
isters of Finance or Economy during the ast quar-
ter of 1954 in Rio de Janeiro, which will also be
the IV Extraordina Session of the Inter-Ameri-
can Economic and rSocial Council (IA—ECOSOC).
In addition to this decision, the Conference
adopted 27 other resolutions relatin to economic
development, private investment, pu lic ﬁnancin
of economic development, prices and terms 0
trade, trade restrictions, agricultural surpluses,
agrarian reform, technical assistance, the eco-
nomic resources of the continental shelf, and the
future work of the Inter-American Economic and
Social Council. In some of the more important
resolutions on these subjects, the Tenth Confer-
ence took the following action:
1. Regarding foreign private capital, recom-
mended that the American governments maintain
and adopt suitable economic measures to attract
such capital;
