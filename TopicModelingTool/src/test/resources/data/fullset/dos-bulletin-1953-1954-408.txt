roposed speciﬁc changes in the United States tax
aws. Among these are pro osals (1) to tax in-
come from foreign subsigiaries, or foreign
branches that operate and elect to be taxed as
subsidiaries, at a rate 14 percentage points lower
than the regular corporation rates and 2) to
broaden the deﬁnition of foreign taxes whic may
be credited against the United States income tax.
We feel that these recommendations, if enacted
into law, will re resent sitive unilateral action
by the United tates overnment to encourage
forei investment. '
Bi aterally, there are further steps the United
States is prepared to take. I refer to treaties for
the alleviation of double taxation. These treaties
are an integral part of the United States program
to create a favorable tax climate for international
trade and business. As of today, the United States
is a party with foreign countries to 15 treaties
relating to income taxes. Unfortunately we have
no treaty with an Latin American Republic. We
trust that, in furt erance of their expressed desire
for foreign private capital, the Latin American
Re ublics Will be receptive to our offer to meet
and) attempt to work out mutually equitable ar-
rangements to clarify international tax relations
and minimize double taxation.
The United States also continues to be inter-
ested in negotiating with other governments more
general treaties which will deﬁne the terms under
which private capital may enter and operate in
foreign countries. Discussion on a bilateral basis
looking toward the establishment of common rules
for the treatment of foreign investments would be
mutually advantageous.
We are ready to discuss these treaty matters in
the appropriate committee.
You have made clear at this Conference your
concern about the relative prices of primary prod-
ucts and manufactured goods in international
trade and the instability of raw material rices.
We agree on the importance of these pro lems.
They are, however, highly technical subjects
which are difﬁcult to treat adequately in this state-
ment. I feel these are matters for fuller discus-
sion in the appropriate committee.
In the ﬁeld of primary production we have
problems in my own country. The United States
as always been a major roducer and exporter of
agricultural products. oday we are confronted
with large surpluses arising in part from the great
efforts to relieve shortages of farm products result-
ing from the devastation and destruction of World
War II. It is worth noting that one of the pri-
mary causes of these surpluses has been our at-
tempt to maintain too rigid a relationship between
the prices of farm products and other prices.
One result has been to price our agricultural
products out of many foreign markets.
It takes time to adjust our agricultural econ-
omy to the more normal demand which has now
developed. Legislation has been recommended to
the Congress which, it is hoped, will hasten these
adjustments. In the meantime, my Government
is keeping its international responsibilities ve
much in mind in dealing with this roblem. It is
taking precautions to prevent, so ar as possible,
the disposal of our surpluses from interfering
with normal marketings of friendly countries.
Our interest in the economic subjects under dis-
cussion at this Tenth Inter-American Conference
is reﬂected in the fact that, in addition to the
representatives of the Department of State, m
Government is also represented by W. Randolph
Burgess, Deputy to the Secretary of the Treasury '
Samuel W. Anderson, Assistant Secretary of
Commerce; our re resentative on the Inter-Amer-
ican Economic an Social Council, your longtime
friend, Ambassador Merwin L. Bohan; Maj. Gen.
Glenn E. Edgerton, Managing Director of the Ex-
port-Import Bank, together with members of their
staffs. hese gentlemen are here to participate
in our committee discussions.
Many of our problems are not susceptible of
easy or once-and-for-all solutions. This much can
be said with assurance: Not only during this Con-
ference but in the months and years to come there
will be continuing and friendly consultations
among us. We will constantly seek to develop
with you constructive economic policies based on
the mutuality of our interests.
It is for these reasons that we welcome and sup-
ort the suggestion made here for a special
onomic Conference. Possibly the extraordi-
nary meeting of the Inter-American Economic
and Social Council, planned for this year, would
serve this purpose.
In friendshi and with a feeling of common
destiny, we sha I strive to work out with you eon-
structive solutions to our common problems.
Secretary Dulles Returns
From Caracas Conference
Press release 133 dated March 14
Following is the temt o a statement made by
Secretary Dulles on Marc 14 on his return from
the Tenth Inter-American Conference at Caracas,
Venezuela:
I am very satisﬁed with the results so far ob-
tained at the Inter-American Conference at
Caracas. Yesterday, the [Politico-Juridical]
Committee, with only the ne ative vote of Guate-
mala made a momentous dec aration of principle.
In eﬁ'ect, it makes as the international olicy of
this hemisphere a portion of the Monroe octrine
which has largely been forgotten and which re-
lates to the extension to this hemisphere of the
political system of despotic European powers.
Useful discussions have been going on with
reference to economic and commercial matters,
