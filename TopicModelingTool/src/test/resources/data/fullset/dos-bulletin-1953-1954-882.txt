Amending the Atomic Energy Act
Statement by Secretary Dulles 1
I a reciate the opportunity to testify before
your gimmittee in support of the foreign olicy
aspects of the bills to amend the Atomic nergy
Act of 1946.
Since 1946 much has happened. At that time
the United States had a unique position—virtually
an exclusive position—with regard to the utiliza-
tion of atomic energy. We were prepared to
donate our unique body of knowledge to a depend-
able international organization. Having it within
our power to dominate the world by force—some-
thin contrary to eve principle of our national
mora ity—we propose voluntarily to divest our-
selves of that power and lace it under interna-
tional control. Never in isto has any nation
made a com arable proposal. t was rejected by
the Soviet nion, which thereby must assume
before history the consequences which may come
from its stubborn choice that this vast power of
human destruction should be a national rather
than an internationalized asset.
In 1946 it seemed that, subject to ossible inter-
nationalization, total secrecy would st serve the
interests of our nation and of all humanity. Since
1946 such monopoly as we had has ended. To
some extent that was due to treachery and treason.
But we would be foolish not to rate highly the
scientiﬁc capabilities of the Soviet Society. It is
not easy to estimate the relative roles played by
different factors; but we do know that in combi-
nation they have led to a situation such that our
potential enemies have a knowledge vastly supe-
rior to that of most of the nations which we count
as friends.
This is an unhealthy state of affairs. It means
that the present very strict secrecy requirements
of the 1946 Act no longer represent the wisest in-
ternational policy. We need to assert leadership
in turning atomic energy to the peaceful service
of mankind. To some extent this is merely en-
lightened self-interest, since if we do not take this
step our foreign raw-material sources will tend to

dry up and be turned to uses for which others may
suppl the technology. Also we need to equip
our allies with the knowledge which will enable
them to counter the kind of atomic warfare which
we know the Communist forces are equipped to
wage.
The pending bill would serve these foreign
policy objectives. These objectives are both indis-
ensable and urgent. They call for action apart
rom the important domestic aspects of the pro-
posed legislation.
lnternatlonal Cooperation—Peaceful Uses
About 2 weeks ago it was announced that the
1954 thermonuclear testing in the Paciﬁc was ﬁn-
ished. Speaking of this testing, the Chairman of
the Atomic Energy Commission, Admiral Strauss,
had earlier said “. . . one important result of these
hydrogen bomb developments has been the en-
hancement of our military capability to the point
where we should soon be more free to increase our
emphasis on the peaceful uses of atomic power—
at ome and abroad.” 2 As I see it, a main pur-
pose of the proposed legislation is to do just that—
“to increase our emphasis on the peaceful uses of
atomic power at home and abroad. ’
In London, disarmament ne otiations in the
United Nations Disarmament ommission Sub-
committee are going on. We are searching for a
long-term solution to the problem of ever-increas-
ing armaments. Here at home we are searchin
for interim techniques to permit peacetime uses 0
atomic energy to go forward until we ﬁnd a solu-
tion to the armaments problem. We cannot any
longer adhere to the theory that knowledge, be-
cause it is capable of use for destruction, must be
denied for uses of construction.

proposed his international atomic ener y agency

Assembly.a By amendin the Atomic Energy Act
