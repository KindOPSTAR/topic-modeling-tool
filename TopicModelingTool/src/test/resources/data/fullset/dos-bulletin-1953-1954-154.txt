the United States has assmned in the defense of
democracy, not only in this hemisphere but in
Asia and Europe as well. Some say that the
United States has not paid enough attention to
Latin America. It is only fair to point out in
this regard that most of the burdens we have
shouldered are as vital to Latin America as they
are to the United States. In resistin aggres-
sions upon the free world, we have set up ulwarks
against ag ion not only for ourselves but for
the entire Iemisphere. By providin economic
assistance to nations in other parts 0 the world
we have he] (1 to open up markets for the prod-
ucts of Latin America. At the same time, we
are continuin to provide economic aid in this
hemis here where it is most needed.
Per laps no nation of the Americas has had more
evidence than Cuba of the way this policy has
helped open up markets for its roducts. The
beneﬁts have been felt throughout t 1is hemis here.
The United States is profoundly interests , par-
ticularly at this time, in hi her standards of livin
for its sister republics, an also in their nationa
development and in their solidarity against com-
munism. I believe that good men throu hout this
hemisphere will agree that the goals of t e United
States and of Latin America are essentially the
same.
I can tell you that the people of my country, of
all economic grou s, are making great personal
sacriﬁces, in the orm of taxes, to help build a
better world. The entire system of defense of the
free world against Communist imperialism de-
pends upon our economic, political, and military
cooperation. There can be no uestion but that
the defense of the free world epends in large
degree on the fundamental soundness of the United
States economy.
Ferelgn Investment Capltal
Let me speak for 'ust a moment about foreign
investment capital. tin America is undergoin
terriﬁc industrial growth, and there is eat fait
and optimism in the future. Milton isenhower
called it “a continent in transition,” practically
vibratin from the hammers of construction. Yet
the PreSIdent’s brother found a crying need for
more ca ital to promote sound economic develop-
ment. This capital should, of course, come pri-
marily from local investors, but forei private
capital has to play an important comp ementary
ro e.
United States private investment in Latin
America is very substantial—six billion dollars.
Latin America is second only to Canada in the
entire world in the amount of United States
private investment.
Private capital ﬂows to foreign countries when-
ever there are opportunities for it. Private cap-
ital must be attracted. And to be attracted there
must be adequate opportunities for fair proﬁt,
reasonable provisions for the transfer of earnings,
equitable labor and management laws, and free-
dom from fear of discrimination or expropriation.
It should not be overlooked that there still is broad
investment opportunity at home for our own cap-
ital. It does not have to go abroad unless it is
wanted and is sure of fair treatment. I know that
you businessmen, who fully realize that Cuba
offers new frontiers to foreign investment, will
agree with this.
Far more than most eople realize, the United
States well knows the vaIlue of forei n capital. It
was foreign capital which helped build the vast
railroad networks, the acking plants, the steel
mills, and hundreds ofp other industries in my
countr . In nearly every case the investor was
rewar ed with a more than fair return. And most
important, there were no restrictions against re-
mitting earnings abroad. Eventually the young
American nation developed its own capital, bought
out the original foreign owners, and launched it-
self on a period of eat prosperity, a period which
has never stoppe . The free enterprise system
has proved itse f the most successful ever known
in history, roviding not on] proﬁts for the in-
dustrialist at a higher stan ard of living stem-
min from broader employment and fuller lives
for t e worker.
Labor-Management Relatlens
No discussion on an economic theme, however
brief, can avoid reference to the complicated prob-
lem of labor-mane ment relations. I believe that
nowhere can we nd a better deﬁnition of what
they should be than that given in a recent speech
by Benjamin F. Fairless, chairman of the board
of the United States Steel Corporation. He said:
To live better we must produce more; but production
is the result of teamwork, not of conﬂict. We shall
achieve our fullest measure of production only when we
begin to understand that the interests of worker and
owner are not antagonistic, but identical—that under our
American system of competitive enterprise. it is impos—
sible over a period of time for one to prosper while the
other suil'ers.
I am dee ly appreciative of the opportunity to
appear be ore you toni ht, and profoundly
touched by the personal tri ute you have paid me.
And as we round the corner together into 1954.
my doc and abiding wish is prosperity and hap-
piness or Cuba and her people.
