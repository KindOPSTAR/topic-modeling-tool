ferred previous] , is heartening evidence of the
effective use ina e of the aid given b the United
States to postwar reconstruction and evelopment.
Increasin ly, foreign countries are resuming do-
mestic p0 icies aimed at maintaining budgetary
balance and stable prices. United States aid was
intended to help, and has he] ed, these countries
bridge the difficulties and re uce the burdens of
postwar economic readjustment. It could not, of
course, serve as a substitute for ﬁnancial measures
needed to achieve internal balance.
Progress Toward a Free World Economy
The vitality of free institutions has enabled them
to survive the strain of two world wars and a world
depression of great magnitude. In spite of the
growth of economic controls arising from these
events, the tradin system of the free world is still
mainly one in which transactions are conducted by
private enterprises rather than b governments.
‘lie interference of the State with competitive
market forces has receded from its wartime peak.
Economic reconstruction and the recovery of pro-
duction have in most countries been accompanied
by a relaxation or removal of price controls, ration-
ing, state buying, and trade and exchange restric-
tions. In spite of new strains and temporary
setbacks associated with the Korean war, notable
rogress has been made since 1950 in returning to
r economic processes. But much remains to be
done before an enduring balance of international
transactions in goods and currencies is re-estab-
lished.
There is a eneral recognition, here and abroad,
of the need or a freer system of trade and pay-
ments. It is a responsibility of governments to
create and maintain the circumstances in which
private traders can conduct their transactions with
the fewest impediments from exchange controls or
trade restrictions. Sustained prosperity in an in-
terdependent world is a task of all free nations,
working together.
The progress already made toward liberaliza-
tion of international trade and payments should
be continued by vigorous efforts to reduce the re-
maining barriers that stand in the way. Among
these impediments are the uncertainties arising
from the sensitivity of other economic areas to
ﬂuctuations of the United States economy. The
program of action outlined in this Report to
strengthen the forces of economic growth and re-
sistance to deﬂation, combined with the determina-
tion of the Federal Government to employ all of
its powers to prevent severe slumps in the future,
should be as reassuring to the peoples of other
countries as it is to the people of the United States.
In common with other countries, the United States
is determined to continue its efforts to attain the
common objective-4 steadily expanding world
economy.
Domestic summit Stolllllty
A policy to promote economic owth and sta-
bility cannot be limited to our omestic affairs,
but must, of necessity, extend to our relations with
other nations. One of the basic lessons of history
is the interdependence between prosperity at home
and prosperity abroad; between depression at
home and depression abroad. This close link
might conceivably be broken by the ado ition of
nationalistic measures, tending to isolate individ-
ual nations and areas from outside ﬂuctuations.
The objections to such olicies are, however, over-
whelming. The sacri ces in economic eﬂiciency
and living standards which they involve have long
been emphasized and need not be restated. The
rigid controls necessary to keep such an economy
in balance would be intolerable. Equally im-
ortant, economic isolation is no guarantee of
internal stability. The severity of the depression
of the thirties was aggravated by the nationalistic
character of the rograms deVised to combat it,
as “beggar-my-neighbor” policies spread currency
depreciation, tariff increases, import restrictions,
and exchange controls from country to country.
Flexible trade and capital movements, supple-
mented b cooperative policies between overn-
ments an central banks, are far more li ely to
help stabilize national economies, to cushion the
impact of domestic disturbances, and to prevent
their spreading to the world at large.
The system toward which we must work is one
which will provide increasing opportunities for
mutually advantageous trade among the free na-
tions, and which can operate without the repeated
extension of grants-of-aid from any nation. There
is no single measure by the United States or any
other nation which can bring such a system into
being. Its achievement will call for a variety of
measures on the part of all nations. The prin-
cipal contribution that the United States can make
to the achievement of an efﬁcient system of inter-
national trade and payments is to maintain a
vigorous, healthy, and expanding economy.
Reduction of International Benton
This, however, is not enough. World trade has
been conducted in years past under the constant
threat of the erection of new trade barriers by all
of the major importing countries. In the case of
the United States, as our foreign trade policy has
been debated from year to year, other nations have
come to entertain doubts concerning its continuity.
Although we have in fact carried out vigorous
tariff-reducing programs in recent years, we have
undertaken these measures in an atmosphere of
constant uncertainty. Our trade policy and cus-
toms administration should provide a sense of
continuity, stability, and forward movement to
the rest of the world.
These licies of the United States should facili-
tate, an be accompanied by, similar measures by
