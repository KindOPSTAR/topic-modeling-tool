foolish to attempt a regional organization. But
the conditions were there. Consequently, the or-
ganization was possible.
The situation in the Paciﬁc is very different.
In the past decade the area has witnessed the
birth of many new national states preoccupied in
large measure with their internal problems and
still distracted to some extent by memories of
Western colonialism.
The idea that Communist imperialism is the
immediate and major threat has been slow in
taking hold. Some have come to recognize this
menace more rapidly than others. Conse uently,
we cannot expect to ﬁnd a positive tren afoot
aiming at the establishment of a Paciﬁc coalition.
In addition, as of now, the type of relationships
between the nations of the Paciﬁc area necessary
before collective action can be effected is as yet
undeveloped. Several Far Eastern nations have
failed to conclude treaties with Japan, and sev-
eral have not recognized the Associated States.
Althou h these divergencies may not be serious
in the ong run, they militate against the kind
of cooperation and collaboration upon which real
regional securit depends.
To those who know the region and its problems,
it is clear that the initiative for a Paciﬁc regional
grouping must come from the Asian countries
themselves. The leadership must develop there.
This country can only stand ready to encourage
the movements, to give support when needed, and
to participate when invited. The fundamental
decisions on Asiatic-Paciﬁc security must be made
by Asians themselves.
Growth at Inter-Asian Understandlng
It is encouraging to note that the speciﬁc con-
ditions mentioned earlier, on which the develop-
ment of a Paciﬁc pact rests, are coming into being.
Inter-Asian understanding is growing. And rec-
ognition of the true character of Communist im-
perialism is spreadin steadily. The Communists
themselves have aide the spread of this recogni-
tion is no small fashion. Their attack on the Re-
ublic of Korea, their performances at Panmun-
jom, their war in Indochina—all these reveal them
in their true colors. And as they continue to press
their strategy of conquest, their identiﬁcation as
imperialists, as the exponents of a new and pecul-
iarly vicious twentieth-century colonialism, be-
comes more and more clear.
While it has not been ossible to bring an
“Asian NA'ro” into being, t e United States has
been contributing to a strengthening of the free
world’s defense in the area. As part of our con-
tribution, we have concluded a series of bilateral
security agreements with Paciﬁc powers. The
agreement with Australia and New Zealand,
known as ANZUS, has been operative for several
years now. “7e also have pacts with the Republic
of the Philippines and with Japan. The pact
with the Republic of Korea has already been ap-
proved by the United States Senate. While these
agreements are similar in framework, the are
separate and distinct—each from the other. hey
contain no rovisos which could offer obstruction
to a regiona agreement. Indeed, it is conceivable
that their effect would be quite the reverse.
In the most practical of terms, cooperation, be-
tween individuals or between nations, is a habit
that requires cultivation. I believe we can ex-
ect that, under the spur of Communist ambitions
in Asia and the Paciﬁc, the nations of the area
will move toward collective action as the only
practical safeguard against the Red aggressor.
The United Nations Economic Commission for
Asia and the Far East is another activity that is
helping to cultivate the habit of cooperation about
which we have talked. In Ecara we ﬁnd a highly
diverse group of nations which have joined hands
to tackle regional economic and social problems.
Their efforts have already met with some success.
Perhaps it is signiﬁcant that collective action is
ﬁrst going forward in the ﬁeld of economics, be-
cause it is there that some of the most ressing and
immediate diﬂiculties are to be foun .
Japan's Economlc Needs
As mentioned earlier, itis essential that Japan
ain sufﬁcient strenlgth to assume responsibility for
Jerown defense. 9 do so,,the Japanese economy
must add a goodrdeal of muscle. And the neces-
sary muscle will not be easily developed. The
country is now under terriﬁc pressure from a rap-
idly expanding population. Without ». corre-
s ondi increase in economic activity, levels of
living Will drop rather than rise and make Japan
susceptible to the spread of Communist subver-
sion within its borders. Pressures would also
increase for trade with Communist China.
Because of this as well as the economic require-
ments of effective self-defense, a large and expand-
ing yplume of J apanese industrial production and
foreign, trade _is_ essential. \Ve must be frank
enough to recognize that this will not be ossible
unless the U.S. is willing to continue to Iliad the
world in reducing trade barriers and increasing
purchasing power in the free world. With the
end of the ﬁghting in Korea, the end of our special
expenditures in Japan is in sight, although it will
probably be a year or more before the full impact
of this move is felt. What we do to take up the
slack in this situation will in large measure deter-
mine the economic future of Japan.
Japan’s industrial recovery since the war has
been phenomenal. Its present industrial produc-
tion is half again what it was in 1940, and its
capacity is thought to be equal to 25 percent of
the Soviet Union’s. The problem facing Japan
today, therefore, is how to employ this industrial
production to cut down the imbalance in Japanese
trade.
