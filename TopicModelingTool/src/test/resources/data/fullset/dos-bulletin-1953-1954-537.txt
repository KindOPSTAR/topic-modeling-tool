and em ty shell cases found within the territory
of the erman Federal Republic conﬁrm that the
attack was carried on at 1402 hours central Euro-
pean time at an estimated altitude of 6,000 feet
when the American aircraft were ﬂying over the
territory of the German Federal Republic. This
penetration of the German border by the Czecho-
slovak MIG 15 ﬁghter took place near the town
of Waldmuenchen, lon itude 49 degrees 23
minutes north and latitu e 12 degrees 43 minutes

The Embassy wishes to express its regrets for
the unintentional violation of the Czechoslovak
territory by American aircraft but must at the
same time protest against the unjustiﬁable hostile
acts committed by Czechoslovak ﬁghters against
American aircraft.
The Embassy wishes also to request that investi-
gation be undertaken regarding both the unwar-
ranted attack on American aircraft and the viola-
tion of the territory of the German Federal Re-
public by at least one Czechoslovak MIG 15
ﬁghter plane. The Embassy would appreciate
being informed of the results of the investigation
as well as disciplinary action taken against the
guilty persons involved.

entered Czechoslovak air space in the area sout 1-
west of Domazlice at 12 degrees 51 minutes 40

seconds latitude. The aircraft ﬂew in from the
U.S. zone of Germany and continued to ﬂy over
Czechoslovak territory up to an area east of
Jachymov at 13 degrees 8 minutes 15 seconds

On meeting a Czechoslovak military aircraft,
the U.S. planes disobeyed an order to follow it
and attempted to attack it. The Czechoslovak
pilot was forced to ﬁre in self-defense. Both U.S.
lanes then disappeared in the clouds. ‘he
Iinistry of Foreign Affairs wishes to express the
most determined protest on behalf of the Czecho-
slovak Government against this repeated serious
violation of Czechoslovak air space by U.S. mili-
tary aircraft.
