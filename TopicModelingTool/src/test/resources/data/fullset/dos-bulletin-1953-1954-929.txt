taining military information, alleged “confes-
sions” of ilt, as well as conversion to communism.
I woul now like to review with on some other
accomplishments of the United Nations during the
past year from the point of view of America’s ar-
ticipation and America’s national interests. f it
is not an unbroken record of success, it is far from
a record of failure.
Probably the achieVement which has most
meaning to the American people was the armi-
stice in Korea. You will recall that before this
was achieved the ﬁghting had dragged on for
months because the Communists were unwilling
to agree that prisoners must not be forced to
return to the Communist world against their will.
The Communists were ﬁnally compelled to give
way before the cumulative pressure of world pub-
lic opinion and the unrelenting moral and mili-
tary force of the United Nations led by the United
States. As a result of the armistice, the ﬁght-
ing came to a halt. The killing and woundin of
American, Korean, and other Allied sol 1ers
stopped. Aggression had been halted by collective
action through an international organization for
the ﬁrst time in history—and this without a
global war. When the Communists ﬁnally yielded
and the principle of nonforcible re atriation was
put_i_nto practice, the reason for ommunist op-
ition to this princi le became only too clear.
e vast majority of e men who had lived and
fought under communism refused to return to
their countries. In contrast, the overwhelming
majority of Republic of Korea and United Na-
tions soldiers held b the Communists chose to
return to the side of reedom. What a damagin
blow this was to the pretensions of communism
Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission
Now after nearly a year has passed the armi-
stice, though uneasy, still holds. This is not to
say that there have not been difﬁculties. One of
the most troublesome has been the persistent Com-
munist efforts to frustrate the operations of the
Neutral Nations Su erviso Commission.
The members 0 this ommission, you will
recall, are Sweden, Switzerland, Poland, and
Czechoslovakia, and its job is to check on the
observance of the armistice provisions on both
sides of the line. All members of the Commission,
including the two Communist satellite members,
have been given complete access to observe in the
area held by the Republic of Korea and the United
Nations Command, in accordance with the terms
of the armistice. The Communists, on the other
hand, have placed all manner of obstacles in the
way of the Swiss and Swedes to prevent them from
carrying out their observation functions in North
Korea. This situation is summed up in no uncer-
tain terms by the neutral Swiss and Swedish mem-
bers of the Commission. They recently charged
that the Czech and Polish members of the Com-
Jul”
mission in falsely alleging armistice infractions
by the United Nations Command, were guilty of
“malicious fabrications, atuitous distortions,
misleading half-truths, an delusive insinuations
without foundation in reality. The methods re-
sorted to consist largely in isolating facts and
ﬁgures from their proper context an in making
sweeping generalizations on the basis of premises
thus distorted.”
Moreover, the Swedish and Swiss members con-
cluded that the control activities of the ﬁxed neu-
tral nations inspection teams in Communist-held
territory “are not being carried out satisfactorily
and in full accord with the spirit of the Armistice
Agreement, owing to the restrictive practices im-
posed on the activities of the teams b their
Czechoslovak and Polish members.” An yet, in
the face of this disgraceful Communist record, the
Communists at Geneva have had the audacity to
praise the working of this Neutral Nations Super-
visory Commission in Korea and to suggest that
the Poles and the Czechs help to supervise a pos-
sible future armistice in Indochina.
The Communists have been equal] noncoopera-
tive at Geneva, where the United tates, the Re-
ublic of Korea, and its United Nations allies have
been seeking to bring about the eaceful uniﬁca-
tion of a free and inde endent orea. Molotov,
Chou-en-lai, and their orth Korean puppets have
been attacking the United Nations at meetin after
meeting. They have refused to agree to nited
Nations supervision of elections in Korea. In-
stead their proposal revolves around an all-Korean
commission which in eﬂ'ect would give the Com-
munists a veto over eve decision and would make
free elections impossib e. Moreover, they want
this same United Nations Supervisory Commis-
sion, with a built-in veto given to the Poles and
Czechs, to help supervise elections in Korea.
We cannot and will not permit the Communists
to undermine the role of the United Nations in
Korea or to sell the proposition that the United
Nations itself is an aggressor. The Korean war
made a reality of the princi is of collective se-
curity against aggression. e do not intend to
accept any proposal which would unify Korea
through undemocratic methods or which would
fail to recognize the legitimate function of the
United Nations in Korea. We will not permit the
Communists to obtain a repudiation of the very
principle for which so many United Nations
members, especially ourselves, have made great
sacriﬁces.
Another way in which the United Nations can
play a leading role in our search for a better world
is epitomized by President Eisenhower’s proposals
before the Eighth General Assembly for the cre-
ation of an international atomic pool devoted to
peaceful purposes. These proposals electriﬁed
the world. Secretary Dulles followed up the
President’s address with extended diplomatic talks
