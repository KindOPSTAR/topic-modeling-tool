and a better understanding will, I am conﬁdent,
come out of the Conference.
We have had good results so far primarily be-
cause we were advocating a cause which was good,
namely, the integrity and political and economic
well-being of this hemisphere. Also, we have had
a very ﬁne delegation, and I want to pay tribute
to the hel that was rendered by Senator Hicken-
looper, w o returns with me, and Senator Green,
who is returning on Monday. These two mem-
bers of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
have dealt articularly with Latin American
affairs, and tgeir advice to me was of the utmost
value. Also, Ambassador Lodge who returns
with me, was able to make a si iﬁcant contribu-
tion. His work with the Unite Nations gave him
an intimate acquaintanceshi with Latin Ameri-
can problems and with the eading personalities
of Latin America.
The new Assistant Secretary for Inter-Ameri-
can Aﬁairs, Mr. Holland, was sworn into his job
in Caracas and is now carrying on as my deput .
Many important problems remain to be dea t
with, and I am particularly anxious that better
understandings be reached in relation to economic
and social matters of common concern.
America, Japan, and the Future of the Paciﬁc
by Deputy Under Secretary Murphy 1
One hurdle I am sure will not be a problem this
evening. I do not have to convince this group
that the United States, is involved in the future of
the Paciﬁc.
That the United States is a Paciﬁc power is a
fact just beginning to dawn upon some parts of
this country. There are a few perhaps in other
regions of our country who still have to be
convinced.
The truth is that today the interests of the
United States are worldwide. It is dangerous to
think exclusively in terms of either the Atlantic
or the Paciﬁc. It is equall dangerous to neglect
either. The future of both concerns the United
States intimately.
The threat to both is the same. The ambitions
of Soviet imperialism are universal. Its goal has
always been world domination.
In the Paciﬁc the Communists have three cur-
rent objectives. They are (1) the manpower of
China; (2) the industrial capacity of J a an; and
(3) the resources of Southeast Asia. he ﬁrst
objective has been attained. The 450 millions of
China today are laboring under the yoke. How
long that situation will last may be a $64 ques-
tion—but today it is a fact. It is of course an
unhappy fact for the free world as well as the

Chinese themselves. Communist control of the
Chinese mainland has meant the death, we are
told, to date, of 15 million Chinese, either through
starvation or liquidation. To the Communists
that was not a tragedy. Manpower, as they see
it, is expendable.
Moscow Communists found Chinese manpower
useful in Korea. They wanted Korea as a take-
off for Japan. They were quite Willin to die to
the tune of a million or so North I orean and
Chinese Communists to attain that objective. The
Chinese Communist leaders coo rated. To them
what were a million lives? ‘The innumerable
black-haired eople who grow rice,” as someone
once describe the Chinese peasants.
While the Communist objective in Japan is also
manpower, there emphasis is rather on the in-
dustrial skills of the people and Japan’s pro-
ductive plant.
Japan was the ﬁrst of the Asian nations to in-
dustrialize. Today, 9 years after a war that dev-
astated large areas, she is again producing. Pro-
duction is now 50 percent more than it was in 1940.
Her industrial capacity is estimated at 50 percent
of that of the Soviet Union—this for a nation with-
out material resources of its own, with 87 million
people crowded into an area of only 147,690
square miles, considerably less than that of
California.
We are proud that Japan has made an amazing
recovery with American cooperation and support.
