Observation Commission was created. It cannot
be disputed that—quotin the words from the
Unitin for Peace Reso ution ‘—“. there
exists in the area] international tension the con-
tinuance of which is likely to endanger the main-
tenance of international peace and security.” The
United States Government, accordingly, strongly
sup orts the re nest of the Government of Thai-
lan and urges t is Council to act with all possible
speed to authorize the Peace Observation Com-
mission to send observers to Thailand.
The resolution which the representative of
Thailand has just presented to this Council ap-
ears to have been drafted with the eatest care.
t addresses itself to the condition of international
tension which exists in the general region in which
Thailand is located. The resolution appears to us
to be utterly devoid of controversial matter. Its
objective is simply to enable a subcommission of
the Peace Observation Commission to dispatch
observers to Thailand and itself to visit that na-
tion in order to determine the facts and report on
t iem.
Since the threat to Thailand originates beyond
its borders, the resolution authorizes the subcom-
mission, if it considers it necessary for the accom-
lishment of its mission to observe in other states
in the area, to so report to the Peace Observation
Commission or to the Security Council with a
view to obtaining further instructions. On this
basis, the Peace Observation Commission or the
Security Council would be in a position to author-
ize the subcommission to extend the area of obser-
vation to other parts of the region. This is 9.
r0 er and essential com onent of the resolution.
Vit out this provision, t e subcommission mi ht
be prevented from ascertaining the very in or-
matlon necessary to any appraisal of the situation
which we may be called upon to make. In short,
it is impossible for us to see how any member of
this Council can ﬁnd any basis for objection or
reservation with regard to the roposal suggested
by the representative of Thai and. I therefore
request, under Rule 38 of our Rules of Procedure,
that at the appropriate time this resolution be put
to the vote.
I urge the members of this Council not to per-
mit themselves to be diverted from the simple but
urgent issue which is before us. We are not asked,
nor are we required, to make any ﬁndin s on the
situation in Indochina. We are not asked. and we
should not attem t, to do anything which could
even remotely a versely affect the negotiations
still continuing in Geneva. The United States has
cooperated in the effort to ﬁnd a basis at Geneva
for a settlement of the Indochina problem which
‘ BULLETIN of Nov. 20, 1950, p. 823.
would restore peace and securit in the area and
at the same time recognize the egitimate aspira-
tions of the peoples of Laos, Cambodia, and
Viet-Nam.
All we are asked to do here is to authorize a
factﬁnding body to proceed to the area where this
tension crusts in order that the United Nations
may receive impartial ﬁrsthand reports on the
situation. If its reports do not bear out Thailand’s
estimate of the danger to international eace, we
shall have discharged our responsibility fiilly. If,
on the other hand, its reports do bear out this esti-
mate, we shall then be in a positiOn to consider the
danger in the light of all available facts and to do
what we can to avert it.
A loyal member of the United Nations has
appealed to this body to take a simple action in
the interest of its own peace and security. The
action requested lies within the competence of this
Council. Its urgency is manifest. Let us act
promptly and thereby discharge our responsibility
under the Charter to maintain international peace
and security.
