Progress Toward Solving Current International Problems
by Under Secretary Smith 1
I am honored to be with you today and to sub-
stitute for Secretary Dulles, who would be here
himself if the Berlin Conference had ended a few
days earlier. As it is he returned Friday evening
and will probably have to leave for Caracas at the
end of the week. This brief period between the
termination of one major international conference
and the beginning of another one of equal impor-
tance is all too short for taking stock. Mr. Dulles
is reporting to the Congress today and will report
to the Nation tomorrow on Berlin. I do not want
to anticipate this full report, but I can say that,
while we made no progress in uniting Germany or
in liberating Austria, the Conference nevertheless
achieved a major advance in international politics.
Analysts of international affairs have referred
to a Western victory at Berlin, and I believe that
they are justiﬁed in so doing. I also agree
thorou hly with one of them who wrote last week
that “gecretary Dulles, in one of the reat di lo-
matic performances of the generationﬁiad de ned
the anti-Communist position so clearly and ﬁrmly
that Molotov’s room for maneuver was taken
away.” The Soviet Foreign Minister was com-
gelled to disclose, in terms most repugnant to
uropean neutralists and most revealing to those
in this count who still indulge in wish 111 think-
ing, that SoV1et Russia has not changed its basic
world strategy. The Soviet Union is not willin
to relax its grip anywhere and would like to exten
its power if it can. The result has been to erase
the effect of months of Soviet propaganda efforts.
For about a ear, ever since Stalin’s death, many
responsible uropean statesmen have been sug-
gestin , with renewed ho e, that it may now
possib e for the West to Seal fruitfully with the
new re 'me in the Kremlin. Molotov not only
deman ed the abandonment of the European
lAddress made before the Chicago World Trade Con-
ference, Chicago, 111., on Feb. 23 (press release 89).
Army concept but also insisted on the dismember-
ment of NATO and the total termination of U.S.
military support to Euro e.
I have attended most ofpthe previous conferences
of Foreign Ministers and I had dailIZ detailed re-
ports of this one. This is the most 5 illed opposi-
tion that Molotov has ever encountered. The ﬁrst
and most important result will be renewed West-
ern solidarity. During the past years, rifts in
policy have develo ed, and it is a major Soviet
objective to widen them and to breach the Western
front. At Berlin the Western Foreign Ministers
closed ranks. Our European allies stood ﬁrm
with us, and we believe that the prospects for
European unity are increased by the unmasking
of the Soviet purposes.
When the main focus of East~West discussions
centered on the Orient, they touched an area. where
there remain some sharp divisions of policy among
the free nations and on which there are deep polit-
ical feelings, both in our own country and abroad.
The discussions in Berlin led to agreement on a
political conference to unite Korea. This had
een agreed on at the time of the armistice. The
terms of this conference are what we wanted.
The place and composition are recisely what we
have sought. No neutral will be present, and it
is expressly stipulated that no recognition of Com-
munist China is involved or implied. We were
already talking to the Chinese Communists, as
belligerents, at Panmunjom in an attempt to ro-
duce terms for the po itical discussions, w ere
we recognize their existence simply as the malev-
olent force that has been ﬁghting and trying to
destroy our own. We have no intention of chang-
ing this viewpoint.
Now, I would like to discuss Korea and Indo-
china with you. Perhaps I can clear up some mis-
understanding about the situation in the latter
area.
