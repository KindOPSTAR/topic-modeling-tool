Atlantic ﬂying. These include meteorological ob-
servations Wthh are needed for general weather
forecastin services in countries surrounding the
North At antic, observations useful to maritime
interests, and uarding of radio distress fre-
quencies for sur ace shipping. This concept had
always been rejected, however, and both the First
and Second Conferences led to a reements with
theoretical responsibilities relate solely to the
number of North Atlantic crossings by aircraft of
each participatin state.
At the Fourth onference the United States and
Canada again took the lead in urging tangible
recognition of the fact that weather movements
in the North Atlantic are generally from west to
east and that \Vestern Europe therefore receives
proportionately greater beneﬁts from the ocean
stations network than do North American states.
Some European delegations again opposed recog-
nition of nonaeronautical beneﬁts, but the major-
ity were prepared to modify their previous
position. It was ﬁnally agreed that beneﬁts de-
rived from the North Atlantic Ocean Stations
Program are approximately 80 percent aeronauti-
cal and 20 percent nonaeronautical. The ratio of
aggregate nonaeronautical beneﬁts under the
9-station program was set at 75 percent for Europe
to 25 percent for North America.
Spain urged that res onsibilities be calculated
on a reduced basis for ights across the southern
ortion of the North Atlantic, claiming that fewer
beneﬁts are derived from the Ocean Stations Pro-
gram in that sector. After considerable discus-
sion in the Technical Committee, the Conference
rejected this proposal as one which would unneces-
sarily complicate the already difﬁcult process of
calculating and assessing responsibilities.
The Conference drew u the following schedule
of theoretical responsibilities covering all par-
ticipating states and those whose aircraft were
deemed to receive beneﬁts from the network:
