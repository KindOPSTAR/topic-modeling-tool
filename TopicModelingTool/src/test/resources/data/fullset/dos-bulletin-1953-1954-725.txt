Karachi is ac owledged with great appreciation.
“The United States Government has been in-
formed that this gesture represents the desire of
the Government and the people of Pakistan to
give evidence of their deep ap reciation for emer-
gency wheat shipments, whic the United States
supplied to Pakistan. The wheat aid pro ram
was successfully completed recently with a ak-
istan Government announcement that no further
shipments were needed.
“The Department of State plans to avail itself
of Pakistan’s offer and will request, through the
appropriate channels, funds Wlth which to con-

will be warmly received in the United States.”
lmmlgratlon Into Israel
Press release 281 dated May 6
The Israeli Ambassador to the United States,
Abba Eban, called upon Assistant Secretary
Byroade on May 5 to rotest ofﬁcially certain re-
marks made by Mr. yroade in an address at
Philadelphia on May 1.‘
The Israeli protest centered around the portion
of that address on immigration into Israel.
Mr. Byroade ex lained to the Ambassador that
he had felt impe ed to speak frankly on what
seemed to be some of the underlying causes of the
Arab-Israeli dispute because it seemed to be in-
creasingly affecting the security of the Middle
East—and, hence, that of the United States. He
said he felt the American people were entitled to
such information, particularly in view of the new
evidence of Soviet intentions in the Middle East
which had not heretofore been highlighted for the
American people.
Mr. Eban was informed by Mr. Byroade that he
regretted the Israeli Government had interpreted
his remarks on the sub'ect of immigration as an
intervention in Israel’s internal affairs. It seemed
to him that the Israeli Government had overlooked
the basic point in that ortion of the speech, which
was that the Arab wor d does have a fear of Israeli
expansion at some future date to meet the needs
of an expanded citizenry. The fact that such a
fear existed reached the Department daily in its
many re orts from all over the Middle East and
was co ed by frequent ﬁrsthand observation in
the ﬁeld of visiting Department of State personnel.
Mr. Byroade pointed out that an analysis of his
speech would reveal that the course of action Israel
might choose to lay at rest this type of fear of the
Arabs was not speciﬁed; and he ho ed that serious
attention would still be given by t e Government

of Israel to ﬁnding a solution to the problem raised.
The address merely stated that assurances by the
Great Powers should be supplemented by Israel
herself ﬁnding some way to lay at rest this concern
of her neighbors and thus remove this s ecter of
fear—which he had said did not seem to im to be
based upon reality—from minds in the Middle
East. It called upon wise statesmanship to ﬁnd a
way of such accomplishment.
