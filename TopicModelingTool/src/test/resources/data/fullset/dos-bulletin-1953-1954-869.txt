In recognition of the fact that the sup ort and
maintenance of a large defense force Wll place a
strain upon the Turkish economy which it cannot
resently bear without external assistance and in
urther recognition of the fact that it is in our
common interest that Turkey be laced in a posi-
tion where it can su port the nee s of its military
establishment and its economy through its own
resources in the shortest possible time, the United
States Executive Branch has requested the Con-
gress for funds which would permit the furnishing
of economic assistance to Turkey during the com-
ing ﬁscal year.
Although it is impossible for the United States
Government to make any commitments as to its
intentions with respect to the furnishing of mili-
tary or economic support assistance be 0nd Fiscal
Year 1955, it has been agreed with the epublic of
Turkey to continue the appraisal of Turkey’s pos-
sible future needs and of the measures which may
have to be taken by the Government of Turkey
and the Government of the United States in the
attainment of their common objectives.
Eric Johnston To Resume Talks
on Jordan Valley Development
Press release 298 dated June 4
Ambassador Eric Johnston will leave for the
Near East on June 10 to resume conversations with
four Arab States and Israel regarding the develop-
ment of the Jordan River Valley.
Mr. Johnston will meet with representatives of
the Governments of Lebanon, S ria, Jordan, and
Egypt in Cairo on June 12. F o lowin these dis-
CliSSlOIlS he will proceed to Tel Aviv or similar
meetings with representatives of the Government
of Israel. .
Beth Israel and the interested Arab States have
given Ambassador Johnston their comments on the
road program for Jordan Valley development
roposed to them last November during Mr.
ohnston’s ﬁrst visit to the area as the personal
re resentative of President Eisenhower.
n addition, both the Arab States, acting as a
group, and Israel have now submitted detailed
engineering proposals of their own as to how the
valley’s water resources can be developed for irri-
gation and power. These proposals, together with
those originall put forward b Ambassador
Johnston, will orm the basis of t e forthcoming
discussions at Cairo and Tel Aviv. Both plans
represent considered study of the idea by experts
over a period of some months and indicate a posi-
tive and constructive attitude toward the basic
conception of comprehensive Valley development.
Juno I4, 1954
Ambassador J ohnston’s aim in the forthcomin
talks in the area will be to deﬁne points of essentia
agreement and, insofar as possible, to narrow the
differences on technical aspects of the irrigation
and power project.
The Valley development program contemplates
the construction of an integrated system of engi-
neering works calculated to irrigate about 250,000
acres of land and develo more than 60,000 kw. of
electricity for the bene t of the peoples of the
countries having an interest in the waters of the
Jordan basin. Among these would be a substan-
tial number of Arab refugees from Palestine who
have been on international relief rolls for about
6 years.
Mr. Johnston will be accompanied by staff ad-
visers from the Department of State and the F or-
eign Operations Administration.
