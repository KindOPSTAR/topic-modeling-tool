acceptance and understanding by other nations
of the prerequisites for the attraction of private
foreign investment. We shall continue to use the
treaty approach to establish common rules for the
fair treatment of foreign investment.
In connection with legislation authorizing the
mutual security program, I suggest that the Con-
gress consider the desirability of broadening the
existing authority to arantee against losses on
new investment abroa , so as to cover losses caused
by war, revolution, and insurrection.
The Commission has pointed out that uncer-
tainty as to the application of United States anti-
trust laws to the operations of American ﬁrms
abroad is a deterrent to foreign investment. It
recommended that our antitrust laws be restated
in a manner which would clearly acknowledge the
right of each country to regulate trade within its
own borders. At the same time, the Commission
insisted that it should be made clear that foreign
laws or established business practices which en-
courage restrictive rice, roduction, or marketin
arrangements will imit t e willingness of Uni
States businessmen to invest abroad and will re-
duce the beneﬁts of such investment to the
economies of the host countries.
I have requested the Department of Justice to
consider this recommendation in connection with
its current study of the antitrust laws.
Buy American Legislation
At resent certain of our laws require that, in
speci ed Federal or federally ﬁnanced procure-
ment, preference be given to domestic ﬁrms over
foreign bidders. Exce t where considerations of
national security, perSistent and substantial un-
employment, or encouragement of small business
require otherwise, I agree with the Commission
that it is im roper policy, unbusinesslike proce-
dure, and un air to the taxpayer for the Govern-
ment to pay a premium on its purchases.
I request, therefore, that legislative authority
be rovided to exem t from the provisions of this
legislation the bid ers from nations that treat
our bidders on an equal basis with their own na-
tionals. Meanwhile, the executive branch is
clarifying the application of these preference
rinci les to Government rocurement. It will
'mit t e price differential avoring domestic pro-
ducers over foreign bidders to a reasonable percent,
dependent upon the circumstances over and above
whatever tariﬂ's may apply. Discretionary au-
thority, however, must be continued to permit s e-
cial consideration in Government procurement or
the requirements of national security, for the
problems of small business, and of areas where
persistent and substantial unemployment exists.
Raw Materials
This country is blessed with abundant mineral
resources, but we must make the most of them if
we are to satisfy the ever-increasing appetite of
an expanding economy and at the same time main-
tain an adequate defense osture. We must rec-
ovnize, however, that it is not possible for this
Niition, or any other nation, to produce enough
of every metal and mineral needed by modern
industr . These materials are not evenly dis-
tribute throughout the world. We have to
de end on one another. Our forei economic
po icies, therefore, must encourage t e relatively
easy ﬂow of these materials in international trade.
The Commission has made two sets of recom-
mendations which I believe will materially assist
in achieving an orderl expansion of mineral
production both here an abroad.
The ﬁrst is that the United States Government
should make a constructive contribution toward
greater stability of world prices of raw materials
by moderating or relaxing impediments to inter-
national trade, by encouraging diversiﬁcation of
foreign economies, by avoiding procurement prac-
tices which disturb world prices, by consultation
with other nations, and by tempering the ﬂuctua-
tions in our own economy.
The second calls for increased encouragement of
investment in overseas production by our citizens
and the nationals of other countries.
I heartin endorse these recommendations.
The Commission also recommended that do-
mestic sources for raw materials required for mil-
itary purposes should be assured by direct means
and not by tariffs and im ort quotas. I believe
that normall this is sound).
However, have appointed a special Cabinet
committee which is now surveying the whole ﬁeld
of our minerals policy and have drawn their at-
tention to these recommendations.
Agriculture
Perhaps no sector of our economy has a greater
stake in foreign trade than American agriculture.
In recent years, for example, one-third of our
wheat, forty percent of our cotton and rice, and
one-fourth of our tobacco and soybeans have been
exported. It is highly important to maintain
foreign markets for our agricultural products.
Any program designed to serve the interests
of American agriculture must take due account
of the necessity for export markets. Put in the
words of the Commission, “It is necessary to har-
monize our agricultural and foreign economic
policies without sacriﬁcing the sound objectives
of either.” I am convinced such reconciliation is
possible. Acceptance of the recommendations in
my agricultural message of January 11 will, I
feel certain, help accomplish this objective.
Merchant Marine
With respect to our ocean shipping, we must
have a merchant marine adequate to our defense
