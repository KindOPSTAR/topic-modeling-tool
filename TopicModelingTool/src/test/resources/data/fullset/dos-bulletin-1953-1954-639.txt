The United States Government and the High Au-
thority in continuing negotiations will together
seek new means by which with the assistance of
the Government the mobilization of private capital
for such investments can be promoted.
The terms of the present loan have been incor-
orated in an agreement between the United States
(Eiovernment and the High Authority which has
been signed on A ril 23. This agreement provides
that the loan wil bear interest at 37/8 percent and
be repayable over a period of 25 years.
The proceeds will be used by the High Author-
ity to make loans to enter rises within the Com-
munity in order to assist in developing facilities
for the production of coal, coke and iron ore; pro-
viding additional housing for miners; and con-
structin and modernizing power stations at the
pit hea s to facilitate the economic use of low-
grade coal. The loans will go to projects which
are considered by the Hi h Authority to be consist-
ent with the operation oga common market within
the Community, free from national barriers and
private obstruction to competition.
The United States took the occasion of the nego—
tiations to advise the Hi h Authority that it is
consulting with some of t e member countries of
the Community on the lifting of quota restrictions
maintained by them on United States coal. Relp-
resentatives of the High Authority assured t
United States that the Community is committed to
the maintenance of a high level of trade with the
rest of the world for coal and steel and that the
removal of such quota restrictions on imports of
coal is not precluded by any provisions of the
Community’s treaty.
The occasion was also used to discuss the ros-
ects of maintaining and increasing competition
in the markets for coal and steel within the Com-
munity. It was recognized in the discussions that
considerable progress has been made in this direc-
tion over the past year.
TEXT OF REMARKS MADE AT
SIGNING CEREMONY
Press release 212 dated April 23
Walter B. Smith, Acting Secretary of State
This agreement we are signing today between
the United States Government and the High
Authority of the European Coal and Steel Com-
munity has historic signiﬁcance. In its broad
context this agreement affords concrete evidence
of our profound interest in the movement toward
European unity, which the President and the Con-
gress have so consistently supported as an essential
ingredient of our collective endeavors to attain
lasting security and peace. In an economic sense
the loan represents a sound business transaction
which should be mutually beneﬁcial to both parties.
It is our earnest hope that the European Coal
and Steel Community will successfull achieve its
objectives and thereby provide a soli foundation
for further progress toward unity in free Europe.
Jean Monnet, President of the High Authority
Mr. Secretary:
The agreement which today you have signed on
behalf of the United States Government with my
colleagues and myself, who are acting on behalf of
the European Coal and Steel Community, is an
event the signiﬁcance of which oes beyond even
the importance of the loan itsel? Indeed this is
the ﬁrst agreement—I will almost sa treaty——
signed between the Government of t e United
States and United Europe.
You know that the European Coal and Steel
Community is not coal and steel only, but is indeed
the beginning of the creation of Europe. In this
beginnin 51x countries of Europe: Bel ium,
France, %ermany. Italy, Luxembourg, an the
Netherlands, have joined in transferring part of
their traditional sovereignty to common institu-
tions. These institutions have authority over the
coal and steel resources of the six countries, and
the immediate responsibility to create a common
market without barriers or discriminations and to
establish the basis of a dynamic and expanding
economy.
We are not limiting this great enterprise to the
six countries alone; indeed any European country
that will accept the princi les, rules, and demo-
cratic institutions of the ommunity can join.
We have already, in the ﬁeld of coal and steel,
created the European common market of 160
million consumers. The ultimate object is to elim-
inate all the barriers that have existed between
European countries for so many centuries and to
do away with the oppositions that have been the
cause of the past wars. We are striving ﬁnally
to unite the people of Europe themselves.
The loan which your Government has granted
to the Community reﬂects in its commercial terms
the established credit of the High Authority and
the determination of your Government to continue
to support our eﬁorts in building this strong and
united Europe so essential to the preservation of
eace.
p In the name of my two colleagues, who will now
sign the agreement with me, and of the High
Authority wish to assure you and the Govern-
ment of t e United States, of our appreciation
for the support which you are giving us in this
great enterprise.
Heine Pottho/f, Member of the High Authority

contributing to their investments. These ne otia-
