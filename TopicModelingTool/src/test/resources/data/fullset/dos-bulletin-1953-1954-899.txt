its combat strength in Korea since the Armistice
Agreement came into force. On the contrary, the
Swedish and Swiss Members concluded, in their
evaluation on rotation of military personnel and
replacement of combat materiel for the months of
October-November 1953, that the United Nations
Command side had considerably reduced its over-
all combat strength during this period. The same
trend has prevailed in the following months. In
this connection it should be noted that, contrar
to the assertion of the Czechoslovak and Polis
Members, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Com-
mission as such has not submitted any evaluation
re ort for the months of October—November 1953.
he char e that the United Nations Command
side has vio ated the provisions of the Armistice
Agreement relating to the replacement of combat
materiel piece-for-piece of the same effectiveness
and of the same type is merely a product of the
imagination of the Czechoslovak and Polish Mem-
bers. Their way of reasoning may be illustrated
by a statement in the evaluation of rotation of
military personnel and replacement of combat
materiel which they submitted to the Military
Armistice Commission for the months of October—
November 1953. The statement relates to the re-
placement of training aircraft designated as T-33
which, besides, is no combat aircraft. The conten-
tion of the Czechoslovak and Polish Members is
that the United Nations Command side is violating
the provisions of the replacement piece-for- iece of
the same effectiveness and the same type y hav-
ing T—33’s replaced by T—33A’s. The absurdity
of this accusation appears from the fact that all
T-33’s in South Korea are T—33A’s. The Czecho-
slovak and Polish Members persist, however, in
yielding to the same misapptrehensions with re-
gard to other types of aircra .
In the ﬁrst period after the signing of the Ar-
mistice A cement the United Nations Command
side strict y reported types of combat aircraft as
required b the rovisions of the Armistice Agree-
ment. W en t e Neutral Nations Inspection
Teams started their control operations some three
weeks after the Armistice Agreement had been
si ed, they also conﬁned themselves to reporting
0 types only of combat aircraft. Subse uently
they extended their reportin to include sub-t pes
(models) as well, and the nited Nations om-
mand side, for its part, adopted the same proce-
dure, although there was no obligation to do so
under the provisions of the Armistice Agreement.
The assertion of the Czechoslovak and Polish
Members that “the United Nations Command side
still refuses to report the sub-types of combat air-
craft” is therefore completely unfounded. This
assertion seems to be based on their ignorance of
the deﬁnition of the word “sub-type” which, con-
trary to their belief, has nothing to do with vary-
ing serial numbers of aircraft.
Due to the fact that, in the beginning, types
only, and no sub-types, were reported either by
the United Nations Command or the Neutral Na-
tions Inspection Teams, some doubts have arisen
with regard to some replacement ﬁgures. The
Czechoslovak and Polish Members bluntly infer
for example, that the United Nations Command
side by 30 November 1953 had introduced four
more combat aircraft F—94 than it had shipped
out, and, in addition that F—94’s had been re-
placed b F—94B’s which they assumed to be an
improve version of the F —94. There are, how-
ever, two facts they omit to take into considera-
tion: (1) that before the Neutral Nations Inspec-
tion Teams started their control operations the
United Nations Command reported to have ﬂown
out nine F—94’s more than it had introduced and
thus even with due consideration for the ﬁgures
of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams had
built up a credit of six F—94’s by 30 November
1953 (one aircraft was missed in the counting of
the Czechoslovak and Polish Members) ; (2) that
there is no difference between the F—94 and the
F-94B and thus, in fact, all aircraft in this class
should be listed as F-94B. The conclusions of the
Czechoslovak and Polish Members are therefore
fallacious and completely misleadin .
The Czechoslovak and Polish Mgembers quote
the deﬁnition agreed upon b the Military Anni-
stice Commission with regar to “combat aircraft”
as referred to by the Armistice Agreement. The
deﬁnition, of 28 November 1953, reads as follows:
(1) Aircraft which are designed to expend destructive
ordnance and which, even though not equipped with
weapons at a given time, can have weapons installed in
them at any time; and (2) Aircraft designed for weather,
photography, and visual reconnaissance or tactical air
coordination.
The application of this deﬁnition on aircraft
in the territory under the military control of the
United Nations Command—as is well known not a
single aircraft has been reported as incoming or
outgoin in the territor under the milita con-
trol of t e Korean Peo e’s Army and the C inese
People’s Volunteers— as met with little diﬂi-
cultles as far as the Neutral Nations Inspection
Teams are concerned. They were an way in a
position to check on all incoming an outgoing
aircraft, both combat and non-combat, and as a
matter of routine the reported to the Neutral
Nations Supervisory ommission, long before the
deﬁnition of combat aircraft was given, all train-
ing aircraft that came within the range of their
observations. N o instructions to that effect had,
however, been issued.
The United Nations Command side, for its part,
never considered training aircraft to be combat
aircraft and therefore did not list them in the re-
ports which, under para. 13 of the Armistice
Agreement, the sides have to submit daily to the
Military Armistice Commission and to the Neu-
tral Nations Supervisory Commission. The
Swedish Member, although convinced personally
that training aircraft could not be considered as
