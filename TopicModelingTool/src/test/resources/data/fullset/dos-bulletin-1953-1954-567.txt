duction, to stimulate industry, and to increase
India’s foreign trade.
While rogress has been made, there is a great
distance eft to travel. If the present economic
program is successful, all well and good. If, how-
ever, the disruptive forces within the country gain
strength and totalitarian eﬁ'orts meet with in-
creasmg local successes, the countries of the free
world will have cause for alarm.
This brings me to the heart of our feelings
toward India. Re rdless of our differences on
foreign policy an security matters, what the
United States is most interested in is a free, inde-
pendent India following the route of her own
choosing. It would be a major disaster if the
freedom of India’s Government and people were
taken awa —a disaster from which the rest of the
free worldy might never recover.
On our part, there are no hidden reservations or
limitations on our relationship with India. We
stand ready, as in the ast, to help India where we
can and in ways that s e may desire. We shall do
everythin in our power to insure that our rela-
tions pro uce nothing but friendshi and mutual
beneﬁt. We are conﬁdent that this is India’s de-
sire as well.
You will remember that the United States has
lon given aid and encouragement to India. As
far ack before Indian independence as 1941, the
two countries exchanged representatives. In
1942, Col. Louis Johnson, President Roosevelt’s
personal representative with the rank of Ambassa-
dor, participated in the unsuccessful efforts to
work out agreement between the British and In-
dians on India’s political future.
Subsequentl , the United States made its views
known to the ritish Government concerning its
su ort of ste s which might be taken toward
full llment of ndian nationalist as irations.
At the same time, we made great e orts through
the exchange of information, exchange of persons
and other formulas to insure that America an
our way of life be known to the eople of India.
We welcomed wholehearte y the measures
taken toward real independence, the establishment
in 1946 of an Interim Government and a Con-
stituent Assembly to draft a constitution.
In October 1946 the two nations exchanged
ambassadors.
Following partition in August 1947 and as India
be an to exercise the rights and responsibilities of
independence, the United States increasin 1y wel-
comed her active role in world affairs. I e have
been, for instance, happy to see the active part
she has played in the work of the United Nations
and its specialized agencies—although we have not
at all times agreed with her position.
We have, further, taken a strong interest in the
tremendous economic problems which face India.
The average life expectancy is 32 years. About
75 million each year suffer the debilitating and
often fatal effects of malaria. She has a popula-
tion density of 308 per slquare mile compared to 54
in the United States. er population is increas-
ing at the rate of 5 million a year. Her crop yields
are desperately low. Famine is an ever-present
danger.
U.S. Md
To help avert a desperate grain shortage in 1951,
the U.S. Con ess loaned India $190 million to
purchase 2 mi lion tons of wheat.
Since 1951, our programs of technical assistance
and special economic aid have been directed to
supplementing the extraordinary steps being taken
by the Indian Government throu h its Five Year
Plan to raise the living standar s of its people.
In 1952, our programs amounted to almost $53
million; in 1953, to $44,300,000; and in the present
ﬁscal year, to $89 million. Altogether, in grants
and loans, the U.S. Government has made about
$390 million available to India. We expect to
continue this assistance.
Under it, the United States is providin techni-
cal advice to India’s Commumt Deve opment
Program which is reaching 14 million people in
22,000 villages. Indian leaders and technicians
numberin in the hundreds have been brought to
the Unite States for specialized training. Sup-
plies and eq i ment are being rovided farmers
who cannot a 0rd to purchase t cm.
In addition, our funds are being used for direct
assistance in economic development, industrial as
well as agricultural.
Private American foundations are also playing
an important part in these efforts. The Ford and
Rockefeller Foundations are actively involved in
helping improve living standards.
Thus, many, mang Americans today are work-
ing daily side b si e with Indians in the funda-
mental tasks 0 improving the lives of India’s
millions.
American private investment in India is sub-
stantial and contributes to a sounder Indian econ-
omy. Within the past ear, for instance, we have
seen a multimillion do lar oil reﬁnery started in
Bombay by an American company.
India, in turn, has much to offer us economically.
From India, we purchase large amounts of im-
portant industrial materials, including mica and
manganese. We also buy ilmenite, the ore used
in making titanium, and kyanite, used in manu-
facturing refractory bricks.
Outside the economic ﬁeld, we ﬁnd the ties of
friendship being strengthened in other ways. A
host of India’s students and teachers and many
of ours are continually being exchanged. These
boys and girls and men and women, through the
experience of daily living with their hosts, con-
tribute greatly to good will.
India has a. great cultural and spiritual heritage
on which we can draw. As our two countries know
