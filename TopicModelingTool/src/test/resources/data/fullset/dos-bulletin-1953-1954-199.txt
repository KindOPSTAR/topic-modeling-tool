about 800 groups in the United States are taking
a direct part in the information program. They
help to carry out the objectives of the information
program in a variety of ways overseas.
But more help is needed to tell the story of
freedom.
The Junior Chamber of Commerce is in the fore-
front of this ﬁght, at home and abroad.
The 140,000 Jaycees living in 2,000 American
communities can recall and can report on many
projects of aid, such as their assistance in improv-
ing conditions in their communities. in ublic
health, and in creating the teen-age “Road- -O,”
dedicated to promoting safe driving habits among
our young people; also your campai s on behalf
of national security and your activities in support
of our religious institutions.
In support of the need for international under-
standing, your organization and the Junior
Chamber International are cooperating with the
Information Agency in organizmg a major letter-
writing program. This will bring more than
5,500 youn executives in other lands in direct
contact wit you. It will create an exchange of
ideas and an atmosphere of mutual understand-
ing on a person-to-person basis. This activity is
among those essential to reach other peoples.
Scope of Soviet Propaganda
Look further, for a moment, at Soviet propa-
ganda directed to the world and at its immensi-
ties.
Propaganda is the chief weapon of the U.S.S.R.
The incidents of war and the threat of war always
steal the headlines, but the incidents of propa-
ggpda, by the Soviets, are unceasing and uncount-
a e.
Every year the Soviet Union and the satellite
nations are spending one and one-half billion dol-
lars on propaganda. This does not include the
monies spent by the local Communist parties and
Communist front organizations in free countries
as well as in their own.
To perpetuate and to man these efforts, the
Soviets have in operation a propaganda schooling
system with a constant enrollment of more than
300,000 persons. They maintain some 6,000 local
schools and 177 regional schools for higher train-
in in propaganda.
This system produces a. trained corps of Com-
munist specialists; it is really an army of propa-
gandists. And they train agents in t is satellites
and Red China and in the free countries. In fact,
the team of North Koreans in Panmunjom, with
whom Ambassador Arthur Dean negotiated, were
graduates of Russian propaganda schools.
Korea, however, has provided the most pro-
nounced refusal of communism by its own eople.
In Korea, two-thirds of the captured ‘volun-
teers” from China, who had been serving with the
North Koreans, have turned down repatriation to
their homeland. The total ratio was about 600 to 1
in favor of the free world. For 22,000 Communist
POW’s have refused repatriation, while only 360
U.Nfdsoldiers have turned their backs on the free
wor .
Elsewhere, 300,000 inhabitants of Soviet-con-
trolled East Germany risked their lives in 1953
to esca to freedom in West Germany. One of
every ve Germans in West Germany today is a
refugee or dis laced person, and that s 20 percent
of 47 million ermans !
Recently one young Polish lieutenant—an honor
graduate of Communist schools, a leader in Com-
munist youth organizations, a res ected member
of the Communist Party—landed hlS Russian-built
jet ﬁghter in Munich. He too had escaped to free-
dom. Speaking to the press about his homeland,
Lieutenant J arecki said:
Today in Poland, the degradation of the individual is
commonplace. The Communist Party seeks to carry out
its program through a terrible perversion of the truth.
This method of political education has long since con-
vinced me that a system built on hatred for everything not
Communist, a system founded on violence, is basically an
evil system. . . . That is why I decided to ﬂee Poland
and gain an opportunity to speak as a free man.
His was a dramatic ﬂi ht, but he was just an-
other refugee. Hundre s are slipping through
the Iron Curtain daily in spite of guarded efforts
to hold them inside their Communist prison. They
come by foot, by truck, by auto, by locomotive.
One enterprising Czech ﬂed to the West in a home-
made armored car in which he had managed to
conceal his family of ﬁve.
This, too, is a denial of communism, and it will
continue to grow.
Today the greatest offensive of the vast Soviet
propaganda armada is directed against the unity
of t e free world. Eve weapon in their arsenal
of propaganda is aime at the coalition of free
nations.
They want to defeat the European Defense Com-
munity. They want to undermine NATO. They
want to sabotage the Schuman Plan. The want
to separate France from the Western a liance.
They want to sow discord between France and Ger-
many, and between the United States and Britain.
Their purpose is to fragment the world. They
play on t e nationalistic spirit of sovereign peoples
in Europe, Asia, and Latin America in order to
divide us from our allies. They want to destroy
the cooperation so carefully developed—coopera-
tion which allows us to help protect our common
interests.
Here lies our major challenge. Here must come
our greatest effort 1n the information ﬁeld. Unite
the free world, and let the cold war last as long
as it may, and we would win it. But see the free
world fall apart, and we lose the struggle.
In this struggle, the youth of the free world
must play their most important role. Youth in
the free nations must see to it that every possible
bond of unity is forged. Youth in the free nations
