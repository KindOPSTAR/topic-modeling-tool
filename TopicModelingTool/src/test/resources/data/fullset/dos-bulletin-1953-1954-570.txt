is no basis for appreiiension over the possibility
of contaminated tuna from Japan. I am informed

the Japanese tuna industry has for some time

charge of the atients, they have established the
presumption t at the radioactive constituents of
the ash which fell on the Fukuryu Maru have not
been deposited in signiﬁcant amounts in the tis-
sues of the hospitalized ﬁshermen. Immediately
upon his arrival in Japan Mr. Eisenbud discussed
the subject in detail with Japanese investigators
and urged that the question be removed from the
realm of speculation by radio chemical analysis
of the urine of the ﬁshermen. This technique,
facilities for which did not exist in Japan, per-
mits a quantitative evaluation of the extent to
which intratissue deposits of radio-chemicals have
occurred. Mr. Eisenbud oﬁ'ered to undertake this
analysis for all of the 23 (patients. Two speci-
mens of urine were submitte to Mr. Eisenbud who
arranged for them to be ﬂown to the United
States for immediate analysis. Five subsequent
sam les have been received and are now bein
ana yzed in the United States. Their results wil
be romptly communicated. The results of the
analyses which have been completed have already
been reported to Dr. Kobayashi. It has been de-

The National Council on Naturalization and
Citizenship, I understand, is primarily concerned
with the problems of the immigrant who wishes
to integrate into the American community and
to become a citizen of the United States. From
this point of view the members of the Council
will be interested in certain changes which the
Immigration and Nationality Act2 has brought
about in the immigration ﬁeld and which will be

termined that the excretion of the radio-chemicals
is of such a low order as to assure that the deposits
of radio-isotopes in the tissues of these two patients
give no medical basis for concern.
This, of course, applies only to the possibility,
originally raised, that radioactive materials in the
tissue of the men would produce injury in the
years to come. There remains the injury pro-
duced b external radiation from the ash. I un-
derstan that the ﬁshermen are now convalescing
from the effects of this initial injury. The
American specialists have not been able to make
appropriate suggestions for action including ther-

I have informed the Japanese Government that

The Immigration and Nationality Act, which
was enacted on June 27, 1952, has now been in
operation for more than 15 months. Almost un~
noticed by the general public, this act has brought
about a number of chan s which have roven
beneﬁcial to those who wis i to come to the nited
States and have in many ways facilitated the ad-
ministration of the law.
Before I discuss with you some of these changes,
let me remind you that the basic concepts of the
Immigration and Nationality Act are not differ-

can immigration policy ever since there has been
