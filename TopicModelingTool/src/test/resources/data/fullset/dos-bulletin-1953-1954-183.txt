traordinary” expenditures abroad are connected
with our defense effort, and that the “'estern
European countries’ own defense rograms affect
adversely their trade osition, by increasing their
essential imports and y absorbing resources that
would otherwise be available for expanding their
ex orts.
urveying the postwar experience as a whole,
the Commission believes, as already stated, that
much remains to be done to achieve a de endable
international balance. It believes that t 1e prob-
lem must be attacked on man fronts and that too
much dependence should not laced on any one
line of attack. There is no sing e or simple solu-
tion. The ﬁnal solution will probably depend
even more upon the efforts of other countries than
upon our own. It will involve their continuing
internal efforts to achieve sound and strong econ-
omies and their external efforts to correct their
international imbalance.
This report, however, is primarily concerned
with the steps that this country can take toward
solving the world’s dollar problem, steps that will
be consistent with our own political, economic,
and security interests. Or, to employ the lan-
guage of the statute under which this Commis-
sion was organized, this report must deal with the
enlargement of international trade in a manner
consistent with a sound domestic economy.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Foreign‘Ald and Technical Assistance
ECONOMIC AND MILITARY AIO
The Commission recommends that economic aid
on a grant basis should be terminated as soon as
possible.
For the military purpose of offshore procure-
ment to be served effectively, the Commission
recommends that contracts for the roduction of
military equi ment be placed abroa on the basis
of the consi erations of cost availability, and
quality of the items purchased that overn e ective
procurement policy at home, or on road strategic
]ud ents concerning the character and location
of t e military production base on which the suc-
cess of the joint defense eﬁ'ort depends. The off-
shore procurement program should not be used as
a form of general economic aid.
The Commission recommends further that
where support is needed to maintain military
forces or to conduct military operations connected
with our own security beyond the economic ca-
pacity of a country to sustain, grants should be
made, not loans.
In other cases where substantial economic aid
is necessary in the interest of the United States
but cannot be obtained from private or interna-
tional sources, loans should be made, not grants.
TIONNICAL ASSISTANCI
The Commission recommends that within the
limits imposed by congressional appropriations,
the need for selectin only sound prOJects, the
availability of traine technicians, and good ad-
ministration, the technical cooperation program
be pressed forward vigorously. It need not and
should not become a bi money” program and
should not involve capita investments.
The Commission also recommends that the
United States continue its support of the United
Nations Expanded Technical Assistance Program
and the small program of the Organization of
American States, through which the technical
skills of many countries can be better mobilized
and some dependent area and regional problems
can be more effectively approached than through
bilateral programs.
Unlted States Foreign Investment
TN! CONDITIONS CONDUCIV! TO PRIVATE
INVBTMINT Am“
The Government can and should give full diplo-
matic support to the acceptance and understand-
ing abroad of the principles underlying the
creation of a climate conducive to private foreign
investment.
The United States Government should continue
to use the treaty approach to establish common
rules on the fair treatment of foreign investment.
United States antitrust policies should be re-
stated in a manner which would clearly acknowl-
edge the right of each country to regulate trade
within its own borders. At the same time it
should be made clear that foreign laws or estab-
lished business practices which encourage restric-
tive price, production, or marketing arrangements
will limit the willingness of United States busi-
nessmen to invest abroad and will reduce the bene-
ﬁts of investment from abroad to the economies
of the host countries.
The United States Government should make
clear that primary reliance must be placed on
rivate investment to undertake the '0b of assist-
in in economic develo ment abroa . It should
pomt out that United tates resources for public
oans are limited and inadequate in relation to
total investment needs, and that public lending
or other forms of public ﬁnancing will not be a
substitute for private investment.
