which he desires protection, which would enerally
make acquisition of protection on a broarf basis an
im ractical proposition.
t is fortunate for those Americans interested
in copyright rotection abroad that nearl 40
countries of t e free world are members 0 the
Bern convention of 1886. The United States has
not been able to join the Bern convention because
some of its basic provisions are incom atible with
the United States legal concepts 0 copyright.
Americans have been able to enjoy the multilateral
protection of the Bern convention by entering
what is called the “side door” of the convention.
To illustrate, an American publisher can get pro-
tection for a new book in all Bern countries by
issuing it in London or Toronto at the same time
he does so in New York. In effect the book gets
protection as a British or Canadian work.
_ However, there is widespread fear among cop -
right circles in this country that, if our copyright
re ationships are not strengthened, this side door
will be closed to American authors. Indeed, r0-
visions of this convention permitting its mem ers
to limit or deny convention protection to nationals
of nonconvention countries have recently been
strengthened. It is the Department’s belief that
the reason no action has so far been taken under
these provisions is the pendency of the new Uni-
versal Copyright Convention.
In addition to the uncertain status of this side
door approach to protection in most of the major
countries, there are other respects in which our
copyright relations are unsatisfactory. There
are many countries in which we desire protection,
which are not members of Bern and which under
their law grant comparatively little protection to
foreign works. Many of these countries are un-
derdeveloped ones which feel a need for making
available to their nationals in their native tongues
foreign writings and culture. Special provisions
have been included in the Universal Copyright
Convention to meet this problem and to encourage
the adherence of such countries. It is to be noted,
as the Secretary of State pointed out in his report
on the convention,2 that some of these free-world
countries are in areas of the world bordering on
the Soviet bloc in which Communist propaganda
has its greatest impact. Improving our copyright
relations with such countries would be of signiﬁ—
cant importance as a means of stimulating the
ﬂow of books and other educational media to
them from the rest of the free world.
In the light of this situation, it can be fully
appreciated why there has been such strong sup-
port in the United States for a multilateral con-
vention in which the United States could partici-
pate, which would cement our relations in this
ﬁeld with the rest of the free world.

Development of the Conventlon
The development of the Universal Convention
began shortly after the war. It is the result of
careful and thorough preparatory work. From
1947 to 1951 a series of experts meetings was held
to shape the broad outlines of the convention. The
people who participated in this preparato work
were outstandin co yright specialists rom a
number of countries, rawn largely from the legal
profession. In the United States, this repara-
for?’ work was closely coordinated with t is copy—
rig it bar and other representatives of interested
groups as well as committees of the various bar
associations.
Finally, after extensive consultations with gov-
ernments, a draft was laid before the intergovern-
mental negotiating conference held at Geneva in
the summer of 1952, which adopted the ﬁnal docu-
ment as transmitted by the President to the Senate
for its advice and consent to ratiﬁcation. Many
of the same specialists who had participated in the
development work accompanied governmental rep-
resentatives as members of delegations to this con-
ference. The United States delegation was
honored in having present in addition Represent-
ative Crumpacker and the former chairman of
your subcommittee, the late Mr. Bryson. Fifty
countries were present at the conference and 40
have si ned the convention. Incidentally, no
Soviet b 0c country attended the conference or has
shown any interest in adherin to the convention.
I should like at this point to su mit for the record
the list of the countries which have signed the
convention.8
Largely as a result of the thoroughness and care
with which it was drafted, this instrument is a
realistic, effective and relatively simple means of
eliminating the unsatisfactory conditions which
presently prevail and of increasing the scope and
effectiveness of our international copyright rela-
tions. Basically the convention rovides for the
granting of national treatment. rom the stand-
point 0 the United States author, it would pro-
vide him with a permanent and secure basis for
foreign copyright protection and a siilnlple pro-
cedure for attaining this protection. e would
receive a hi her standard of protection than is
resently a orded under the laws of some of the
ess developed countries in such matters as the
number of years of protection and the conditions
under which translations of his work are made
into local language. He would be freed of the for-
'mal requirements which burden him under the
bilateral system. When his work was published

'Followlng are the signatories to the convention:
Andorra, Argentina. Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil,
Canada, Chile, Cuba, Denmark, El Salvador, Finland,
France. Germany, Guatemala, Haiti, Holy See, Honduras,
India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liberia, Luxembourg,
Mexico, Monaco, Netherlands, Nicaragua, Norway, Peru,
Portugal, San Marlno, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United
Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, and Yugoslavia.
