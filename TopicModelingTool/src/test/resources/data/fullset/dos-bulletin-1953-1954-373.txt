1'1“) June 30, 1953.
Short of another world war, with its attendant
emotional inﬂuences, it cannot be expected that
the American people will contribute funds and
goods as freely as they have in the ast. Never-
theless there is still a 10b to be done y the volun-
tary agencies on a selective rather than a general
basis. Collectively they are representative of the
interests of the ublic and, through registration,
they have estabhshed their responsibility through
years of collaboration with the Government.
pattern of organization has been developed ade-
quate for participation in services of relief, re-
habilitation, technical assistance, and self‘help.
To this end cooperation has been established b the
agencies, shared by their constituencies, our ‘ov-
ernment, and the governments of the participating
countries and thelr local social services. Such in-
tegration of operations assures the productive use
abroad of the contributions of the public at home.
The task of the Advisory Committee on Voluntary
Foreign Aid, of the American Council of Volun-
tary gencies for Foreign Service, and of the reg-
istered agencies, has been to assure this integration.
The transfer of the Advisory Committee to the
newly organized Foreign O erations Administra-
tion was in furtherance o the President’s plan
centralizing foreign assistance and related eco-
nomic responsibilities.“ At the time of the trans-
fer Secretary Dulles addressed a letter of July 1,
1953, to Charles P. Taft, Chairman of the Com-
mittee, expressing his thanks for the Committee’s
services during the 7 years of collaboration with
the Department of State. This Committee of hon-
orary advisers, he noted, was appointed by the
Secretary of State in 1946 at the request of the
President to correlate the programs of private and
voluntary agencies in the ﬁeld of foreign aid with
those of the Government. No one could foresee,
Mr. Dulles added, that the need for this form of
service would continue for so many years follow-
ing the end of the active war. It is in recognition
of this fact, the Secretary concluded, that the re-

organization rovides for the Committee to take
its place wit other a encies that have been
brought together in the ‘oreign O erations Ad-
ministration to further American umanitarian
services overseas.
