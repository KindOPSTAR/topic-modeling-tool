Union—a condition with consequences of disas-
trous weight for the future of the presently free
world.
I would like to speak to you about both parts
of that address, retros ctively about why we
made A-bombs, why we ecided to make H-bombs,
and, if the time permits, about what, in my humble
judgment, lies ahead. It is an extensive catalog,
and I know that I can only treat each part brieﬂy.
Genesle of Prealdent'a Plan
To begin with, we in the United States under-
took to make the atomic bomb because we had
good reason to believe that the Germans were
workin on it. It was clear that we had no re-
course ut to see that we were not outstripped in
armament, especially by a nation as irresponsibly
and belligerently led as Hitler Germany. After
we made the bomb, we used it. We used it to
bring the war with Japan to an abrupt close and
then rested on our military and scientiﬁc
achievements.
The next ste ur offer to share our monopoly
with the worl —despite its lack of success was
one of the most satisfactory and proud pages of
American history. It was satisfactory because its
motivation was altogether meritorious. The blame
for our failure to exorcise this blight on the lives
of our generation must be placed by history
3 uarely where it belongs, on the heads and hands
of the men in the Kremlin. In cynical but effec-
tive fashion, they used every diplomatic stratagem
to delay, confuse, and destroy the proposal. In
this they succeeded. It now appears that it may
well have been because they had atomic weapon
plans of their own.
The failure, therefore, of the Baruch pro osals
left the United States with no alternative ut to
press forward with the development of its atomic
arsenal, and this too was done.
The Soviet achievement of atomic weapon ca a-
bility eventuated sooner than most had expecte —
much sooner. Our intelligence arrangements,
fortunately inaugurated in time, enabled us to
know almost as quickly as the Russian high com-
mand and months before the Russian people
learned that a test had been made. We announced
it on September 23, 1949.s
The Soviets conducted further tests in the au-
tumn of 1951 and again last summer. That last
series began with a very large explosion in which
we were able to say that a thermonuclear reaction
had occurred, that is, the fusion of nuclei of light
elements.
I have already referred to the cataclysmic pos-
sible consequences of this test had we been unread
for its impact. Fortunately, we were prepare .

bomb capability was demonstrated in 1949 and

with negotiations for international control and
ins ection deadlocked by them, President Truman
too a decision. He was aware that a lead in
numbers of weapons—a quantitative superiority
which we believed that we then enjoyed—even if
we were sure that we could hold it would become
of less and less importance relatively until it was
meaningless. Our only hope was to maintain the
status quo by havin a qualitative superiority.
The President gave t e order to the Commission
on Januar 31, 1950, to proceed with work on
what was then generally called the “super” bomb
that is to say, a weapon em loying as its chief
source of energy the princip e of nuclear fusion
rather than of nuclear ﬁssion.
The success of American scientists and engineers
in this new effort is b now well known, and we
have no less an authority than Sir Winston
Churchill for the considered 0 inion that it has
been our continued possession o wea on su erior-
ity which has preserved the world 0m urther
large-scale aggression and another bath of blood.
Imagine the condition if we did not possess re-
taliatory power which neutralized the great Soviet
manpower plus their atomic wea on potential.
With that ower possessed or usablelby them alone,
they coul exert authority over small adjacent
nations with the whole world eventually ending
up in the maw of communism and slavery.
The alternative, however, of “two atomic co-
lossi . . . doomed malevolently to e e each other
indeﬁnitely across a tremblin worl ,” which Was
the vivid metaphor used by the President, is like-
wise an unacceptable condition thou h to a far
less degree than the consequence of su mission to
communism. Because it represents an instability
which could be triggered into a war of great de-
struction, President Eisenhower had given the
subject long and concerned thought.
Out of his deliberations came the conviction that
a new factor, a new dimension, would have to be
emphasized before an hope could be entertained.
The answer lay in t atom itself, in its latent
power to become not the master and destroyer but
the servant of man.
This was the genesis of the President’s proposal
and its ﬁrst great virtue is that it can be under-
taken “without the irritations and mutual sus-
picions incident to any attempt to set up a com-
pletely acceptable system of world-wide inspection
and control.”
You will recall the heart of his proposal was
that the governments rincipally concerned to the
extent permitted by elementary prudence should
begin now and continue to make joint contribu-
tions from their stockpiles of normal uranium and
ﬁssionable materials to an International Atomic
Ener 1 Agency. He envisaged that agency as
established under the aegis of the United Nations.
Such details as the ratio of contributions, the pro-
cedures, etc., he felt should be discussed in “private
conversations” between the contracting parties.
