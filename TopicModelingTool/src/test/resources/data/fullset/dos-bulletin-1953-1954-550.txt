“Not One of Us Alone"
A MUTUAL SECURITY PROGRAM FOR 1955
Statement by Secretary Dulles1
I welcome this 0 portunity to testify in sup-
port of the mutualpsecurit program for ﬁscal
year 1955. I shall deal wit the relation of that
program to our overall foreign policies. Other
aspects will be dealt with by 0t er witnesses. This
pro am is desi ned to promote the security and
we] are of the nited States. It takes account of
four basic facts:
1. The Soviet and Chinese Communist rulers
continue to build a vast military establishment
to serve their goal of world domination.
2. The United States cannot gain security in
isolation, but only through a system of collective
security.
3. Certain free-world countries cannot, without
our help, maintain the military posture required
in the common interest, including the interest of
the United States.
4. The threat we face is neither a short-term
threat nor is it exclusively a military threat.
Therefore, we should strive to hold free-world se-
curity commitments to levels which are compatible
with the economic and social health of ourselves
and our allies.
These basic principles derive from the ast and
are applicable to the future. Of course, c anging
conditions call for changing applications. I shal ,
in this presentation, primarily deal with those
features of next year’s program which reﬂect
change.
Deterrent Strategy
During the past year our strategy has been de-
veloped with a view to lacing greater emphasis
upon deterrent power. 1; is not practical to meet
in kind the vast land ower of the Soviet bloc
which, from its central urasian land mass, could

strike out in any one of many directions against
any one of more than 20 free nations. To attempt
to match that kind of power at every vital point
where it might attack would mean bankruptcy
and the exposure of many countries to ca ture
from within by Communist inﬁltrations. hus,
while the need of localized land strength is by no
means ignored, there has been an intensiﬁed search
for effective and less costly ways to deter attack.
We have felt that potential aggressors would
hesitate to attack if they felt that they would be
made to suffer more for their aggression than they
could gain by their aggression. That realization
can be created if the free world has diversity and
ﬂexibility of retaliatory power. We must not feel
bound always to give the aggressors the choice of
place and means. We must have a choice of our
own. That choice would follow a judgment as to
what would hurt the aggressor beyond his possi-
bility of gain and, at the same time, not enlarge
the conﬂict to our disadvantage.
The free nations can gain that power to choose,
and consequently to deter, if they create a wide-
spread community system in which defensive
strength is reinforced by mobile power which has
many points on which it can be based. This is
not on y effective but relatively economical for
then the power that protects one can quickly be
made available to protect many.
NATO
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which
yesterda celebrated its ﬁfth birthday, prowdes
the facilities needed to im lement deterrent poli-
cies. It does not ne lect efensive strength. But
it powerfully supp ements this by an extensive
system of bases and facilities, shared in common,
which extend from Canada through the North At-
lantic to Europe and into Asia.
Also the NATO Ministerial Council, which nor-
mally meets twice a year, assures indispensable
consultation on an authoritative basis.
