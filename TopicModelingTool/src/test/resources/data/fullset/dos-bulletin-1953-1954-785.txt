Gott'wald had been intercepted by naval forces .
of the Government of the Republic of China. As
in the case of the Polish tanker Pmoa 1 which was
Similarly intercepted in October 1953, the Polish
Government sought to impose upon the U.S. Gov-
ernment responsibility for the action against the
Gottwald. On May 20 this Government replied
to the Polish note through our Embassy in
lVarsaw. The substantive portion of our note is
as follows:
_“The U.S. Government rejects as com letely
Without foundation the allegations made y the
Polish Government. The United States Govern-
ment has had no connection whatever with this
incident.
“Furthermore, as has been clearly stated before,
and as the Polish Government must be well aware,
Eropaganda charges involving the United States
f (liverpment in the Praca case are also completely
a se.
East German Escapees
Increase in Number
A sharp rise—upward of 40 percent—in the
number of East Germans who risked their lives
to seek refuge in the \Vest occurred during the ﬁrst
month of the Soviet-established “free and sover-
eign regime” in East Germany, the U.S. Informa-
tion Agency announced on May 17.
In a recent dispatch to overseas posts, based on
reports from Germany, the Agency said that more
than 17,600 escapees from the Soviet Zone safely
made their way to refugee camps in West Berlin
and West Germany during April, an increase of
5,000 over March. This seemingly belies Red
propaganda claims of the freedom, security, and
contentment that exist in the so-called new East
German “sovereign” state, the I n f o r m a t i o n
Agency observed. '
Escapees in the ﬁrst 4 months of this year totaled
over 44,000, including 1,100 people’s police and
77 former commissars, the dispatch continued.
Nearly 1% million residents of the Soviet Zone
have sought political asylum in lVest Germany
during the last 5 years, including 300,000 in 1953.
Nearly half of the recent refugees are under 25
years of age, the Agency noted. German reports
suggest that this may be due, in part, to stepped-
up people’s police recruitment and the difﬁculty
of ﬁnding adequate jobs. Teachers, arriving in
growing numbers in \Vest Germany from the
Soviet Zone, anticipate a much larger inﬂux of
their colleagues, now that education in East Ger-
many is wholly governed by political considera-
tions.

‘ BULLETIN of Nov. 9, 1953, p. 640.
In an effort to halt this exodus from the East,
the people’s police are tightening border controls.
Reports indicate that during the ﬁrst 3 months of
this year 17 persons were shot and more than 2,600
arrested while trying to cross the border.
Ever tightening border controls are being im-
posed along the German-Polish border to prevent
the escape of Poles into East Germany and thence
to West Berlin. The entire border, from the Baltic
Sea to the Sudeten Mountains, is sealed oil by an
almost continuous high barbed wire fence, with
powerful searchlights closely spaced. In certain
areas, special devices such as acoustic signals and
ﬂares set off by hidden wires are used. Soviet
crews have recently replaced Poles in the manning
of Polish patrol boats along the Oder River
border.
