can Railway Congresses sponsored by the Associa-
tion and also was the ﬁrst to be held in this or any
other English speakinv country. The VIII
Congress was organized3 by the United States
Government and the U.S. National Commission
in the Pan American Railway Congress Associa-
tion, in collaboration with the Permanent Com-
mission of Panes.“ It was larger than an pre-
ceding Congress in the series 1n point 0 total
registration and number of countries represented
and was outstanding amon these Congresses in
scope and character of technical papers presented.
During the section and plenary sessions of the
Congress, held in Washington June 12-21, 1953, a
total of 168 pa rs from authors in 16 countries
were considere . These papers covered a wide
range of transportation subJects, including prob-
lems having to do with roadway and structures;
freight and passenger cars and locomotives; oper-
ation of servwe; accounting, statistics, and tariffs;
legislation, administration, and coordination; and
personnel and general subjects. A wealth of tech-
nical informatlon from authoritative sources was
thereby made available to the a ncies and indi-
viduals concerned with the esta lishment, opera-
tion, improvement, and administration of railway
transportation facilities.
Potential] more valuable than the assembly of
that body 0 information in respect to the future
development of railways was the stimulating effect
that the whole rocess had u on the minds of in-
terested indivi£1als before, uring, and after the
Congress. Of special signiﬁcance were the scope
and the results of the exchange of ideas and in-
formation attendant upon the pre-Congress prep-
aration and review of the various papers; the
during-the-Congress presentation, discussion, and
evaluation of the papers; and the post-Congress
distribution of the papers.
Equally important were the effects upon the
Congress participants of the proceedings at Atlan-
tic City, New Jersey, June 21—25, 1953. There
they were afforded an opportunity not only to
attend meetings of the Association of American
Railroads and the American Short Line Railroad
Association but also to inspect a $20 million exhi-
bition of railway rolling stock, equipment, and
appliances brought together by member ﬁrms of
the Railway Supply Manufacturers’ Association.
Two events of particular signiﬁcance to the As-
sociation occurred during the Congress. On June
17, Dr. Alberto Lleras Camargo, Secretary Gen-
eral of the Organization of American States, and
Ing. Joaquin Nunez Brian, of PARCA, signed an
agreement providing for ofﬁcial cooperation of
their two organizations through the exchange of
information and mutual assistance in the realiza-
tion of plans and programs being carried out by

the various countries. This marked the transition
from the informal relations which had existed for
many years to a more formal and deﬁnite relation-
ship for the future. Secondly the Congress
adopted a resolution providing for the revision of
the statutes of the Association. Since that resolu-
tion invited all national commissions to submit
their suggestions for revision, the U. S. National
Commiss1on has given careful consideration to the
matter and, with the assistance of the Department
of State, has recently (January 1954) sent to the
Permanent Commission of PARCA at Buenos Aires
a proposed new draft of the statutes for review
and comment by all of the other national com-
missions. Final action is expected to be taken at
the IX Congress in 1956.
Two other resolutions adopted at the Congress
related to the continuation of studies fundamental
to the international, as well as national, develop-
ment of American railway facilities. The Per-
manent Commission of PARCA was directed to con-
tinue work on the compilation of a glossa of
technical railway terms in Spanish and English
Such a glossary was deemed to be of vital impor-
tance to the standardization of railway accountin
and statistics as a basis for the measurement an
comparison of relative results of operation at-
tained by railroads in Latin America. The Per-
manent Commission was also directed to continue
studies designed to help American countries co~
ordinate the international trafﬁc of their railroads.
The Commission was asked in this connection to
give primary consideration to those studies relat-
ing to (1) railroad connections of the same gage
for the interchange of rolling stock, (2) railroad
connections of different gage and other circum-
stances which necessitate transfers, (3) currency
exchange and customs formalities, as such opera-
tions relate to international trafﬁc, which can be
regulated by common agreement between govern-
ments, and (4) “the uniﬁcation, if feasible, of rail-
road legislation and regulations of the countries of
the Americas as regards international traﬂic, pro-
vided that where traﬁic is now or hereafter inter-
changed between any two countries pursuant to
private arrangements legal under the laws of the
countries concerned, it is not the intention of
this subparagraph to advocate changes in such
arrangements.”
A resolution was also adopted by the Congress,
upon the initiative of the Mexican delegation, re-
questing the Inter-American Economic and So-
cial Council to constitute an Interim Committee
composed of specialized delegates from a small
number of countries, for the purpose of studying
the best methods of bringing about the coordina—
tion of all the various forms of transport of the
American Continent (railway, highway, water,
and air). The Pan American Union was re-
quested to provide appropriate secretariat facil-
ities therefor.
