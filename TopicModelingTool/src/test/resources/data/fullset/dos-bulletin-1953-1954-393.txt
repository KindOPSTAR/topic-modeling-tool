SOVIET NOTE 0F AUGUST 11, 1953
[Translation]
The Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Repub-
lics, conﬁrming the receipt of the note of the Government
of the United States of America of August 1, 1953, con-
siders it necessary to state the following:
As has already been communicated in the note of the
Soviet Government of July 31, four American ﬁghter
planes, having invaded the borders of the Chinese People’s
Republic on July 27 of this year, at 12:28 local time
(6:28 Moscow time), attacked and brought down over
Chinese territory a Soviet IL-12 passenger airplane, which
was making its regular ﬂight from Port Arthur to Vladi-
vostok on an established course. The attack of the Amer-
ican ﬁghters on an unarmed Soviet passenger airplane
took place 110 kilometers from the Chinese-Korean border
in the region of the Chinese city of Hua-tien (Khuadyan)
which is on the route of the regular airline from Port
Arthur to Vladivostok, along which Soviet passenger air-
planes have now been making ﬂights for several years
The coordinates of the Soviet airplane at the moment of
the attack on it by the American ﬁghter planes were 43
degrees 5 minutes north latitude and 127 degrees 45 min-
utes east longitude.
Upon receipt of the news of the attack by American
ﬁghters on the Soviet airplane and of the loss of the air-
plane as the result of this attack in the region of Hua-tien,
a special commission of the Chief Administration for the
Civil Airﬁeet of the U. S. S. R. was immediately dispatched
to investigate the circumstances relating to the loss of the
Soviet airplane. The commission discovered 15 corpses of
passengers and 6 corpses of crew members as well as re
mains of smashed airplane. The investigation conducted
by the commission showed that 6 corpses had bullet and
fragment wounds and the wreckage of the airplane which
was found had 19 bullet holes. Parachutes and other ob-
Jects located in the airplane also had bullet holes. In
addition, the commission interrogated loeal Chinese in-
habitants, who were witnesses of the attack by the Amer-
ican ﬁghter planes on the Soviet passenger airplane, who
completely conﬁrmed the facts set forth in the note of the
Soviet Government of July 31.
In its note of August 1 of this year, the Government of
the United States of Ameriica admits that American
ﬁghter planes attacked an airplane of the IL-12 type on
July 27 at 12: 25 local time, which, in regard to the
moment of the attack, approximately coincides with data
cited in the Soviet note. As the result of the attack re
ferred to, the IL-12 airplane was brought down. In
addition, however, the Government of the United States
of America alleges that the IL—12 airplane was attacked
by the American ﬁghter planes, not over Chinese territory,
but over the territory of Korea, approximately 8 miles
from the Yalu River at a point with coordinates 41 degrees
38 minutes north latitude and 126 degrees 55 minutes east
longitude. Such a statement is made despite the precisely
determined fact that the attack by the American ﬁghter
planes on the Soviet passenger plane actually took place,
not at the point indicated in the note of the Government
of the United States of America, but at a point with the
coordinates cited above of 43 degrees 5 minutes north
latitude and 127 degrees 45 minutes east longitude, which
is located, not on Korean territory 8 miles from the Yalu
River, but on Chinese territory 170 kilometers northeast
of the point cited in the note.
Thus, the time of the attack by the American ﬁghter
planes on the Soviet passenger airplane is correctly given
in the note of the Government of the United States of
America, but the place of the attack is incorrectly indi-
cated. Obviously the Government of the United States
of America has been misled regarding the place of the
attack by the American ﬁghter planes on the Soviet pas-
senger airplane.
In view of everything set forth above, the Soviet Gov-
ernment conﬁrms the decisive protest expressed in the
note of July 31 in connection with the piratical attack by
American military aircraft on the unarmed Soviet IL—12
passenger airplane and insists on severe punishment of
the persons guilty of this crime and also on the preven-
tion in future of such criminal actions by the American
military command.
At the same time the Soviet Government insists on com-
pensation by the Government of the United States of
America for the damage inﬂicted upon the Soviet Govern-
ment in connection with the loss of the abovementioned
21 Soviet citizens and the IL-12 airplane. The amount
of damages is set forth in enclosure to the present note.
Moscow, August 11, 1953.

Soviet Union in connection with the loss of the Soviet
III-12 airplane, its crew, and passengers, which occurred
