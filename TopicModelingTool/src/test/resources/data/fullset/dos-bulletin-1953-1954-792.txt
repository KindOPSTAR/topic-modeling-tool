The U.S. had iven up its right to intervene in
the protection 0% its national interest at a time
when the world enjoyed an apparently peaceful
era. As the rise of Hitler developed fresh tensions
in the world, it became clear that renewed atten-
tion should be given to problems of hemisphere
defense. Would the United States, under these
conditions, revert to its policy of unilateral re-
sponsibility, and take into its own hands the pro-
tection of the hemisphere by whatever measures
it considered desirable? Such a step would have
marked a reversal in the trend of U.S.-Latin
American policy. It was more in kee ing with
the attitude of mutual respect which un erlay the
good-neighbor policy for the U.S. to seek to share
with the other American Republics the respon-
sibility for making decisions on this matter of
general interest.
Development of Consultetlve Procedure
The ﬁrst step in the development of the collec-
tive-security system in the new world brought
forth the rocedure of consultation. First dis-
cussed at t e Inter-American Conference for the
Maintenance of Peace, held at the initiative of the
U.S. in Buenos Aires in 1936, the consultative
procedure was developed at the Eighth Inter-
American Conference in Lima, Peru, 2 years later.
At that meeting it was agreed that the Ministers
of Foreign Affairs of the American Republics
would meet if the peace and security of the con-
tinent were threatened. Within a year, following
the outbreak of World War II, this procedure
was set in motion with the holding of the First
Meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs at
Panama.
The war crystallized thinking in regard to col-
lective responsibility for continental defense. At
the Second Meeting of Foreign Ministers, held in
Habana in 1940, it was agreed that any attack by
a non-American State against an American State
would be considered as an attack on all. The
resolution incorporating this principle went on to
say that in the event of such an attack American
States would consult together in order to decide
upon the measures which should be taken. This
resolution was the basis on which, after the attack
on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. called upon the other
American Republics to participate in a wide vari-
ety of political, economic, and military activities
considered necessary for the defense of the
continent.
The cooperation of the American Republics
during World War II was of vital importance.
Its contributions, ﬁrst, to the military defense of
the continent, and, even more, to the economic
mobilization of the hemisphere’s resources, were
of tremendous signiﬁcance to the successful out-
come of the war. Moreover, one of its most im-
portant results was the legacy it gave to the future
in the form of an even more complete and effective
system of collective security.
During the last year of the war, with victory
and the establishment of peace already in si ht,
the American Republics met in Mexico Cit . ere,
looking forward to the creation of a worl organi-
zation on the basis of the Dumbarton Oaks pro-
posals, the American Republics agreed upon the
main lines of their permanent regional security
system. In the Act of Cha ultepec the principle
which had been adopted in abana 5 years earlier
was broadened to include any kind of an attack
against an American State, from whatever source.
Any attack against an American State—either by
a non-American State or by one American nation
against another—would henceforth be considered
as an act of a gression against all. This principle,
it was agree , would be written into a treaty to
be drawn up at a subsequent conference.
Two years later the Inter-American Treat of
Reciprocal Assistance was approved at the n-
ference in Rio de J aneiro.
Without going into detailed analysis of this
security arrangement, let us note the following
points which stand out as of particular signiﬁ-
cance:
1. An armed attack by any State against an
American State is to be cOns1dered as an armed
attack a ainst all, and calls for immediate assist-
ance to t e victim of the attack.
2. The parties to the treaty are obligated to con-
sult together in order to agree upon appropriate
measures in the event of (a) an armed attack as
mentioned above, or (b) in case the political in-
dependence or territorial integrity of any Ameri-
can State is threatened by any act of aggression or
any other fact or situation threatening the peace
of the hemisphere.
3. In such consultations the member states may
agree upon various sanctions, including breaking
of relations, economic sanctions, and the use of
armed force. Except for the use of armed force,
the decisions made regarding these sanctions are
binding upon all parties to the treaty if approved
by a majority of two-thirds.
4. The various provisions of the treaty are so
drafted as to make them conform to the United
Nations Charter.
This then is the legal basis for the collective-
security system of the Organization of American
States. I should like to offer some observations
regarding the application of this collective-secu-
rity system in regard to three main problems, all
of which have some current pertinence. These
are ﬁrst, the military defense of the continent;
second, the maintenance of peace among the Amer-
ican States; and third, the problem of aggression
by means of subversive activities.
