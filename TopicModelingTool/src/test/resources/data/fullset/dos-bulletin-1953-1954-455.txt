Another aspect of the economic agreement which
might be stressed is that pertaining to the encour-
agement of capital investment in Spain. It is
our hope that private capital will to an increas-
ing degree help to ﬁll the role played largely by
my! Government in recent years. In order to
ac ieve this oal, it is necessary that conditions
be established in the world encouraging private
capital to seek out sound investment prospects, al-
ways, of course, in accordance with the laws of the
host country. We believe that this is one of the
principal means whereb countries can establish
and maintain strong an healthy economies, and
raise their living standards.
l/Vith that in mind, it is interesting to note that
American private investment in forei business
operations now exceeds $16 billion, 0 which a -
proximately one-fourth has been invested in t e
gale 3 years. \Ve fully realize that the United
tates should itself take certain steps to see that
this level of investment is maintained and even
increased. With that in mind, the President re-
centl recommended in his budget message that
the nited States tax laws be modiﬁed so that no
deterrents will exist to United States investment
abroad but rather that it will be encouraged.
I know from what your own Government oﬁi-
cials have said that Spain likewise is interested
in this subject. It is heartening to know that
there are presently some American ﬁrms, in addi-
tion to those already located here, which are con-
sidering investing in Spain, and I hope it will
be possible for them to do so.
Unity at Free World
The world is still subjected to the pressures of
international tensions, and while we hope that
lVestern efforts to reduce these tensions will suc-
ceed, we must at the same time be prepared for
any other eventuality. During the past year, as
President Eisenhower told the American people
recently, a reat strategic change has taken place.
He said, “that precious intangible, the initiative,
is becoming ours.” He added that freedom is
threatened so long as the World Communist con-
spiracy exists in its present scope, power, and hos-
tility. And, as he put it, American freedom is in-
terlocked with the freedom of other people more
closely now than ever before, and in the unity of
the free world lies our best chance to reduce the
Communist threat without war.
I think we will all agree that our Western
civilization is confronted today by the greatest
danger in its history. In the face of this danger,
and while we are preparing our defenses on the
economic and military fronts, we must not allow
ourselves to be diverted from our ﬁrm and noble
purpose. It is with encouragement therefore that
we have witnessed the unity so notably displayed
by the United States, Great Britain, and France
at the recent meeting in Berlin—a unity that held
fast despite diversionary tactics which sought to
divide and play off one a ainst the other.
Our partnership with pain likewise must be
forged in an unbreakable manner, on good will and
mutual, sovereign cooperation. In this way we
shall go forward toward world peace and secu-
rity‘, devoted to the high cause in which we believe.
e are beginning the year 1954 with conﬁdence
that our two nations, in the cooperative spirit that
marked the signing of our economic and military
agreements last September, will make substantial
Erogress this Iyear in carrying out these accords.
ach step wil add ho e and promise to the West
while proving to the orces which seek to divide
and conquer us that they face a hopeless task.
Release of John Hvasta
Press release 147 dated March 19
Following are the temts of (1) a letter addressed
by John Hvasta to Secretary Dulles On March 4
and (2) Secretary Dulles’ reply dated March 16':
LETTER FROM MR. HVASTA
MARCH 4, 1954
MY DEAR MR. SECRETARY: I am most grateful
for your good wishes on my return home to the
United States after so man years of unjust im-
prisonment in Communist zechoslovakia.1
As I’m sure you understand, it was a difﬁcult
time, but still an encouraging one—since I found
so many friends of our country behind the Iron
Curtain.
The good services of the State Department and
of yourself were, of course, most helpful during
all that time—a debt that I shall not easily be
able to repay. The help of the truly democratic,
freedom-lovmg people of Czechoslovakia was also
very substantial in preserving me through these
long months.
As you know, I was received and welcomed in
our Embassy in Prague as well as given every-
thing necessary to restore me to normal life once
more. I take this 0 portunity to convey my
thanks throu h you to Ambassadors George Wads-
worth and Alexis Johnson, who were directl
very helpful. Please transmit my deepest grati-
tude to all the other members of our Prague Em-
bassy and of the De artment who were so
considerate. The well- ept secret of my four
month stay at our Embassy is to be credited di-
rectly to you and your ofﬁcials.
Most sincerely
J OHN HVASTA
