of national freedom, have become Soviet serfdoms
OI‘ “'OI‘SG.
Within all the vast area, now embracin
third of the world’s eople, where the military
power of the Soviet nion is dominant, no oﬂicial
can be found who would dare to stand 11 and
openly attack the Government of the Soviet nion.
But in this hemis here, it takes no coura e for the
representative ofp one of the smallest merican
countries openly to attack the government of the
most powerful.
I rejoice that that kind of freedom exists in the
Americas, even if it may be at times abused. But
the essential is that there be a relationship of sov-
ereign uality. We of the United States want to
keep it t at way. We seek no satellites, but only
friendly equals. We never want to see at the
pan-American table those who speak as the tools
of non-American powers. We want to preserve
and defend an American society, in which even the
weak may speak boldly, because they re resent
national personalities which, as long as t ey are
free, are equal.
It is the purpose of our resolution to assure that
there will alwa s be in this hemisphere such
national persona ities and dignity.
If new we turn to see what international com-
munism has done to the individual human beings,
we ﬁnd that it has stripped them, too, of their
sense of dignity and worth. The rofessional
propagandists for communism talk gh 1y of lofty
aims and hi h ideals. That is part of the rou-
tine—and raudulent—appeal of the inter-
national Communist movement. It is one of the
principal means by which the dissatisﬁed are led
to follow false leaders. But once international
communism has gained its end and sub'ected the
people to the so-called “dictatorship o the pro-
etariat,” then the welfare of the people ceases to
be a matter of practical concern.

Communlsm and the Worker
Communism, in its initial theoretical stage, was
designed primarily to serve the workers and to
provide them, not with spiritual values, for com-
munism is atheistic, but at least with a material
well-being. It is worthwhile to observe what has
actually happened to this favored group in
countries subjugated by Communist power.
In these countries the workers have become vir-
tual slaves, and millions of them are literally
slaves. Instructive facts are to be found in the
United Nations Report on Forced Labor, which
was presented to the United Nations Assembly at
its last session.1 The authors of this report were
three eminent and independent personalities from
India, Norway, and Peru. The report ﬁnds that

the Soviet Union and its satellites use forced labor
on a vast scale. Prior evidence presented to the
United Nations indicates that a proximately 15
million persons habitually ﬁll 5m Soviet labor
cam .
Th): Forced Labor Re rt calls the Soviet
method of training and al ocating manpower “A
s stem of forced or compulsory labor.” The
oviet workers are the most underpaid, over-
worked persons in any modern industrial state.
They are the most mana ed, checked-on, s ied-on,
and unrepresented wor ers in the worl today.
There is no freedom of movement, for the Russian
worker is not allowed to leave his job and shift to
another job. He is bound to his Job by his labor
book. Except for the relative few who have class
rivile es, wages provide only a pitiful existence.
0w, 3 years after the October revolution, unrest
and discontent have so mounted in Soviet Russia
that the rulers are forced publicly to notice them
and to promise relief.
Conditions in the Soviet satellite countries are
even worse than in Russia. The captive peoples
have been subjected to sharply decreased living
standards, since they lost their freedom, and to
greater exploitation than prevails in Russla. The
workers’ outbreak in East Germany of last June
showed in one revealing ﬂash how des erate the
people have become. Young boys arm only with
stones dared to face up to Soviet tanks.
When I was in the East Sector of Berlin last
month, the Soviet Foreign Minister referred to
that outbreak, and he said that steps had been
taken to be sure that it did not happen again. I
saw those steps. They consisted of thousands
upon thousands of heavily armed soldiers, with
machineguns and tanks.
Traditions of liberty have been established in
this hemisphere under the leadershi of many
great patriots. They fought for individual hu-
man rights and dignity. hey lighted the id-
ing beacons alon freedom’s road, which ave
burned brightl 1n the healthy air of patriotic
fervor. These eacons must not be stiﬂed by the
poisonous air of despotism now being fanned
toward our shores from Moscow, Prague, and
Budapest.
These places may seem far away. But let us
not forget that in the early part of the last century
the ﬁrst danger to the liberties and independence
which Bolivar, San Martin, and their heroic asso-
ciates had won for the new Republics stemmed
precisely from the despotic alliance forged by the
Czar of Russia.
Sometimes, it seems, we recall that threat only
in terms of colonialism. Actually, the threat that
was deemed most grave was the desire of Czarist
Russia and its allies to extend their despotic polit-
ical system to this hemisphere.
I recall that President Monroe, in his message
to Congress of December 2, 1823, addressed him-
self particularly to that phase of the problem. He
