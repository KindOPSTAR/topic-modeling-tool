(80th), the so—called Vandenberg Resolution?
Presumably, the United States would itself hesi-
tate to go much further than this in now sur-
rendering its “veto power.”
4. General Assembly Voting—In the General
Assembly, each nation has one vote. Is this the
best arrangement? If the General Assembly is
to assume greater responsibilities, then should
there not be some form of weighted voting, so
that nations which are themselves unable to as-
sume serious military or ﬁnancial responsibilities
cannot put those responsibilities on other nations?
Should there be, in some matters, a combination
vote whereby afﬁrmative action requires both a
majority of all the members, on the basis of sover-
eign equality, and also a majority vote, on a
weighted basis, which takes into account popula-
tion, resources, etc?
5. Armament—Since the charter was adopted,
there has been a vast development of possibilities
of mass destruction, particularly in terms of
atomic energy and nuclear weapons.
As one who was at San Francisco in the spring
of 1945, I can sa with conﬁdence that, had the
delegates at San rancisco known we were enter-
ing the age of atomic warfare, they would have
seen to it that the charter dealt more positively
with the problems thus raised. Perhaps con-
sideration should now be given to the creation of
a special organ of the United Nations comparable
to the Economic and Social Council and the
Trusteeshi Council to deal permanently with the
problem 0 armament which carries so hideous a
threat to the hopes of the peoples expressed in the
preamble to the charter.
In this connection, I em hasize the President’s
e och-making proposal of ecember 8, 1953, to the
nited Nations suggesting the creation of an in-
ternational atomic-energy agency to receive con-
tributions of normal uranium and ﬁssionable ma-
terials and to devise methods whereby this avail-
able material would be allocated to serve the peace
ful pursuits of mankind.2
6. International Law—In view of the impor-
tance of law as an accepted standard of inter-
national conduct, are the charter provisions ade-
auate (article 13 (1) (a))? These call on the
eneral Assembly to initiate studies and make
recommendations for the purpose of encouraging
the progress and develo ment of international law
and its codiﬁcation. owever, so far little prog-
ress has been made. This is a reat handicap to
world order, because it means t at decisions and
recommendations of the United Nations are apt to
be governed by considerations of political expedi-
ency rather than by accepted international law.
In this connection I recall the late Senator Taft’s
conviction “that in the lon run the only way to
establish peace is to write a aw, a eed to b each
of the nations, to overn the re ations 0 such
nations with each 0t 1er and to obtain the covenant
’ Buusrm of Dec. 21, 1953, p. 847.
of all such nations that they will abide by that law
and by decisions made thereunder.” (A Foreign
Policy for Americans, 1951.)
Simultaneous progress on a global scale is pres-
ently impeded b a sharp cleavage with reference
to the nature of law. Most of the governments of
the world regard “law” as man’s effort to ap ly
moral principles to human affairs. There is t us
an objective standard of justice which can be a -
pealed to. However, one third of the worl ’s
population is ruled by those who do not recognize
any moral law and look upon human “law” as a
means whereby those in power achieve their 0b-
jectives and destroy their enemies.
7. The foregoing are the more important char-
ter amendment issues which particularly concern
the United States. There are doubtless other as-
ects which are of great concern to other countries.
lilowever, I refrain from making any statement
about those matters at this time.
Conclusion
It is in my opinion im ortant that the United
States should approach t is problem of charter
review with recognition that the charter as it is
can be made to serve well the cause of interna-
tional peace and justice. The defects in the char-
ter can to a considerable extent be corrected by
practices which are permissible under the charter.
Already it is accepted practice that if a permanent
member of the Security Council abstains from vot-
ing, that does not constitute a veto despite the
fact that article 27 (3) provides for the ‘ afﬁrma-
tive vote of seven members, including the concur-
ring votes of the permanent members.”
I have already referred to the “Uniting for
Peace Resolution” which gave the Assembly a
vetoless authority in security matters.
It is also necessa to bear in mind that much
can be done within t e framework of the charter,
but without actual de endence u on the proce-
dures of the United ations itse f. I have re-
ferred to article 51, which recognizes the right of
collective self-defense. This has been extensively
used. Many nations havin similar security in-
terests have banded toget er through security
acts. There are the Rio Pact, the North Atlantic
reaty, and comparable security arrangements be-
tween the United States and other countries in
the Western Paciﬁc. The Soviets have also built
their own security system with a series of so-called
treaties with their satellites.
Such arrangements operate free of Security
Council veto, although self-defense measures are
required to be reported to the Security Council.
I have stated some of the problems which will
probably be raised in a 1956 Review Conference,
without attempting to give categorical answers.
That would, I think, be premature for me. Let
me repeat, however, that while a Charter Review
Conference should be welcomed as a means of
