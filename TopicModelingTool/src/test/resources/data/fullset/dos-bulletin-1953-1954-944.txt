ration. Slightly more than one-hal of the shares
will be in Pakistani ownership; the Burmah Oil
Company Ltd. and the Commonwealth Develop-
ment Finance Company Ltd. of the United King-
dom will hold the remainder.
The Eastern Exchange Banks, a grou of six
banks doing business in Asia, have a cc to par-
ticipate in today’s loan, without the nternational
Bank’s guarantee, to the extent of £645,000 ($1,-
806,000) . This represents the ﬁrst seven maturities
of the loan, fallin due semiannually from August
1, 1956, through 11 ust 1, 1959. The artici at-
ing banks are The C artered Bank of ndia, us-
tralia & China; Eastern Bank, Limited; Grind-
lays Bank Limited; Lloyds Bank Limited;
Mercantile Bank of India, Limited; and the Na-
tional Bank of India, Limited.
The develo ment of natural gas will provide
Pakistan wit an im ortant domestic source of
fuel. Pakistan has re atively meager supplies of
coal and oil. Of its annual coal requirements of
about 1.2 million tons, 600,000 tons are now im-
ported; and fuel oil imports avera e more than
500,000 tons a year. By providing re atively cheap
and abundant supplies of the new fuel, the Sui gas
project will in time save large amounts of forelgn
exchange. In the ﬁrst year of operations gas from
the project will be equivalent in fuel value to
some 500,000 tons of coal, and, as plant capacity is
reached, it will be triple this amount.
Assistance to Rallways
In French West Africa
The International Bank on June 10 made a loan
of $7.5 million to assist a program being carried
out to modernize the railways of French West
Africa. J. P. Morgan & Co., Incor orated, has
agreed to partici ate in the loan, wit out the In-
ternational Ban ’s guarantee, to the extent of
$609,000 covering the ﬁrst two maturities of the
10!“; falling due on December 1, 1956, and June 1,
195 .
Efﬁcient rail transport is essential to the trade
and future development of French West Africa.
Distances are great: the country is about three-
ﬁfths the size of the United States and eight times
that of France. About three-quarters of the op-
ulation of 18 million live more than 200 miles fi'om
the Atlantic coast. Without the railways the inte-
rior would be largely cut off from world commerce;
traﬁic on the major rivers is hampered by sand-
bars, rapids, and wide seasonal variations in the
water level, while long motor roads have proved
costly to build and maintain. At present about
four-ﬁfths of the freight carried by the railways
moves in overseas trade. Exports consist chieﬂy of
cocoa, coﬁ'ee, peanuts, bananas, pahn oil, and other
tropical products.
The railways consist of four separate meter-ga e
lines. They total 3,750 kilometers (2,250 miles) in
)~ _ ~zt______
length and run inland towards the Ni er River
from the widely separated ports of Da ar, Con-
akry, Abidjan, and Porto Novo.
During the Second World \Var the railways suf-
fered seriously from lack of replacement parts and
could not be adequately maintained. In 1947,
therefore, the French authorities began a long-
range program to modernize equipment and in-
crease operating efﬁciency. This program is ex-
pected to cost the equivalent of $90 million and
to be completed in 1957.
Track, telecommunications, and repair facilities
are being im roved, rollin stock modernized, and
the existin ect of steam ﬁocomotives is being re-
placed by giesels throughout the system. By the
end of 1952 the equivalent of $45 million had been
spent and about half the pro ram completed. In
t e meantime, the volume 0 freight carried has
risen to a level two-thirds greater than prewar.
The bank’s loan will rovide funds for the ur-
chase of 35 diesel malnline locomotives an 34
diesel switching engines for the two longest and
most heavily used lines, running from Dakar, in
the territory of Senegal, into the Sudan, and from
Abidjan, in the Ivory Coast, into the Upper Volta.
Bids for the locomotives were solicited on an inter-
national basis, and French suppliers were success-
ful. The diesels will be cheaper to operate than
the steam locomotives they will replace and can
be expected to pay for themselves in about 6 years.
The loan is for a term of 12 years and carries
interest at 41/; percent, including the statutory
1-percent commission charged by the bank. The
equipment bought with the proceeds of the loan
will be used by the French West African Rail-
way Administration, which operates the railways
under the supervision of the Central Ofﬁce for
French Overseas Railways. The Central Oﬂice
is the borrower, and the loan is guaranteed by the
Re ublic of France.
After having been approved by the bank’s ex-
ecutive directors, the loan documents were signed
by His Excellency Henri Bonnet, Ambassador of
France to the United States, on behalf of the Re-
public of France; by Frederic Surleau, President
of the Central Ofﬁce for French Overseas Rail-
ways, on behalf of the Central Ofﬁce; by Henri
Cuneo, Inspector General of Public Works for
French Overseas Territories, on behalf of the
French West African Railway Administration;
and by Eugene R. Black, President, on behalf of
the International Bank.
