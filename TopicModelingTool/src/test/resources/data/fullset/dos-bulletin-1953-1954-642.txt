Observance of Pan American Day
Addresses by Henry F. Holland
Assistant Secretary for Inter-American Affairs
THE AMERICAN STATES:
THE HOUSE OF FREEDOMl
It is a rivile e and a ver at leasure, to
meet withpyou hgre in the Holisgloef thI; Americas
on Pan American Day.
It is an impressive and moving experience for
one who has so recently entered into the duties
and responsibilities of my oiiice to come to this
historic council table around which the representa-
tives of the 21 sovereign and independent repub-
lics of this hemisphere have gathered for so many
years in an atmosphere of freedom and equality.
It is particularly gratifying to me to have this
opportunity to partici ate in this ceremony with
t e distinguished mem rs of the Council of the
Organization of American States.
The op ortunity accorded me last month at
Caracas 0 working with some of you, and with so
many other eminent statesmen of the sister Re-
publics, in the day-to-day labor of the Tenth
Inter-American Conference,’ will remain with me
as one of the most valuable experiences of my life.
I should like to take this opportunity to express
again the sincere appreciation of my Government
for the magniﬁcent manner in which the Govern-
ment of Venezuela prepared for and conducted
the Tenth Inter-American Conference, and for the
cordial hospitality which was extended through-
out the meeting.
Let me include most especially among those with
whom it was an honor to work Dr. Alberto Lleras
Camargo, Secretary General of the Organization
of American States, whose resignation all of us
deeply regret and whose successor, whoever he may
be, will ﬁnd his own work the easier and the more
productive because of the soil that has been tilled
by so able a husbandman. I am conﬁdent that
this Council will wish to set about the extremely
‘ Made at the Extraordinary Meeting of the Council of
the Organization of American States, at the Pan American
Union, on Apr. 14 (press release 195 dated Apr. 13).

dillicult task of selecting a successor to Dr. Lleras
with all the wisdom and deliberation that the
decision demands.
A Pattern for International Followshlp
The environment of the Pan American Union,
like the environment of the Inter-American Con-
ference, is one of friendship and cooperation. The
Organization of American States, this congress
of our 21 Republics which is an exam 1e and a
pattern for fellowship among nations, as a con-
tinuing responsibility to prove to the rest of the
world the soundness of enlightened cooperation
among nations. Abraham Lincoln expressed an
important concept of our relationship when he
said “I shall do nothing in malice, for what I deal
with is too vast for malicious dealin .”
In this House of the Americas, and on this Pan
American Day, we can summon up, each one of us
for all the rest, the gracious, traditional His anic
phrase: “You are in your house.” In this emi-
sphere we have learned the validity of that phrase,
neighbor to neighbor, nation to nation. As in-
dividuals we have learned to feel at home any-
where in our America, with its vast roof over
arching Rockies and Andes, Mississippi and Ama-
zon, extending from Paciﬁc to Atlantic and from
Arctic North to Antarctic South. It is the home
of freedom, the haven of peace, and within its
mighty structure the 21 Republics of this hemi-
sphere prove from experience that in cooperation
is strength and security.
It is no exaggeration to say that the active, ef-
fective cooperation of the American Republics
during more than a half century has blazed a trail
through the wilderness of international suspicion
and conﬂict. Antedating the United Nations, and
in considerable measure affording the lessons of
experience for its workings, the Organization of
American States is one of the regional groupings
through which the U.N. Charter is strengthened
and made more effective. Similarly, the Rio
Treaty, a forerunner of the North Atlantic Treat
and other regional pacts, has helped cement co -
lective security.
