be foreseen in the acce tance of the amendment by
the United States an other countries. Most im-
portant to us would be the assurance that foreign
visitors driving on our highways have met reason-
able standards of capability and proﬁciency. We
are already, by the 1949 convention, committed to
the recognition of foreign driving permits; the
amendment would only uire that our foreign
visitors be generally as will qualiﬁed as our own
drivers.
Most of our own drivers, even under the
strengthened international requirements, would
continue to enjoy foreign driving privileges. With
few exceptions, the licensing procedures in all our
States substantially meet the requirements for
“proof of competence” as deﬁned in the amend-
ment. Most of our States follow standards recom-
mended by the American Association of Motor
Vehicle Administrators and grant permits only
after tests of driving ability, knowledge of trafﬁc
laws, and eyesight. The applicant also must make
a formal certiﬁcation that he is not suffering from
certain speciﬁed physical or mental disabilities. A
driver licensed in a substandard State, however, if
he wished to drive in a foreign country, would have
to obtain another license in a State where adequate
examinations are given.
Some difﬁculty might be experienced, at least
initially, if local enforcement oﬂicials failed to
accept the validity of foreign licenses that would
have to be recognized under the amended con-
vention. This could be minimized by the sys-
tematic circulation of a list of the countries in
which “proof of competence” must be demon-
strated.
The amendment, of itself, would require no new
legislation or change of administrative procedure
in any State. A State that does not have ade-
quate licensing standards, however, would be
under pressure for improvement for the beneﬁt of
its citizens who wish to travel abroad. Any such
improvement, indeed, would require only the ac-
ceptance of standards already well established in
this country.
On the basis of the foregoing considerations the
Department of State, in January 1954, replied
to the U.N. Secretary-General in the following
terms:
consent. the United States Government will accept the
proposed amendment.
4. When the amendment comes into force, the United
Nations should arrange for the preparation and circu-
lation to the member nations of information as to the
nations and political subdivisions whose domestic re-
quirements for driver licensing meet satisfactorily the
international requirements, to be periodically revised and
brought up to date.
5. When the amendment comes into force the United
States Government will advise the appropriate authori-
ties of the various states of the Union concerning the
provisions of the amendment, and will transmit to them
periodically current information as to the foreign drivers'
permits that are to be recognized as valid in this country.
The second proposed agreement relating to inter-
national motor travel deals with a worldwide uni-
form svstem of road si s, signals, and markings.
The advantages of suc 1 uniformity as a conveni-
ence to the tourist and as an aid to greater safety
are obvious.
A Protocol on Road Signs and Signals, prescrib-
ing a uniform system for such trafﬁc control de-
vices, was approved by the 1949 Conference on
Road and Motor Transport as a part of the 1949
convention. The United States was not able to
sign or ratify this protocol, since it was based
w lolly on European practices and was quite in-
consistent with the eXIsting American standards.
On the recommendation of the Conference, the
United Nations in 1950 appointed a special group
of six experts, including, as its North American
representative, the late H. E. Hilts, Deputy Com-
missioner of the United States Bureau of Public
Roads, to stud the problem of possible further
uniﬁcation. T is group, after full consideration
of existing systems and extensive research into the
visibility, legibility, and intelligibility of various
combinations of sign shapes, colors, and symbolize-
tion, submitted in 1952 its recommendations for in-
corporating in a single standard what appeared to
be the best elements of existing practices.
The United Nations Economic and Social Coun-
cil, by resolution of April 15, 1953, decided to sub-
stitute the new proposals for the 1949 protocol and
authorized the Secretary-General to consult with
the various nations as to whether the new protocol
should be opened for signature and ratiﬁcation.
In response to an inquiry from the Secretary-
General, the Department of State, in November
1953, re lied in terms which sum up brieﬂy the
potentia value of the roposed agreement in many
parts of the world, w ile indicating, at the same
time, the reasons why this country cannot accept it :
1. The United States Government regards with satis-
faction the recommendations of the United Nations with
reference to the qualiﬁcations of motor vehicle drivers
in international trafﬁc. The United States. since 1952,
has been a party to the Convention on Road Trafﬁc of
1949, to which the present recommendations constitute
only an amendment defining “proof of competence”.
2. The amendment will provide a more deﬁnite safe-
guard against unqualiﬁed drivers in international traf-
ﬁc, and so will be of mutual beneﬁt to all parties to the
Convention.
3. The Executive Branch of the United States Govern-
ment will accordingly submit to the Senate of the United
States, for its advice and consent to ratiﬁcation. the pro-
posed amendment to Annex 8 of the Convention on Road
Trafﬁc of 1949. If the Senate gives such advice and
1. The United States Government regards with satis-
faction the work performed to date by the United Nations
in preparing the Protocol on a Uniform System of Road
Signs and Signals for worldwide application. The report
of the United Nations group of experts, in which an ofﬁcer
of this government participated as the regional repre-
sentative for North America, is an excellent one. The
Protocol represents a fair compromise among the various
systems of signs and signals now in use, and incorporates
many features of current American practice. The report
