staying alive and attempting to reconstruct some
kind of order from the ruins of their nation 0c-
cupied all their ener ies until very recent years.
Therefore, the great iﬁerence in attitude between
Germany today and 30 years ago, one may well
say, is a consequence of the total defeat of Ger-
many in World War II followed by the decision
of the Western allies to revent the sovietization
of all of Germany by the ussians during the occu-
pation period. Certainly the military events of
1944 and 1945 and the East-West diplomatic
strug le between the occupying powers of the
period 1945 to 1949 set the scene for Germany
today and for some years to come.
When we talk of German , it is well to bear
in mind that there are three ermanys: The Fed-
eral Republic com rising that portion of the for-
mer German Reic lyin in the occupation zones
of the British, the Frenc , and the Americans, in-
cluding some 50 million inhabitants; the Russian
Zone with its 18 million Germans lying to the
East' and the city of Berlin, the Western sectors
of which are an island of freedom dee in the
heart of the Soviet-occupied territory. hen I
have been speaking about the attitude of the Ger-
mans, I have referred to the attitude of the citizens
of the Federal Republic and West Berlin. What
the people living in the Soviet Zone feel about the
past and future can be deduced from the evidence
supplied by thousands of refugees. But the tragic
fate of these 18 million Germans is one of the
brutal facts of history which stand before the eyes
of the fortunate Germans who live in the West-
ern Zones. The dramatic events of June 17 last
year underline the plight of the East Germans.
They also demonstrated their courage and their
desire for freedom.
In the almost 9 ears that have elapsed since
the end of World ar II, the 50 million Germans
in the Federal Republic have been able to recon-
struct a free democratic form of government
which I hope and believe will soon be essentially
sovereign. The cultural life of Western Ger-
many, thanks to the wisdom of the British, the
French, and the Americans, is again beginning to
ﬂourish in an atmosphere of democrac and free-
dom. As to the physical rebuilding ofy West Ger-
many, that is a fact so striking and so well known
as to require no underlining to this audience.
Thanks very largely to American aid, ﬁrst by s e-
cial ap ropriations and then through the ar-
shall p an, but thanks also to the energetic and
skillful use of those funds by the Germans, Ger-
man industry has revived and the cities are in
process of being rapidly rebuilt. A traveler
through Western Germany today will ﬁnd all the
signs of a prosperous, stable, industrialized so-
ciety and, unless our economic experts are com-
pletely wrong, the prospects for the continued
satisfactory development of industry and com-
merce in Western Germany are excellent indeed.
The currency is stable and the relation between
M ay 17, 1954
the banking system and the overnment is such
as to insure a stable ﬁnancia polic . The atti-
tude of the economic advisers o Chancellor
Adenauer is very much on the side of the Ameri-
can concepts of initiative and free enter rise.
There is further evidence of the growin sta ility
and health of the German economic an ﬁnancial
situation which is of particular interest to Ameri-
cans. The Federal Government, in recent months,
has found it possible to eliminate restrictions on
the import from the United States of nearl 3,000
commodities, many of which are of consi erable
importance to our agriculture. It has also sub-
stantially reduced restrictions on the transfer of
earnings on investments in Germany of U.S. resi-
dents and on transfer of so-called ‘blocked mark
accounts.”
Contrast Between East and West Zones
Contrast all this with what has been going on in
such cities as Lei zig, Dresden, and the Soviet
sector of Berlin. ere a puppet government was
installed by Soviet ﬁat in 1949 and later given
the appearance of constitutionalit through sham
elections in 1950 which favored t e Communists.
While the degrees of the severity of the regime
have varied from time to time, the characteristics
of a totalitarian state have been resent from the
day of the surrender of Germany in 1945. Indeed,
and this is important, you must remember that
great numbers of the inhabitants of this eastern
part of Germany can never recall a time when they
have not lived either under the totalitarian rule
of the Nazis or the tyranny of the Soviet occupy-
ing forces. The economic situation reﬂects the
attempts of the Soviets to push their system west-
ward to the Elbe River; the farms have been
collectivized and the stores and industries largely
nationalized. Those who have visited the cities
in the Russian Zone tell me the physical contrast
between the East and West is so evident as to be
shocking.
Certainly as I myself have seen so often in
Berlin, there is a great distinction between West
Berlin, our side of the fence, with its well-stocked
shops, well-dressed inhabitants motorcars, new or
rebuilt libraries, churches and theaters, and its
general air of freedom, and East Berlin, the Soviet
side of the fence. When one enters the Soviet
sector, one sees drabness and depression. In spite
of the much vaunted Stalinallee, a workers’ hous-
ing development built alon Moscow lines, not a
great deal of reconstruction has taken place.
Above all else one is oppressed by the atmosphere
of police control and austerity.
The control in East Berlin and the East Zone is
actually the control of Moscow. The appearances
could lead a naive observer to think that the Ger-
man Communist regime were masters in their own
house. This facade has been redecorated recently
by the proclamation of the sovereignty of the pup-
