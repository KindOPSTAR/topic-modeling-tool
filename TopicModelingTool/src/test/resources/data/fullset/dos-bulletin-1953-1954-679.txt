million for farm and manufacturin equipment to
boost its food output, the Foreign perations Ad-

1tems as self-propelled combines and spare parts
and tires and tubes for tractors.

support pro am, brings to $46 million the amount
authorized or Turkey in the current ﬁscal year.

than one-third of their budget to their military
establishment—a key factor in the NATO program.
