needed to meet the Soviet Union’s basic food
requirements.
\Vith regard to the countries of Eastern Europe,
the survey concludes that “the assignment of 1n-
creased resources to consumption seems now to
be . . . not only urgent for welfare reasons,
but also a recognized necessity for the further
growth of industry itself.” If this judgment is
correct, consumers in the East may have real
grounds for hope.
For the student of economic policies and tech-
niques—t0 say nothing of the student of com-
parative political systems—one of the most inter-
esting aspects of the chapters on Eastern Europe
is the stress put on the degree to which it has been
found necessary to soften the instruments of com-
pulsion, and to rely increasingly instead on the
instruments of individual incentive. If such a
shift does in fact take place to any signiﬁcant
degree, not only the living standards but also the
methods of economic policy in East and \Vest may
be found to be moving closer together.
Economic Development In Southern Europe
The Secretariat is to be commended for its com-
grehensive and original analysis of the economic
evelopment of the Southern European countries.
My Government has long considered the develop-
ment needs of these countries of fundamental im-
portance, and we welcome the survey’s s ecial at-
tention to these areas. The analysis 0 the his-
torical develo ment and current problems of the
countries of outhern Europe is a major achieve-
ment of comprehensiveness and compression.
These chapters in the survey will serve as a source
of information and ideas for all who are inter-
ested in this ﬁeld; and we can all hope that the
Secretariat efforts will stimulate both further
analyses of the problems at issue and further ac-
tion. The major responsibility for action must
of course necessarily rest primarily with the indi-
vidual governments concerned.
At thls session, since the issue as an entit is
under consideration by the EOE for the ﬁrst time,
we shall not attempt to discuss the details of this
section of the survey. For the time being, we
prefer to listen carefully and consider- further the
comments of the countries primarily concerned
and the other European countries with whom their
economies are so interrelated, before making s e-
ciﬁc judgments on the policies recommended y
the surve .
The fofiowing are some preliminary and tenta-
tive observations. Three main obstacles to the
development of indust are noted by the surve —
the lack of public utilities, necessitating hig ier
than average investment to obtain ower, access,
and the like; the inefﬁciency of the abor supply;
and the lack of savings. The survey points out the
lack of a favorable environment for enterprise in
Southern Europe and rightly stresses the vital
necessity of measures of “pre-industrialization”
to improve their climate. In this way, when in-
dustrial enterprises are launched, they can hope
to survive and grow eﬂ'ectively without high pro-
tection and artiﬁcial props which simply make
them more costly to the community.
We are gratiﬁed that, although suggesting a
moderate ad valorem tariﬂ' in the Southern coun-
tries for industry generally, the survey rejects
sharply increased protectionism as a solution to
these problems. Such measures could hardly be
expected to correct the basic diﬁiculties limiting
the develo ment of these countries. A more con-
structive ong-range solution would be the ro-
motion of internal domestic conditions w ich
would attract investment capital, either ublic or
private, from other areas. This woul involve
vigorous efforts to control inﬂationary pressures
and external deﬁcits. It would also include such
positive measures of self-help as described by the
survey in the case of Italy.
We recognize that assistance from the more de-
veloped countries is important in creating favor-
able conditions for investment. Bilateral and in-
ternational programs, such as those in the ﬁeld of
technical assistance and productivity, are among
the most fruitful approaches toward overcoming
the limitations of recently established government
machinery, the lack of managerial and technical
personnel, and the resistance to new methods,
which the survey notes as obstacles to large and
rapid increases in the capital structure of the less
developed countries. To these public programs
must be added the technical contribution which
ex erienced private companies are making in con-
tri utin engineering and management services in
the deve opment of new industries in the Southern
European countries.
In comin to the end of my statement, I am
conscious 0 having failed to touch at all on a
number of important aspects of the survey and
of having dealt only very madequately with others.
But, in a statement of reasonable length, justice
can never be done to some 200-odd pages of the
com rehensiveness and quality of the survey. I
wou (1 only conclude b ex ressing again our ad-
miration and thanks or t e Secretariat’s work,
and wishing them another equally fruitful year.
