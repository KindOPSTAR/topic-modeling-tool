U. S. ASSURANCES CONCERNING EDC
White House press release dated April 16
As the time approaches for historic decision on
the remaining measures required to put into effect
the European Defense Community Treaty, it is
appropriate for me to state clearly the United
States position on the relation between the Euro-
pean Army and the European Community on the
one hand, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organi-
zation and the broader Atlantic Community on the
other hand. The essential elements of this posi-
tion, which have been discussed with leaders of
both political parties in the Congress, may be
sim ly stated.
The United States is ﬁrmly committed to the
North Atlantic Treaty. This Treaty is in accord-
ance with the basic securit interests of the United
States and will steadfast y serve those interests
regardless of the ﬂuctuations in the international
situation or our relations with any country. The
obligations which the United States has assumed
under the Treaty will be honored.
The North Atlantic Treaty has a signiﬁcance
which transcends the mutual obligations assumed.
It has engendered an active practical working re-
lationship among the Atlantic nations. Throu h
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, t 0
United States and its allies are working to build
the concrete strength needed to deter aggression
and, if aggression occurs, to halt it without devas-

Annex B.
tation or occupation of any Nam country. These
nations are also seeking to make the Atlantic
alliance an enduring association of free peo les,
within which all members can concert their e orts
toward peace, prosperity, and freedom.
The European Defense Community will form
an integral part of the Atlantic Community and
within this framework, will ensure intimate an
durable cooperation between the United States
forces and the forces of the European Defense
Community on the continent of Europe. I am
convinced that the coming into force of the Euro-
pean Defense Community Treaty will provide a
realistic basis for consolidating western defense
and will lead to an ever-developing community of
nations in Europe.
The United States is conﬁdent that, with these
principles in mind, the Western European nations
concerned will proceed promptly further to de-
velop the European Community through ratiﬁca-
tion of the European Defense Community Treaty.
When that Treaty comes into force the United
States, acting in accordance with its rights and
obli ations under the North Atlantic Treaty, will
con orm its actions to the following policies and
undertakings :
1) The United States will continue to maintain
in urope, includingJGermany, such units of its
armed forces as may e necessary and appropriate
to contribute its fair share of the forces needed for
the joint defense of the North Atlantic area while
a threat to that area exists, and will continue to
deploy such forces in accordance with a eed
North Atlantic strategy for the defense 0? his
area.
(2) The United States will consult with its fel-
low si atories to the North Atlantic Treaty and
with t 1e European Defense Community on ues-
tions of mutua concern, including the level 0 the
respective armed forces of the European Defense
Community, the United States and other North
Atlantic Treaty countries to be placed at the dis-
posal of the Supreme Commander in Europe.
(3) The United States will encourage the closest
possible integration between the European De-
fense Community forces on the one hand and
United States and other North Atlantic Treaty
