Let me remind you of a few of these facts. For
they are facts—based on the best available in-
telligence open to us from all our free world
sources.
Although the numerical strength of the Soviet
ground forces has remained fairly stable since 1947
at about 175 divisions, fully mobilized, there has
been a constant andsteady' increase in ﬁre power
and mechanization. Today, out of the total of
175 active divisions, no less than 65 are equipped
with tanks and motorized transport. Altogether,
the Soviet Union and the Eastern Euro ean cap-
tive states, including Eastern Germany, iave over
6 million men under arms, of which a proximately
4% million are in ground forces. Since 1947 the
armed stren th of the captive countries has been
almost doubled on Soviet orders. These forces
now amount to about 80 divisions.
But even without these satellite auxiliaries, the
U.S.S.R. has at its hand a ready spearhead for
a rapid advance into Western Europe. This spear-
head is composed of the 22 Soviet divisions perma-
nently stationed in Eastern Germany. The bulk
of these are armored divisions with nearly a com-
plete complement of tanks and self-propelled
guns. And to backstop this spearhead there are
60 more Soviet divisions stationed in the Eastern
European countries and the Western areas of the
Soviet Union itself.
The mobilization system for both the Soviet
Union and the Soviet-dominated area of Eastern
Europe is periodically tested for effectiveness.
We believe that within 30 days after the start of
mobilization the Soviet Union could muster 400
divisions ready for action.
Soviet air stren h has been stabilized at about
20,000 aircraft. ut the ra id increase in Soviet
air potential is reﬂected in tliieir change-over to jet
aircraft. Three years ago only about 20 percent
of the Soviet ﬁghter force was equipped with jet
ty e aircraft. By early 1954, almost all Soviet
ﬁg ters were jets. By this year, too, they have con-
verted well over two-thirds of their light bomber
force to jet aircraft. Jet models have been observed
in the heavy bomber class. Meanwhile Soviet
development of atomic weapons has gone forward.
This tremendous aggregation of military power
must always berkeptmtheforefrontrof ourpoli
thinkin" in? planning; These are the facts whic
go furt est to ex lain developments in the post-
war history of urope. Thus, the existence of
this monolithic Soviet power system in Eastern
Europe is the yardstick by which to measure the
true value of Soviet propaganda lines which their
diplomatic spokesmen and their propaganda ma-
chine have plugged so steadily. How much reliance
can we place in the professed peaceful objectives
of Soviet foreign policy when we see so much effort
devoted to building this vast military apparatus?
How sincere is the Soviet desire for East-West
trade when we know how strenuous have been
the Soviet efforts to orient the entire production
and commerce of the captive eoples in the direc-
tion of the Soviet Union? iat is the value of
a Soviet proposal for an all-round reduction in
armaments by one-third when even after such a
reduction the military strength at the disposal of
the Kremlin would still be preponderant't
The plain fact is that this system of Soviet
power which has been forcibly fastened on the
states of Eastern Europe, and the division of
Europe which has been its inevitable result, is
today, as it has been for the past 8 years, the main
threat to the security of Europe and to ourselves.
At times this threat may appear to grow alarm-
ing so that it is on everyone s minds and lips; at
0t 1er times it may seem to recede and to be over-
shadowed b other international events and prob-
lems. But however this threat may appear to us
at any given moment, the Soviet power base which
constitutes this threat is always growing.
Now, on have been hearing from other speak-
ers and iave been discussing in previous sessions
some of the measures that have been taken by the
Euro eans and by ourselves to organize the free
worl to meet and deter this threat. You have had
extensive discussions of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, that close-knit alliance of 14 Atlan-
tic nations which in itself, backed b our own
atomic capability, has been probably t e greatest
single deterrent to Soviet armed aggression in
Euro e over the past 4 years. You have also dis-
cusses Euro ean efforts to move toward closer
unity, not on in the ﬁeld of defense through the
creation of the European Defense Community,
but economically through the already-o )erating
Coal and Steel Communit and the uropean
Political Community, whic is eventuall to be
the directing political organism in all elds of
uniﬁcation.
All these efforts we have supported and encour-
aged, not only because they are steps toward in-
suring Europe’s protection a ainst the threat of
Soviet aggression, and there y contributing to
our own security but also because they are ood
in themselves. Ii‘or we believe that, even i b
some miracle the Soviet threat were to diminis
or disappear, unity in Europe is necessary to make
Europe viable economically and stable politically.
We must alwa s remember that so long as Europe
remains divi ed against itself, whether by a
Soviet Iron Curtain or by historic political rival-
ries and traditional economic separatism, so long
will Europe be a temptingly weak target for ag-
gression and a potential source of disturbance to
world peace.
It is at the heart of these efforts toward Euro-
pean integration to so alter the relationships be-
tween the European nations, particularly rela-
tions between France and Germany, as to make
im ossible any revival of those ancient hostilities
an frictions which led to two world wars. As
Secretary Dulles has so often pointed out, neither
the Europeans nor ourselves can afford to see re-
built in Europe the kind of ﬁretrap of nationalistic
