followed in a short time by other ste s. I, too,
thank American opposite numbers in t e negotia-
tions for the understanding and sym athy which
they have shown us in every phase ofp the talks.
E1120 Giacchero, Member of the High Authority
[Translation]
Mr. Secretary:
I am glad to be able to say a few words on this
solemn occasion, not so much because it enables me
to give an Italian voice to the expression of this
European principle that we re resent, but because
I would like to formulate an i ea that in my view
ought to be put forward today.
All those Europeans who, as I do, believe in and
work for the integration of the six countries of
the Community and for extension of this Com-
munity to other Euro an nations, have all un-
doubtedly drawn muc of their conviction from
the historical and political development of the
United States. Today, we can say that the United
States is not only at the root of our political in-
spiration (because modern federalist thought has
its main source in Hamilton, Madison, and Mar-
shall) but also that with the Agreement now just
signed the United States has given material sup-
porpfto the achievement of European integration
ltse .
I hope that at the end of the road our common
as irations will not be disap ointed and that it
W1 1 be clear to all even to t ose who today are
opposing us, that European unity is, if I am al-
lowed to paraphrase Abraham Lincoln, “the last,
best hope of Europe.”

and Congolese Securities
Press release 211 dated April 28
The Department draws the attention of U.S.
holders of certain securities issued in Belgium or
the Belgian Con o to the following notice drafted
pjy the Belgian overnment. The notice requires
.8. holders of such securities as were formerly
or are now on deposit in Germany to register these
securities by May 28, 1954, or else the securities
will be invalidated. It is believed that American
citizens and former Nazi persecutees, now resident
in the United States, may be affected by the notice.
A Belgian law of November 10, 1953, provides
for the registration of the Belgian securities in
those countries, e. g. in Germany, in which the
registration of these securities pursuant to the
decree-law of October 6, 1944, concerning the
Belgian and foreign securities has not yet been
carried out.
The securities covered by the law can only be
validated if it can be proved that they were sub-
May 3, i954
sequent to May 10, 1940, and without interruption
the property of
(1) Belgian nationals, nationals of allied or
neutral countries, or
(2) nationals of former enemy countries who
pursuant to the provisions of the law of July 14,
1951, concerning the sequestration and the liqui-
dation of German rights, assets, and interests were
granted removal of the sequestration.
In principle, the re 'stration extends to all
bearer securities regard ess of dcsi ation which
have been issued by public authorities in Belgium
or in the Congo area by Belgian joint-stock com-
panies, Belgian trustee associations, limited liabil-
1ty companies in the Con 0 area, and by the
association “Comite Nationa du Kivu.”
However, bearer bonds which have been issued
by Belgian public authorities or Belgian com-
panies are considered foreign securities and are
exempt from registration if they are denominated
in foreign currency. Applications are to be
handed to the Belgian Ministry of Finance, Serv-
ice du Recensement des Titres, Brussels, Rue Bel-
liars, at latest by May 28, 1954, and are to be

Friedrich-Wilhelmstrasse, by May 15, 1954.
The followin documents and data are to be ﬁled

1. An a plication signed by the holder of the
securities showing the name, Christian name, trade
nationality, and residence of the holder as weli
as of the custodian, if any, and quantity, exact
designation, and number of the securities;
2. All documents which serve the purpose of
proving that the above-mentioned securities were
actually deposited within German territorly on
October 7, 1944;
3. All documents which furnish proof that these
securitie sare actually the roperty of the named
holder from a date prior to ctober 6, 1944.
If the holder acquired these securities only sub-
sequent to May 9, 1940, he must produce the fol-
lowing documents:
(a) a list showing in chronological sequence the
names of all those persons to whom these securities
have belonged since the above-mentioned date;

shi ; and

of the securities actually was the owner on May 9,
1940.

speciﬁed on this list.
4. If the holder is a German national he shall
furnish a certiﬁcate from the Belgian sequestra-
tion ofﬁce to the effect that the s uestration cover-
