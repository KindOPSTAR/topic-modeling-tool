Mission to the Middle East
by E ric Johnston
Special Representative of the President1
I am most a preciative of the opportunity of
talking to you a out an undertaking of the utmost
importance to the people and the nations of the
Middle East. Since last October I have been en-
gaged in this undertaking as the representative of
the President of the United States. In a very
literal sense, I am a man with a mission; and it
is that mission which I would like to explain and
discuss with you fellow-friends of the Middle
East.
In this forum, I know there is no need to dwell
on the background of affairs against which the
aims of my mission must be viewed and evaluated.
All of you know the recent history of the region;
all of you are cognizant of the tensions and con-
ﬂicts which have produced instability and uncer-
tainty in the area; and all of you believe, I am
sure, that economic and social progress for the
peoples of the region will be neither swift nor sure
so long as tensions and uncertainty exist.
The task fgiven to me by the President and the
Secretary 0 State is intended to strike at the root
of some of the main causes of this tension and un-
certainty. My mission has a limited, speciﬁc, and
clear-cut purpose: To further a constructive pro-
posal for developing the physical and economic
resources of the Jordan Valley for the beneﬁt of
the people of four countries which have an inter-
est in the waters of that ancient stream and in the
lands through which it ﬂows. These countries are
Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Israel.
As you know, I have already made one visit
to those countries, and it is my intention to make
another in the near future. On the ﬁrst visit, I
am happy to say, I was able to enlist their interest
in the suggestions I advanced on behalf of the
President and the Secretary of State, and I am
deeply gratiﬁed by the serious consideration that
has been given them since then. While I recog-
nize that many difﬁculties lie ahead, I am looking
forward to my second visit with real hope that
the governments of the countries concerned will
perceive the advantages and beneﬁts inherent in

our roposal and ﬁnd it possible to cooperate.
Tiie Jordan Valley project—and I do not want
to call it a “p1an”—is embodied in a report re-
pared for the United Nations by an eminent rm
of American engineers, which envisions the con-
struction of irrigation and power works through-
out the valley of the Jordan from the headwaters
of the river in Lebanon, Syria, and Israel to the
Dead Sea. If the conce tion of comprehensive
valley development embodied in this report were
to become reality, it would bring the valley of the
Jordan literally into bloom, provide an economic
base on the land for hundreds of thousands of
people, start a ﬂow of electric energy into areas
where it is now totally unknown, and contribute
in many other ways to the economic and social
advancement of the peoples of the countries
concerned.
On the face of it, our support of these proposals
represents a considered step by the Government
of the United States, a step calculated to further
a constructive and forward-looking solution of
some of the problems with which the people of
the region are confronted. I am perfectly con-
ﬁdent that the basic conception is a sound one, a
fair one, and a reasonable one. I believe that it
offers a solid basis for real progress in an atmos-
phere relieved of some of the tensions and con-
ﬂicts which impede progress in the area at the
present time.
Now there are some in this country, and some
in the Middle East, who profess to see in our pro-
posals regarding the Jordan Valley certain
Machiavellian motivations. Perhaps this was
only to be expected in view of the tense political
situation which exists today between the Arab
States and the State of Israel. I am certain,
however, that any fair and considered analysis
of the proposal itself would quickly dispel all
such fears.
