violators would have been able to control the in-
spection; they would not have assured against the
hazards of violations or evasions.
Throughout 1949 and 1950, in the meetings of
the six permanent members of the U.N. Atomic
Energy Commission, we sought unsuccessfully to
overcome Soviet intransi ence in this ﬁeld. Si-
multaneously with these e orts in the atomic ﬁeld,
we have been trying to ascertain whether there
would be some means of reaching agreement with
the Soviet Union on reduction of armed forces and
the so-called “conventional weapons.” In 1947
the Commission for Conventional Armaments was
established by the U.N. with the same membership
as the Security Council. In that Commission the
United States introduced the plan of work which
was adopted by the Commission in 1947. In 1948
the United States, France, and the United King-
dom played major roles in developing an impor-
tant statement of the principles relating to the reg-
ulation and reduction of conventional armaments
and armed forces. In 1949, the Commission,
largely on United States initiative, developed pro-
posals for a census and veriﬁcation of armaments
and armed forces, which the Soviet Union
promptly vetoed in the Security Council. In 1950,
although the Soviet representative withdrew from
participation in the activities of the Conventional
Armaments Commission, the United States dem-
onstrated its interest in making progress by outlin-
ing general views on various safeguards in the
disarmament ﬁeld.
At that particular point, the efforts of the two
United Nations commissions were stymied by So-
viet refusal to discuss the issues and even to attend
the meetings. Following the United States ini-
tiative, the General Assembly established the Com-
mittee of Twelve in 1951, in order to see whether
progress could be made by combining the functions
of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commis-
sion and the Conventional Armaments Commis-
sion in a new and uniﬁed body. All members of
this Committee, except the U.S.S.R., agreed that
this course should be followed. The U.S.S.R. po-
sition was all the more difﬁcult to understand be-
cause it had in past years favored such a uniﬁed
approach to the disarmament problem.
On January 11, 1952, the present United Nations
Disarmament Commission was created by the
General Assembly on the basis of proposals made
by the United States, joined by the United King-
dom and France, which outlined the objectives and
the terms of reference of the Commission. The
Commission tried hard throughout 1952 to ﬁnd
ways of carrying out the tasks set for it by the
General Assembly. These efforts again failed be-
cause of Soviet intransigence. In these meetings,
the United States independently, or joined by the
United Kingdom and France, in effect presented
the broad outline of its views on a comprehensive
disarmament program which would include all
armed forces and all armaments, both atomic and
nonatemic.
We presented “Essential Princi les for a Dis-
armament Program,” to provide 0 jectives which
might guide the Disarmament Commission in its
work. We introduced proposals on a system of
progressive and continuing disclosure and veriﬁ-
cation of all armed forces and armaments, which
included atomic information from the outset.
Joined b the United Kingdom and France, we
suggests ﬁxing ceilings on the armed forces of
the Five Great Powers and all other states with
substantial military power which would have
meant great reductions in these armed forces.
The three Western Powers set forth their views
on how to prevent undue concentration of per-
mitted armed forces in the various military serv-
ices, and how to limit conventional armaments.
Finally, the United States explained how it be-
lieved bacteriological weapons should be elimi-
nated from national armaments as part of a com-
prehensive disarmament system.
You may recall that the Soviet Union preferred
to raise false char es that the United States had
used bacteriologica weapons in North Korea and
China rather than discuss how these weapons
might be eliminated in a general disarmament
pro am. This Soviet concentration on propa~
gan a, which was a lie in its inception and in
every other detail, was characteristic of the Soviet
approach to the problems discussed in the Dis-
armament Commission in 1952.
Des ite this record of frustration, the U.S. con-
tinu in every practicable way to demonstrate
this Government’s abiding desire for disarma-
ment. In 1953, this des1re was demonstrated
most concretely by four efforts. First, on April
16, 1953, President Eisenhower suggested that a
disarmament agreement could properly include
limitation, either by absolute numbers or by an
agreed ratio, on the military and security forces
0 all nations; an agreed limit on that part of
total production of certain strategic materials
devoted to military purposes; international con-
trol of atomic energy to insure the rohibition of
atomic weapons; limitation or prohi ition of other
categories of weapons of great destructiveness;
and enforcement of this program under adequate
safeguards, including a ractical inspection sys-
tem under the United Igations. The President
declared his readiness to ask the people of the U.S.
to join with all nations in devotin a substantial
percentage of the savings achieve by disarma-
ment for a fund for world aid and reconstruction.
He called upon the Soviet Union to demonstrate
concretely its concern for peace by deeds instead
of by words.
Second, Secretary of State Dulles in his open-
ing address to the United Nations General As-
sembly on September 17, 1953, emphasized the
U.S. desire for progress in relaxing international
tensions and this Government’s willingness to try
