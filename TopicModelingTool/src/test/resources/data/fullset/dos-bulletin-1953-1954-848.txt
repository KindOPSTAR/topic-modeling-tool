It was hoped that the growin shortage of for-
eign currencies mi ht be somewﬁat offset through
the revisions of ection 11 of Public Law 400,
82nd) Congress. This Act amends the Fulbright
Act by broadening the source of foreign curren-
cies and credits available for exchanges and other
purposes. For example it makes available not
only currencies acqulred as a result of surplus
roperty disposals, but also other currencies of
oreign governments “held or available for ex-
penditure by the United States or any agency
thereof . . . not required by law 0r agreement
with such Government to be expended or used for
an other purpose.”
ﬁowever, these currencies are also available for
other activities of the United States Government,
such as the Department’s administrative expenses
abroad, purchase and rent of foreign bui dings
and foreign currency expenses of the Defense De-
partment and other United States agencies. If
expenditures for these activities should exhaust
foreign credit balances due the United States, the
Department would be unable to buy such cur-
rencies from the Treasury Department even
though dollars might be appropriated by Con-
gress for this purpose.
Program Actlvltlcs and Accomplishments
Exchange programs under the Act were planned
and put into operation for the ﬁrst time in Ger-
many, Sweden, Ceylon, Finland, and the Union of
South Africa, with which agreements were si ned
in 1952. The program with Germany invo ved
the ﬁrst large scale movement of American stu-
dents to that area since the outbreak of World
War II. Foundations and Commissions in Scan-
dinavian countries pooled their knowledge and
experience in getting new exchange programs
quickly underway in Sweden and Finland. Ar-
rangements were worked out between these coun-
tries for the interchan e of American lecturers
and other grantees to ac ieve maximum program
effectiveness.
Altogether, exchange programs were carried
out with 25 countries involvm 1,606 American
and 2,576 foreign grantees. Inc uded were grants
to foreign students to attend American sponsored
schools abroad, such as the American University
in Beirut—long recognized as a bulwark of
American inﬂuence in the Near East.
These exchanges, representing an ex )enditure
of $7,303,075 in foreign currencies, coul not have
been carried out without the dollar assistance pro-
vided by the Smith-Mundt Act. Equally im-
portant was the ﬁnancial SIEPPOI‘t provided by
private and other non-U.S. wovernment groups.
Foreign currencies, for example, cannot pay for
grantees’ expenses within the United States, or
for program and administrative costs in this
country. Altogether, $2,500,000 was made avail-
able under the Smith-Mundt Act, $1,000,000 under
special programs for Germany, Austria and Fin-
land, and approximately $7,000,000 by non-U.S.
Government sources to achieve maximum utiliza-
tion of these foreign currencies for exchange
pur oses.

exchange program in each country: [See p. 891.]
To increase the effectiveness of grants to indi-
vidual students, teachers, lecturers and research
scholars, a number of projects were developed.
These included group projects, such as American
Studies Conferences and Seminars, in which all
categories of grantees as well as the general public
articipated; joint projects, such as the foreign
ecturer program in small American colleges,
which the John Hay Whitney Foundation ﬁnanced
jointly with the Department to enable outstanding
foreign lecturers to teach at lesser-known Ameri-
can educational institutions; and 8 ecial projects,
such as the one recently planned or South East
Asian journalists whereby they will spend two
months tourin the United States and attend a
special works op including lectures by out-
standing American journalists and political ﬁg-
ures arran ed by the American Press Institute at
Columbia University under a Rockefeller Founda-
tion grant.
American Studies projects were designed to
meet the increasing interest abroad in our history,
literature and culture for a better understanding
of our role in the world today. For example, one
of the outstanding developments of the year was
the increase in the number of short-term confer-
ences on American studies, which were held in the
United Kingdom, Norway, the Netherlands, Pak-
istan and India. A special grou project in
American civilization was arrange for teachers
from Denmark, Norway, France, Sweden and the
Netherlands at American universities.
American studies continued to be taught in for-
eign universities as a result of the ro am. A
recent example is the special chair 1n erican
literature and history established in Bel ium at
the University of Liége, to be ﬁlled annual y by an
American lecturer. Altogether, courses in Amer-
ican studies are now being offered at universities
in Denmark, Norway, Germany, Belgium, France,
India, Japan, Greece and Italy. In addition, in-
dividual American lecturers in the general ﬁeld
of American studies have been assigned to prac-
tically all of the 25 countries parti i atin in the
program, including critical Near an Far astern
areas.
Teacher exchanges are vital channels, not only
for reaching impressionable youth grou s abroad
who are groping for answers to the wor ’5 social
and political problems, but also for inﬂuencing
many important community groups. Altogether,
more than 271 American and 236 foreign teachers
were exchanged during this period. These ex-
changes included a teacher education project un-
der which foreign teachers visited the United
