Since the present Act expires on June 12, 1954, a
simple one-year extension will, of course, be re-
quired for t e interim period.
In addition to initiating hearings on the vital
subject of extension and amendment of the Trade
Agreements Extension Act, there is much else that
should be accomplished in this session of the Con-
gress to carry into effect the recommendations of
my Message of March thirtieth. The tax incen-
tives for foreign investment provided for in H. R.
8300 will, I am conﬁdent, become law shortly. I
look forward to enactment in this session of the in-
crease in the tourist allowance from $500 to $1,000
as provided in H. R. 8352, now pending before the
House Ways and Means Committee. It is my hope
that the Congress will shortly complete action on
H. R. 6584, dealing with customs valuation, a bill
which has already passed the House and is now
pending in the Senate Committee on Finance.
Simpliﬁcation of commodity deﬁnitions and rate
structures in the Tariff Act based upon a study by
the Tariff Commission, and a better method of clas-
sifying articles not enumerated in the tariff sched-
ules should be authorized. Improvement in the
statutes governing the administration of customs
procedures and changes in the anti-dumping law
and procedures to speed up its administration
should also, I believe, he provided at this session.
Accomplishment of these things now would rep-
resent substantial progress in which we all could
take satisfaction. With these ﬁrst steps behind
us, the Congress will be in a position early next
year to undertake immediate consideration of the
vital part of the program—the further amendment
and extension of the Trade Agreements Extension
Act. This overall program will provide the for-
ward motion in our country essential to progress
the world over in raising levels of proﬁtable trade
and investment. It is my deep conviction that in
this direction lies the greater security for America
that comes from a stronger free world.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Mr. Percy to the President
DEAR Mn. PRESIDENT! Since the meeting in your
ofﬁce on April 29th with a group of businessmen,
for whom I had the honor to act as spokesman, we
have found much interest throughout the country
in your foreign economic policy proposals that
went to the Congress on March 30th. We are per-
suaded that your sound and moderate program
represents an essential step toward the achieve-
ment of a higher level of trade and investment.
We believe, too, that there exists among all seg-
ments of the American people strong support for
your proposals. It is, of course, not yet articulate
to anywhere near its maximum degree. We are
conﬁdent, however, that careful consideration and
discussion will bring forth expression of that
support.
We, as citizens interested in this cause, wish to
be of assistance in our own communities in encour-
aging better understanding of the relationship of
your program to the welfare of our people and of
our friends throughout the free world. It would
be very helpful to obtain your views with respect
to the course ahead in translating your recom-
mendations into action.
We want you to know, Mr. President, that we
stand ready to sustain your leadership in this vital
matter in every way we can.
Respectfully yours,
CHARLES H. PERCY
