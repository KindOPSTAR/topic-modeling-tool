ﬁnal resolution adopted by the Migration Com-
mittee requestin governments to provide funds
in the amount 0 $3 million on a loan basis for a.
cash reserve. There was general acceptance by
the members of the Committee of the necessity for
establishing such a cash reserve during 1954.
Plans for 1955
In considering the roposed plan of operations
and the budget and p an of expenditure for 1955,
the Subcommittee on Finance and the Migration
Committee recognized that their action was of a
preliminary nature because of the necessary budg-
etary procedures of many of the government mem-
bers and that ﬁnal action on the 1955 bud et would
be taken at the next session. After muc discus-
sion an estimate of movement during 1955 totaling
156,700, including a movement of 50 000 to the
United States under the Refu ee Relief Act of
1953, was tentatively adopted. t was reco ized
that this estimate would uire a substantial in-
crease in the bud et of the ommittee and conse-
quently presente a challenge to the member gov-
ernments to increase their contributions. The esti-
mate of movement, however, appeared justiﬁed by
the current high rate of movement in 1954 and the
movements already planned and anticipated for
1955. An administrative budget of $2,491,728 and
an operational budget of $47,543,947, makin a
total budget of $50,035,675, was adopted sub ect
to ﬁnal review and determination at the eig th
session.
No commitments were made at the seventh ses-
sion b member governments with respect to their
contri utions for 1955. The Committee, however,
had knowled of the roposal currently under
consideration y the U. . Congress that the United
States contribution be $11,700,000 for that riod.
Assumin a United States contribution 0 $11,-
700,000, t e budget as tentativel adopted called
for an increase in contributions y other govern-
ments over their present contributions of
$6,949,281.
The Committee was interested to learn that sub-
stantial success had been achieved since the revi-
ous session in reducing the refugee population in
Trieste to below 3,000. In the same period the
movement of European refugees out of Shan hai
through Hong Kong to overseas countries 0 re—
settlement was proceeding at a slower pace. The
Australian and Netherlands representatives re-
ported to the Committee that special efforts would
be made during 1954 and 1955 to increase the
current movement of migrants from the Nether-
lands to Australia by 15,000 under special arrange-
ments requiring the full support of the Com-
mittee.
