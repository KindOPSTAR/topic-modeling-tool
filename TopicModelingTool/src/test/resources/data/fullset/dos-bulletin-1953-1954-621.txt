March 12, 1954
I herewith submit report number 76 of the United Na-
tions Command Operations in Korea for the period 16-31
August 1953, inclusive.
Marking of the Demarcation Line and the clearing of
hazards within the Demilitarized Zone continued under
the supervision of Joint Observer Teams. Both sides
agreed in principle that bone tide residents of the Demili-
tarized Zone would be permitted to move in and out of
the zone in order to maintain livelihood.
Early in the reporting period the Communists notiﬁed
the United Nations Command that personnel would be sent
into the Demilitarized Zone to engage in the construction
of facilities for captured personnel not to be directly repa-
triated. This was the ﬁrst ofﬁcial evidence that the Com-
munists would have non-repatriates. On 19 August the
Communists delivered a roster of deceased United Nations
Command military personnel. The total number reported
was 1,078. Agreement was later reached on a program of
recovery of bodies of deceased personnel from the Demili-
tarized Zone under the control of the other side.
By the end of the period the initial stages of organiza-
tion for the implementation of the Armistice had been
nearly completed. It is considered by the United Nations
Command that a satisfactory spirit of co-operation with
regard to implementation of the Armistice exists in most
areas.
Repatriation of captured personnel continued during
the period. As for the prisoners themselves, those in the
United Nations Command custody who desired repatria-
tion generally were docile and co-operative until they
approached the exchange point. As each group neared

Panmunjom, the returning prisoners, apparently by pre-
arranged plan and on order, gave startlingly similar per-
formances by discarding clothing, shouting, and throwing
various materials at United Nations Command oﬂlcials.
By 81 August, however, the United Nations Command
had returned to Communist control a total of 61,415
prisoners. By the same date, the following numbers of
United Nations Command personnel had been released
from Communist captivity:
United States _________________________ __ 2, 827
Other United Nations ________________ __ 1, 208

The Armistice Agreement provides for the formulation
of Joint Red Cross Teams wh0se function during the
repatriation is to provide "such humanitarian services as
are necessary and desirable for the welfare of the
prisoners of war." Early in the repatriation it became
apparent that those Communist members of the Joint Red
Cross Teams had missions not in consonance with the
Armistice Agreement. The Communists signed an oper-
ating agreement with their United Nations Command
Red Cross counterparts and then proceeded to complain
at every turn against implementation of its several pro-
visions. In practically every instance their complaints
and formal "reports" were pure propaganda. As a result
of these Communist tactics, any real service which might
have been rendered the prisoners in United Nations Com-
mand custody was prevented. Also, meager reports from
teams operating in North Korea left no doubt that those
Joint Red Cross Team members were seeing only what
the Communists wanted them to see and were performing
their “humanitarian services" only insofar as Communist
policy permitted.
In spite of all the unnecessary handicaps the United
Nations Command proceeded in good faith with the imple-
mentation of the Armistice Agreement.
United Nations Command Ground Forces continued to
re-estahlish themselves in new defensive positions south
of the Demilitarized Zone. Intensive training activities
were engaged in by all units, designed to maintain a high
state of morale and combat readineSS. United Nations
Forces continued to support, logistically and otherwise,
the various agencies created under the terms of the Armi-
stice Agreement. Aid and assistance was also provided
