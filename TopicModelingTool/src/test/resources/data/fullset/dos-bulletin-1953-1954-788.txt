UNESCO is ﬁghting illiteracy by training teachers

In 1953 over 8 million children were vaccinated
against tuberculosis, and almost 20 million pro-
tected against malaria through DDT spra ing in
various country campaigns conducted y the
World Health Organization and the United Na-

treated for the tropical disease of yaws.
In Southeast Asia, through the Food and Agri-

Last year, right here in Miami, there was a meet-

worke out improved designs for fishing boats
which will increase the efﬁciency of ﬁshing opera-

These are only a few random examples of the
work of the specialized agencies. They are not
giveaway projects. They are primarily designed
to help people help themselves. Because we think
that is a sound idea, we are major supporters of
the United Nations Expanded Technical Assist-
ance Program—a program ﬁnanced out of volun-
tary contributions of member countries to promote
economic development. We have made it clear
that we are willing to join with other nations in
diverting to economic development a portion of
the funds which will be saved if we can put into
effect an agreement for reducing armaments.
Being a good neighbor in the modern world is
nothing more than sound common sense. The end
result of American know-how, American food,
American money, American equipment, wisely
spent in United Nations enterprises around the
world—when added to our own purely national
programs—is certainly all to the good in terms
of our national interest. It gives people some-
thing to ﬁght for as well as something to ﬁght
with. It builds markets and cuts down the need
for direct American aid.
The Soviet Record
Let me contrast for you now the record of the
Soviets in the economic work of the United Na.-
tions. It is a record which bears careful study
in the light of recent Soviet moves.
In Dumbarton Oaks and in San Francisco, when
the charter was hammered out, the Russians
showed little interest in the establishment of any
economic organ within the United Nations. This
negative attitude toward the work of the Eco-
nomic and Social Council and other constructive
activities designed to improve the economic state
of the world has been the consistent policy of the
Soviet Union.
The Soviets have in the past ignored, opposed
or sought to frustrate the economic actiV1t1es of
the United Nations. This did not stop the Soviet
delegates from talking in various Unlted Nations
bodies concerned with economic matters. In fact,
they did more talking than any other dele ation.
But they used these bodies as sounding cards
for propaganda to attack the way of li e of the
free countries. They used these bodies to extol
the alleged virtues of the Soviet economy. Their
)erverswn and twisting of facts was matched only
y the persistency of their pro aganda. At the
same time, they even refused to urnish the United
Nations with the most elementary data about con-
ditions in the Soviet lands.
The Soviets never contributed one red ruble to
the Expanded Program of Technical Assistance
or to the United Nations Children’s Fund. They
re fused membership in the International Bank, the
International Monetary Fund, the United Nations
Food and Agriculture Organization, the Interna-
tional Labor Organization, and UNESCO. For a
short while they did belongl to the World Health
Organization, but they wit drew early in 1949.
What was the reason for this noncooperation
and obstructionism? The answer is clear: Com-
munist propaganda ﬂourishes on misery and want.
Communist leaders are bound to try to undermine
any efforts on the part of the free world to improve
standards of living, particularly in the underde-
veloped countries of Latin America, the Middle
East, and Asia. For any such improvement was
bound to weaken the appeal of Communist
demagogues.
It was against this background of Soviet ob-
structionism and noncooperation that the chief
Russian dele ate surprised the members of the
Economic an Social Council last August by an-
nouncing a conditional offer of the U.S.S.R-. to
contribute 4 million rubles, or $1 million, to the
Technical Assistance Program of the United Na-
tions. This offer was shortly followed by similar,
though very much smaller, offers from Poland and
Czechoslovakia. It was only after the United
