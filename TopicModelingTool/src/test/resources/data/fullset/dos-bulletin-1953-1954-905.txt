other American States just as much as it does
the United States, and it is not a problem which
the United States regards as exclusively a United
States—Guatemala problem.
If the United Fruit matter were settled, if they
gave a gold piece for every banana, the problem
would remain just as it is today as far as the
presence of Communist inﬁltration in Guatemala
lS concerned. That is the problem, not the United
Fruit Company. And this articular problem be-
tween Guatemala and the 'nited States equally
prevails as between Guatemala and a number of
other States which are seriously threatened or
would be seriousl threatened if communism, in
the words of the Caracas Resolution, gets control
of the political machinery of any American State.
As was said at Caracas, that would be a danger to
all the American States and threaten the peace of
this hemisphere. Therefore it is not just a ques-
tion between Guatemala and the United States.
Beneﬁts Extended to OAS
White House press release dated June 3
The President on June 3 signed an Executive
order1 entitling the Or anization of American
States to the beneﬁts of t e International Organi-
zations Immunities Act. Since February 19, 1946,
the Pan American Union has been designated as
being entitled to the privileges provided by the
International Or anizations Immunities Act. The
present designation supersedes this earlier desig-
nation, and the order expressly provides that the
designation of the Organization of American
States shall be deemed to include the designation
of the Pan American Union.
The International Orggnizations Immunities
Act, which was approved ecember 29, 1945, pro-
vides that certain privileges, exem tions, and im-
munities shall be extended to sue public inter-
national organizations as shall have been desig-
nated by the President through appropriate
Executive order, and to their oﬂicers and em-
ployees and the representatives of the member
states to such organizations.
The Organization of American States has de-
veloped over a period of more than 60 years
through treaties, resolutions, and recommenda-
tions of meetings of representatives of the Ameri-
can Republics from the ﬁrst meeting at “lashing-
ton, D.C., in 1889, to the Ninth International Con-
ference of American States at Bogota, Colombia,
,in 1948. The Charter of the Organization of
American States, an inter-American treaty rati-
ﬁed by the United States on June 19, 1951, was
signed at the Bogota Conference and came into
effect on December 13, 1951.
‘ No. 10533; 19 Fed. Reg. 3289.

During most of its history the Organization,
which is now the Organization of American States,
was known by the name “Pan American Union.”
The Organization of American States consolidates
and integrates the various entities of the Inter-
American System. Under the charter, the Pan
American Union continues as the central, erma-
nent organ and General Secretariat of the rgani-
zation of American States.
Sale of Ships to Brazll
Statement by Charles P. Nolan 1
I believe that there should be no doubt that the
economic develo ment of Brazil is in the national
interest of the nited States. The dollar value
of our trade with Brazil has increased very greatly
in recent years, in fact over ﬁve times since 1940.
Brazil expects to earn over 1 billion dollars in
1954, which it will use to buy United States prod-
ucts and repay dollar obligations. Thus, Brazil
represents a very important growing market for
United States industry.
The size of Brazil and the distribution of its
population along the coast makes Brazil Uniquely
dependent upon coastal shipping. The coast is
over 5,500 miles long and 85 percent of the popu-
lation lives within 100 miles of the ocean. There
are 33 major and many smaller ports. Coastal
shipping carries 45 percent of the total interstate
commerce of Brazil, between the 18 States (in-
cluding the Federal District). The six Northern
States and the two Southern States, with almost
half the population of the countr , de end upon
coastal s ipping to carry over t ree- ourths of
their total interstate commerce. The rail and
highway transportation to these northern and
southern extremities is very inadequate.
The present Brazilian coastal ﬂeet is com
of 307 vessels of 609,000 dead weight tons. me
of these vessels are 60 years old, and over 65 per-
cent are more than 30 years old. Less than 30
of the ships may be considered as modern, efﬁcient
vessels for coastal trade.
S. 2370 is part of a shipping program between
this Government and the Government of Brazil.
In 1952, the situation with respect to the shipping
trade between the United States and Brazil was
bad with a number of acute unsolved problems
‘ Made before the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Com-
mittee of the House of Representatives in support of S.
2370. authorizing the sale 01' certain vessels to Brazil, on
June 8 (press release 307). Mr. Nolan is oﬂlcer in
charge. transportation and communications, Bureau of
Inter-American Aﬂalrs.
