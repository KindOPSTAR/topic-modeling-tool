to deprive the ople of Viet-Nam of their inde-
pendence by su jecting them to the new imperial-
ism of the Soviet bloc.
What is going on in Indochina is a perfect ex-
ample of the Soviet Communist strategy for
colonial and de ndent areas which was laid down
by Lenin and talin many years a 0 and which
the Communists have practiced to ta e over much
of Asia.
The Indochina area was vulnerable. The Gov-
ernments of Viet-Nam, Laos, and Cambodia had
not yet received full political independence.
Their peoples were not adequately organized to
ﬁght against the Communist-led rebels, and they
did not feel that they had a stake in the struggle
which justiﬁed great sacriﬁce.
President Eisenhower became familiar with the
roblem when he was the Supreme Commander of
NATO in Euro e. He had seen the strain and the
drain which t ie Indochina war put upon France.
He was aware of the owing discontent in France
resulting from the ong war where the French
were assuming the principal burden of the ﬁght
and where human and material costs were mount-
mg.
I recall in December 1952 when General Eisen-
hower, as President-elect, was returning from his
Korean trip on the cruiser Helena, we discussed
gravely the problem of Indochina.
We realized that if Viet-Nam fell into hostile
hands, and if the neighboring countries remained
weak and divided, then the Communists could
move on into all of Southeast Asia. For these
reasons, the Eisenhower administration from the
outset gave particular attention to the problem of
Southeast Asia.
Our efforts took two complementary lines. We
sought to strengthen the resistance to communism
in Indochina. YVe sought also to build in South-
east Asia a broader community of defense.
lndochlna Measures
In Indochina itself, the following steps seemed
to us important:
1. The French should 've greater reality to
their intention to grant fulﬁllinde endence to Viet-
N am, Laos, and Cambodia. his would take
away from the Communists their false claim to be
leading the ﬁght for independence.
2. There should be greater reliance upon the
national armies who would be ﬁ htin in their
own homeland. This, we believe , coulgd be done
if the peo les felt that they had a good cause for
which to ght and if better facilities for training
and equipment were provided for them.
3. There should be greater free-world assistance.
France was carrying on a struggle which was
overburdening her economic resources.
Much progress was made in each of these re-
spects. The French declaration of July 3, 1953,
pledged full independence to Viet-Nam, Laos,
and Cambodia. Already, a treaty of independ-
ence has been concluded with Laos, and Emperor
Bao Dai told me, in Paris, 2 weeks ago, that
he felt that Viet-Nam was assured of its
independence.
On the military side, a 2-year plan was worked
out by General Navarre. It was designed to speed
the training of native forces.
The cost of this operation would be consider-
able. The United States, which was already ay-
ing part of the cost of the war, agreed to ear
the greater part of the total cost. We are now
paying at the rate of about $800 million a year,
plus a very large provision of military equipment.
Despite the gains on these fronts, there has been
a growing belief by the French people that France
was overextended, in view of its responsibilities
in Asia, in Africa, and in Europe. As a result,
when I met in Berlin last January and February
with the Foreign Ministers of France, Great Brit-
ain, and the Soviet Union, the French Govern-
ment asked that the projected conference on Korea
be ex anded to discuss also the problem of peace
in In ochina.
Shortly after the Berlin Conference adjourned,
the Communists, as was to be expected from them,
began to expend their military assets, human and
material, in a desperate effort to win some victory
which they would exploit for political purposes.
The concentrated on a mass assault against one
of the French outposts—that of Dien-Bien-Phu.
That assault was pushed with a callous disregard
of human life.
Now, Dien-Bien-Phu has fallen. Its defense,
of 57 days and nights, will go down in history
as one of the most heroic of all time. The de-
fenders, composed of French and native forces,
inﬂicted staggering losses on the enemy. The
French soldiers showed that they have not lost
either the will or the skill to ﬁght even under the
most adverse conditions. It shows that Viet-Nam
produces soldiers who have the qualities to enable
them to defend their country.
An epic battle has ended. But great causes
have, before now, been won out of lost battles.
The Chinese Communists have been supplying
the forces of Viet Minh rebels with munitions,
trucks, anti-aircraft ns, radar, and technical
equipment and technical advisers. They have,
however, stop ed short of 0 en intervention. In
this respect, t ey ma have en deterred by the
warnings which the United States has given that
such intervention would lead to grave conse-
quences which might not be conﬁned to Indochina.
Colleetlve Defense
Throughout this period the United States has
also followed the second course of trying to de-
velop strength in Southeast Asia through col-
lective measures.
