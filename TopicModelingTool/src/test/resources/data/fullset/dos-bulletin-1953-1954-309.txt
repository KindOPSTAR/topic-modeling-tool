sible opportunity for individuals to develop their
talents and exercise their initiative; (2) the main-
tenance of a competitive society; and (3) the bless-
ing of a broad, free, internal market for our goods
and services. If these factors are the sources of
our strength, we would do well to adhere faithfully
to them as we play our part in the international
economy. This faith dominates the report and
motivates many of its recommendations.
With this philosophy as its background, the re-
gort commends a series of policies for the United
tates which, taken all together, might move all
nations slowly to a world in which international
trade stands at high levels, currencies are readily
interchangeable among nations, and governmental
interference in international trade and payments
is at a minimum.
Some of these movements would be achieved
through changes in this country’s trade policies,
assuming there were like actions on the part of
other nations. For instance, we would ne otiate
with other countries for some moderate an grad-
ual reductions in our tariff levels over the next 3
years, in return for trade concessions on their art.
Ve would negotiate also to reconstitute the ien-
eral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as an organ-
ization, so that it could serve even more effectively
as a forum for improving international trade re-
lations and facilitate the operation of our world-
wide trade agreements.
We would amend our “Buy American” policy-—
the policy of requiring Government agencies to
favor domestic roducers in the procurements of
their supplies; instead, we would allow a foreign
bidder greater opportunities to sell to our Govern-
ment agencies in com etition with domestic bid-
ders, particularly w ere the foreign bidder’s
Government extended like privileges to Ameri-
cans. We would maintain the merchant marine
at the level that our national security required, but
we would do so by direct subsidies rather than by
the practice of requiring half of our government-
ﬁnanced cargoes to be carried on our own rela-
tively hi h-cost shi 8. And we would take a great
many ad ed steps, eyond the signiﬁcant measures
already taken over the past few years, to stream-
line our customs administration.
The all-important and hi hly controversial sub-
ject of tariffs and trade po icy quite naturally is
studied at great length. The Commission states
that the oral and written submissions in this ﬁeld
exceed in the aggregate all those relating to other
ﬁelds considered. More than a dozen individual
recommendations are offered in the ﬁelds of Buy
American Act—tariff classiﬁcation revision—cus-
toms simpliﬁcation—renegotiation of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade with subsequent
submission to the Congress, to name but a few.
And it is in this ﬁeld that dissents are made in
varying degrees.
The Commission does not conﬁne itself to rec-
ommendations in the ﬁelds of international trade
and services. Its mandate was, in effect, to review
the entire foreign economic policy of the United
States and it accepted this mandate literally. To
the astonishment of most people who fo lowed
its work, the Commission during its brief active
life succeeded in surveying the whole ﬁeld. The
Commission’s report has some signiﬁcant recom-
mendations on such problems as the nature of our
foreign-aid programs, the problem of stimulating
international investment, the place of interna-
tional commodity agreements, the problem of
achievin convertible currencies, and various
other critical subjects.
The Commission’s recommendations on foreign
investment are in keeping with the main themes
of its report. Due to the interest of you invest-
ment ofﬁcers, perhaps I should enlarge a bit on
the approach to foreign investments and the con-
cluding subject of convertibility.
l-‘orolgn Investments and Convertlblllty
American interests and world conditions today
call for an outﬂow of capital from the United
States to the backward areas of the world. We
must, however, rely principally on private sources
to supply this capital. These sources will supply
the capital only if they can earn a competitive
yield, can be reasonabl secure from the risks of
political instability, an can be reasonably assured
of the right to brin their earnings home. It is
for the country whitili wishes to attract American
capital to bring about these conditions. The Com-
mission feels, however, that the United States
might also assist in encouraging foreign invest-
ment by gi'antin certain tax concessions on for-
eign earnin s an by experimenting with a limited
program 0 guarantees for overseas investments
against nonbusiness risks. The tax study is al-
ready under way.
The Commission asks when dealing with the
subject of convertibility, how can we move toward
a world in which governments do not have to 1i-
cense their imports in order to ration their scarce
supplies of gold and dollars? And how can we
return to a world in which people who earn ster-
ling or francs or guilders or lira can be sure of
their right to turn their holdings into dollars, or
other foreign currencies whenever they wish?
The Commission feels we are in a position to make
regress toward this kind of world—not spectacu-
ar plrogress, perha s, but a steady movement
whic will reestablis some of the freedoms in in-
ternational trade of which the world has seen so
little since World War II. The Commission feels
that the resources of the International Monetary
Fund might well be more fully mobilized to sup-
port such an effort and suggests, under the proper
circumstances, our own Federal Reserve System
might be able to provide some limited access for
the central banks of other countries to added re~
serves of gold and dollars.
