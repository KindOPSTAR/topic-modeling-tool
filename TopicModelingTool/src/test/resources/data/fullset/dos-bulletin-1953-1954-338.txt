act wisely on the basis of his forecasts, and he must
never forget to have his rubbers and his raincoat
handy even when the diplomatic forecast is “fair.”
A diplomat is seldom faced with only two pos-
sible courses of action; the opposite of what is
wrong is not necessarily right. He must generally
choose between a great variety of possible courses
and, like a canoeist in a mountain torrent, must
show skill in avoidin hidden rocks even after he
has chosen his channe . Outsiders coming into the
State Department are astounded at the pains we go
to to make sure we have not overlooked something.
It is easy for critics to excoriate our actions.
Since we generally must choose between evils, it is
easy to show that our choice was bad. Admitted;
but was there a better one? Amid all the destruc-
tive criticism you read of our diplomacy, how often
do you ﬁnd anything truly constructive? Even
when they suggest another course, critics have no
responsibility to act as they recommend—and to
live with the results. The ublic quickly for ets

If the make a mistake, no one cares; if a diplomat
does, is country may suffer grievous harm.
A ﬂash of genius which misﬁres may shatter
years of patient work, and years of irreproachable
diplomacy may not wipe out the effects of one
blunder. The diplomat has no deadline to meet
and no public to attract, but he does have the
national interest to uphold. He is not playin
a big-league game to the frenzied applause o
massed spectators. He must sift and analyze the
information from every source available to him;
he must ponder what it means, and he must de-
cide wisely what to do. He must often face
agonizin decisions. He cannot act like a 10-
year-old y thinkin u world-shatterin inven-
tions. It will take all that he has in intelligence,
knowledge, and experience to come up with the
best answer, and he is understandably irked by
backseat drivers.
W'hen a di lomat gets hit by critical mudballs
it is practically imposible for him to make a real
re ly. I recently noted, for example, a lengthy
editorial lambasting a speech of mine which the
paper in question had not even mentioned in its
news columns. Obviously, in a name-callin con-
test with his critics, a diplomat hasn’t a fair c ance
to get his story before the public. But even if
his story were printed, how much could be say?
He cannot betray conﬁdences. He cannot reveal
secret information, often obtained from secret
sources. He cannot cackle in triumph over a
good deal he has made, or his opposite number in
another country will be on the spot and he will
pay plenty when he next tries to negotiate. He
cannot criticize a friendly country or its repre-
sentatives—he and his country must continue to
live with them. He cannot, with propriety,
criticize another part of his own government, even
if it is to blame. He cannot shush the press even
when it inexcusany insults a foreign country or
reveals his entire diplomatic ker hand by shrilly
telling him how to play it. Hi: cannot blame ub-
lic opinion for a vital earlier decision whic it
prevented, or compelled him to make—and, popu-
ar belief to the contrary, history tells of many,
many times when public opinion was hopeless y
in the wrong. The diplomat often cannot even
reveal his true objectives, which may subtly en-
visage a third count or a future move on the
diplomatic chessboa . Thus, when forced to
answer criticism, he generally uses a string of
soothing four-syllable words which ma mean
something to other diplomats but deﬁnitely don’t
to the general public.
Our critics often cr for some diplomatic vic-
tories. The fact is t iat there is nothing more
disastrous than a diplomatic victory. Austria-
Hungary won a diplomatic victory in the Bosnia-
Herzegovina affair in 1908 and 10 years later
disappeared from the ma ). Hitler won a dip-
lomatic victory at Munici in 1938 and died 7
years later in the ruins of Berlin. The little
clique of self- rpetuating tyrants in the Kremlin
mi ht proﬁt y their example. The only real
d'plomatic victories are those which beneﬁt both
arties. How many Americans can identify the
ush-Bagot Agreement, or tell what James G.
Blaine contributed to inter-American relations?
Yet the agreement was the true beginnin of our
new indissoluble friendship with Cana a; and
Blaine, by summoning a Pan American Confer-
ence in 1889 in terms still fresh, laid the corner-
stone for the present inter-American relation-
ships which contribute so mightily to our national
security.
Pollcla Slow To Change
Critics also often accuse di lomats of havin
no policy, and recommend al sorts of radica
steps. .If there is one thing that history shows,
it 13 that national interests change slow] if at
all and national policies should be equally slow
to change. Russia has displayed the same aggres-
sive tendencies alike under czar and commissar.
En land has scarcely had a foothold on continen-
tal urope in 5 centuries, yet has fought in every
major continental war in that entire period—to
prevent any one power from dominating the Con-
tinent. However much we may have wished to
avoid it, we have found world leadership thrust
upon us by a similar reason—we cannot permit
ag ressive dictators to overrun the world. The
on y real question is, how are we to accomplish
this? Let me particularly point out that domes-
tic elections do not change our national interests.
A new administration can try new tactics, but it
will disregard the underlying realities of the na-
tional interest only at its, and the Nation‘s, peril.
We shall not achieve peace and security by scur-
