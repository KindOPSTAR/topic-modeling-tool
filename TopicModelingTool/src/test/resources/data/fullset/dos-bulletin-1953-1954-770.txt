provided with heavy colored glasses and thin veils for
protection against dust storms. The laborers did not
have any such facilities.
I was horriﬁed. After all, a human being is not a beast.
Even for reconstructing a country he should not be used
as a tool of convenience.
Just a little more of Mr. Shastri’s account:
Most of the laborers there had been imported from
distant places; even if they wanted, they were not al-
lowed to give up their present jobs to try for new ones
elsewhere. The Communist party of China and Chairman
Mao Tse-tung had decreed employment for all; perhaps
it is enforced labor like this that has in the West pro-
voked descriptions like “labor concentration camps” and
“forced labor."
Perha s criticism may be leveled at the fact
that in th Communist China and Albania the
instances of forced labor cited and the laws under-
lying the forced labor programs date back 2 years
or more. Perhaps some of you may be tempted
to say this is all old information. Do not yield
to that temptation. For this is new—this is a
monster whelped in our time and nurtured to
dragon proportions since the end of the last war.
It is, moreover, a monster in the image of the
Kremlin, set loose anew in each land that has been
enslaved. Even now it is awaiting license to roam
the Associated States of Indochina.
The means we employ to present the facts of
forced labor to the world must be those which are
most productive of efﬁcient operation. The work
of the Ad Hoc Committee has laid a solid founda-
tion for that which lies ahead. There is merit to
the proposition that the Committee’s life be con-
tinued. The United States is prepared to support
a pro )OSiil of this kind. It 1s our view that we
must ave an expert mechanism to evaluate evi-
dence placed before the United Nations on the
existence of forced labor. At an appropriate
later date, the United States Government may
wish to lay such proposals before the United
Nations.
For the present, however, the continuation of
the exploration that has been begun, on the basis
of the solid principles established by the Com-
mittee, can well be entrusted to the Secretary-
General of the United Nations and the Director
General of the International Labor Organization,
acting jointly.
Purposes of Joint Resolution
The joint resolution which we have introduced,
together with the delegations of Ecuador, France,
Norway, Turkey, and the United Kingdom, car-
ries out this thought. It provides, in paragraph
5 (b), for the submission of new information, of
whatever type, on systems of forced labor, whether
de jure or de facto. It permits information to be
submitted by responsible sources—member gov-
ernments, specialized agencies, and nongovern-
mental organizations in consultative status. Gov-
ernments concerned are given an opportunit to
comment on the informatlon thus submitted. he
resolution further provides for the inclusion of
this information, together with any comments
that governments concerned may have submitted,
in a report to be made to the 19th session of this
Council.
I want to make quite clear the nature of the
report which the joint resolution before the Coun-
cil would authorize, and also what this resolution
does not authorize.
The language of the resolution is carefully
chosen. It envisages a report based on new in-
formation. This would exclude a re-presentation
of the material in the Ad H 00 Committee’s report.
It envisages a report based on information, and
not on unsupporte allegation.
It envisages a report dealing with system of
forced labor, in the sense that such systems were
deﬁned and elaborated by the Ad H 00 Committee.
It does not envisage a report which includes in-
formation on a great many other matters. To he
s eciﬁc, this resolution does not authorize the in-
c usion of—and I am going to borrow a phrase
and use it where it is really a plicable—of “slan-
derous and provocative” irrelevancies similar to
those which the Ad Hoc Committee dismissed.
The responsibility for preparing a careful re-
port of this character is a heavy one. I am sure
that the Secretary-General and the Director Gen-
eral of the International Labor Organization will
carry out their responsibilities in a manner that
will make their report a notable addition to the
work begun by the Ad H 00 Committee.
The resolution also asks for the cooperation of
governments who have not replied to the question-
naire the Committee sent them. This is an im-
portant step in the gathering of further informa-
tion on forced labor and carries out the desires of
the Eighth General Assembly. Such information
would also be included in the report of the Sec-
retary-General and the Director General of the
International Labor Organization.
But even while we continue to explore the facts
further, we must not weaken in our condemnation
of those inhuman practices which have been so
forcefully brought to our attention. The resolu-
tion before the Council unequivocably condemns
forced labor and, following the Ad Hoc Commit-
tee’s recommendations, appeals to governments to
reexamine those laws and practices which have
occasioned this inquiry.
The United Nations has been characterized as
the conscience of the civilized world. I earnestly
commend adoption of this resolution as a signal
that that conscience is awake.‘

‘ The resolution (U.N. doc. E/L 588/Rev. 1) was adopted
by the Economic and Social Council on Apr. 27 by a vote
of 13—2 (Czechoslovakia, U.S.S.R.)—3 (Egypt, India,
Yugoslavia).
