Soviet policies have been changed with the passing
of Stalin. Indeed, the Berlin conference of last
February gave positive evidence to the contrary.
The Soviet Communists have always professed
that they are lanning for what they call “an
entire historical) era.”
The assets behind this threat are vast. The
Soviet bloc of Communist-controlled countries—
a new form of imperialist colonialism—represents
a vast central land mass with a population of 800
million. About 10 million men are regularly
under arms, with many more trained millions in
reserve. This land force occupies a central osi-
tion which permits of striking at any one of about
20 countries along a perimeter of some 20 thou-
sand miles. It is su plemented by increasin air
power, equipped w1th atomic weapons, ab e to
strike through northern Arctic routes which bring
our industrial areas in range of quick attack.
The threat is not merely military. The Soviet
rulers dis ose throughout the world of the ap-
paratus ofinternational communism. It operates
with trained agitators and a powerful propaganda
organization. It exploits every area 0 discontent,
whether it be olitical discontent against “colonial-
ism” or socia discontent a ainst economic condi-
tions. It seeks to harass t e existing order and
pave the way for political coups which will install
Communist-controlled regimes.
* By the use of many types of maneuvers and
threats, military and political, the Soviet rulers
seek gradually to divide and weaken the free na-
tions and to make their olicies a pear as bank-
rupt by overextending tlIfem in eifbrts which, as
Lenin put itZ are “beyond their strength.” Then
said Lenin, ‘our victory is assured.” Then, said
Stalin, will be the “moment for the decisive blow.”
It is not easy to devise policies which will
counter a danger so centralized and so vast, so
varied and so sustained. It is no answer to sub-
stitute the glitter of steel for the torch of freedom.
An answer can be found by drawing on those
basic concepts which have come to be regularly
practiced within our civic communities. There
we have almost wholly given up the idea of relyin
primarily on house-by-house defense. Instea ,
primarily reliance is placed upon the combining
of two concepts, name , the creation of power on
a community basis an the use of that power so
as to deter aggression by making it costly to an
aggressor. The free nations must apply these
same principles in the international sphere.
Communlty Defense
The cornerstone of security for the free nations
must be a collective system of defense. They
clearly cannot achieve security separately. No
single nation can develop for itself defensive
power of adequate scope and ﬂexibility. In seek-
ing to do so, each would become a garrison state
and none would achieve security.
This is true of the United States. Without the
cooperation of allies, we would not even be in a
pos1tion to retaliate massively against the war in-
dustries of an attacking nation. That requires
international facilities. Without them, our air
strikin power loses much of its deterrent power.
\Vith t em, strategic air power becomes what Sir
\Vinston Churchill called the “su reme deterrent.”
He credited to it the safety 0 Europe during
recent years. But such power, while now a domi-
nant factor, may not have the same signiﬁcance
forever. Furthermore, massive atomic and ther-
monuclear retaliation is not the kind of power
which could most usefully be evoked under all
circumstances.
Security for the free world depends, therefore,
upon the development of collective security and
community power rather than u on purely na-
tional potentials. Each nation w ich shares the
security should contribute in accordance with its
capabi ities and facilities. The Inter-American
Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (Rio Pact) of
1947 set a postwar example in establishing the
principle that an armed attack against one would
e considered as an attack against all. The
North Atlantic Treat is based on the same prin-
ciple. Its members ave gone much further in
organizing joint forces and facilities as a part of
the integrated security system. NATO provides
essential air and naval bases, to which its various
members can contribute—each according to its
means and capabilities. It provides the planes
and ships and weapons which can use these bases.
It provides so many oints from which an aggres-
sor could be harassed), in so many different ways,
that he cannot prudently concentrate his forces
for offense against a sing e victim.
While NATO best exempliﬁes this collective
security concept, there are other areas where the
same concept is evolving, althou h as yet in a more
rudimentary form. An exampi is the Western
Paciﬁc, where the United States has a series of
collective security treaties which now embrace
Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Japan,
and Korea. Collective arrangements are now in
the making in the Middle East, with Turkey-Pak-
istan as the nucleus. These developments show
the growing acceptance of the collective security
concept we describe.
The United Nations is striving to make collec-
tive security effective on a basis broader than
regionalism. The central principle of the charter
is that any armed attack is of universal concern
and calls for collective measures of resistance.
The Soviet Union, by its veto power, has made it
impractical, as yet, to make available to the
Security Council the “armed forces, assistance,
and facilities” contemplated by article 43 of the
charter. When aggression occurred in Korea,
however, the principle of collective action was in-
voked by the United Nations and acted on by more
460
