consult together in order to resolve “the practical
questions relatin to Berlin”.
I must in the rst lace point out that certain
of the proposals whic I made to you do not re-
quire any consultation or prior discussion of this
kind. This is the case, for instance, with regard
to the abolition of police controls and the removal
of the barriers erected at inter-sector borders.
There are at present in the U.S. sector no police
controls on the movement of persons between the
U.S. sector and the other sectors. As for the bar-
riers erected at the inter-sector borders, all those
which were former] in existence in the U.S. sector
have been removet long ago. The same steps
have been taken in the British and French sectors.
It requires therefore only a decision by the au-
thorities of the Soviet sector in order to eliminate
these obstacles to freedom of movement. I shall
be glad to learn that you are ready to take the
necessary steps to put such a decision into effect
as soon as possible.
The solution of other questions mentioned in my
letter of February 22 could, on the other hand, be
facilitated by discussions between German tech-
nical experts who would make preparations for
puttin the proposed measures into effect. It was
with t is in mind that I offered to furnish on
with the names of the experts authorized to eal
with these measures with respect to my sector. I
hope that you for your part will agree to nomi-
nate experts for the purpose of participating in
such technical discussions, and I renew my pro-
posal that we should meet together in order to
draw up jointly the terms of reference required
so that these discussions may begin without delay.
“Soverelgnty” of East Germany
Statement by Lincoln White
Department Press Ofﬁcer ‘
The reported proclamation [on March 25] of
“full sovereignty” of the “East German Peoples
Republic” is sheer facade. If these reports are
true, the signiﬁcant fact is the last one reported:
That Soviet occu ation troops would remain in
East Germany. I? those troops were removed, the
entire pup et regime would collapse under the
weight of the hatred and hostility of the populace
which it has the eﬂ'rontery to claim it represents.

2. he pur ose of the meeting was to provide an
opportunity or United States and Canadian Min-
isters to examine the trade and economic problems
that are common to both countries.
3. The Ministers noted that the ﬂow of trade be-
tween Canada and the United States is greater
than that between any other two countries. They
discussed various aspects of present trade rela~
tions and agreed on the desirability of avoiding
any action which would interfere with this trade
from which the two countries derive such great
beneﬁts.
4. Since the common economic problems of
Canada and the United States can be solved with
greatest success in a world where the volume of
trade is steady and increasing and where exchan
arran ements are of a kind to facilitate sug
growt , consideration was given throughout the
discuss10ns to the need for action toward freer
trade and payments on a broad front. It was
agreed that few things would contribute more to
the well-being and stability of the free nations of
the world than a forward move in this direction.
The need for such progrem seemed all the greater
at a time when many Western countries are faced
with the necessity of supporting effective defense
programs over a long period.
