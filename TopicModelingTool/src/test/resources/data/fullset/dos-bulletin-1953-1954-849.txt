States for six month periods, studying and observ-
ing American school systems; teacher inter-
changes, whereby American and foreign teachers
were enabled to trade positions in their respective
school systems for a full year; and summer semi-
nars abroad for American teachers, such as those
held last summer in France and Italy for teachers
of French and Italian languages and cultures.
An important part of the teacher program is
the trainin of forei teachers in English teach-
in meth s. A wi er knowled e of English not
on y helps to remove language arriers to inter-
national understanding but also hel s to awaken
and maintain interest in American 1i e. This pro-
gram included English language traininv of for-
eign teachers in this country, the hofding of
teacher seminars in foreign countries to review
En lish teachin methods, source materials and
pub ications, an the sendin of American teach-
ers abroad to conduct Englis classes for teachers
and students. Typical of the latter was the Amer-
ican teacher in Thailand who, noting her students’
interest in the American presidential elections,
arranged for a mock convention in English.
Through such methods as these she not only hel (1
her students to improve rapidly their Engiigh
langua e ﬂuency, but to increase their understand-
ing of t e United States.
A new development in the program was the ex-
tension of grant opportunities to non-academic
ersons, such as Japanese labor leaders, South
ast Asian journalists, and German government
ofﬁcials. These projects were made possible by
the decision of the Board of Foreign Scholarships
to include foreign specialists whose programs are
carried out in cooperation with approved educa-
tional institutions. '
In carrying out their studies teaching and re-
search, American grantees often have oppor-
tunities to undertake additional community
activities which extend their inﬂuence beyond the
classroom. In the United Kingdom, for instance,
an American student pursuin his studies in the-
ology at the UniverS1ty of dinburgh, has also
spent some of his free time on clerical work in a
poor Edinbur h district, where he preaches and
visits regular y the church’s parishioners. In
Italy, an American research scholar won the re-
spect and liking of a large circle of friends, includ-
ing shopkeepers, workers and artisans, in carry-
ing out a sociological study of an Italian village.
