your advancement from the secondary school was
ased not only on scholarship and aptitude but on
your “political reliability.” This prime factor
shows up in your record as a Youn Pioneer and,
later, as a member of the Komsomo , the Commu-
nist organization for older youths.
Even selectin a profession is not your choice.
It is determineg by the manpower needs of the
state at the time. And, once enrolled in engineer-
ing, medicine, or law, you ﬁnd that a. major part
of your study is not devoted to the technical aspect
of your major subject. Instead, it includes fur-
ther study of the Marxism-Leninism philosophy.
The point is that your continuance in any pro-
fessional school depends not on your professional
abilities but on how successful you are in conform-
ing)to the teachings of communism.
nce a graduate, you are still not free to pursue
the practices of your profession where your op-
portunities are better. You, too, virtually become
an indentured servant of the state for a period of
at least 3 years. And you, too, must acce t the
assignment or go to jail. Once on the jo , you
cannot leave it without the permission of your
superiors.
Two of the young men we are honoring toni ht
are successful doctors; one is a scientist. ow
would you have fared in your professions behind
the Iron Curtain?
Note ﬁrst that doctors in the Soviet Union
comprise a. very low-paid professional group.
Three-fourths of them are women.
In your training for medicine there, you must
ﬁrst accept the scientiﬁc doctrines as reinterpreted
by Marx, Lenin, Stalin. The medical student, or
the student of science, must never be guilty of
objectivity in his approach to a medical or scien-
tiﬁc problem. Often, in the midst of your career,
an accepted doctrine may be thrown out as being
“bourgeois” or “cosmopolitan.” Thus the stu-
dent must be ready to reverse his own ﬁndings
immediately and to practice the new scientiﬁc and
medical Party lines.
Under the Communist system of socialized med-
icine, a physician is bogged down in obligations
to the state. He must take care of patients in a
state clinic or a hospital at a ﬁxed wage. That
stipend is barely enough to support his family,
yet he has little time for private practice.
You, as a doctor, mi ht manage to see a few
patients of your own. ut, mainly due to state
taxes on so-called outside income, only 2 percent
of Russian doctors enjoy any private practice.
A Political Career In the U.S.S.R.
Consider another rofession. Tonight we are
honoring the young overnor of Tennessee for his
outstandin political achievements, his service as
a public 0 cial.
Governor Clement, how would your political
career have turned out in Russia? As you know
well, you would have had no choice there as to
party affiliation. There is but one party under
communism.
As a potential servant of the Party, on must
have carried out every injunction to t e letter.
For instance, if you were married in a church
your political career would end abruptly at that
pomt.
No member of the Komsomol who participates
in a church service is considered a loyal Commu-
nist youth. \Vhat’s even worse, it is expected that
you marry a member of the Komsomol in good
standing.
So you want to run for oﬁicel Well, selectin
a place for vou on the Party ticket will de en
entirely on the whim of the local Party chie ain.
Assuming you have become what he re ards as a
good Communist, and if your record s ows you
are making good as a Communist, you may be
“chosen” as a candidate for some ofﬁce.
At its grassroots the Party duplicates, checks,
and even vetoes the work of most government ad-
ministrators. So it is often a better political status
in the Soviet Union to be a district Party secretary
than to be the head of a local government agency.
Whether Party oﬁicial or Party and govern-
ment ofﬁcial, your big reward will come when,
and if, you are selected to the Supreme Soviet.
That is the political plum. And, holdin it, you
have no independent political judgment, or there
has never been one single “no” vote cast in the
Supreme Soviet.
Your tenure in the Supreme Soviet may be short,
however, because to stay there you must never
make an opposition speech, you must always vote
“yes,” and you must support the winning faction
in each election.
The Communlst Farmer
Now let’s take a look at Billie Sol Estes’ chances
for success in agriculture, were he in Russia.
This one thing is clear: His achievements as
farmer, stockraiser, landowner, and businessman—
at the age of 28 in the State of Texas—would be
im ossible under the Communist system.
The onl way he could get ahead on a Soviet
farm would be to turn to the political side of
farming. He must be a politician ﬁrst, a farmer
second.
He must also attract attention to himself. He
does this in the U.S.S.R. by joining the local Party
unit on the collective farm, by reporting on his
neighbors to the Party, by becoming a Party agi-
tator at harvest time, and by attending Party
lectures at the close of each working day.
He must readily adapt himself to support every
farm policy of the Party—policies which in over
35 years of practice have failed completely. For
Stalin insisted that collectivization was the key
to a successful agricultural production and that
the Soviet Union would surpass the free world in
