Geneva Conference Begins Discussions on Indochina
Following are the texts of statements made by
Under Secretary Smith in the ﬁrst and second
plenary sessions of the Geneva Conference on
ndoehina, on May 8 and May 10, together with
a draft resolution introduced by the F rench dele-
gation on May 8.-
STATEMENT OF MAY 8
The U.S. delegation takes this opportunity to
recall that at Berlin, the United States joined with
France, the United Kingdom, and the USSR.
in agreeing to organize a conference at Geneva to
consider the problems of Korea and of Indochina.1
Subsequently, the same four owers reached agree-
ment as to the composition 0 the Indochina phase
of the Conference, an agreement reﬂected in the
presence here today of the nine delegations in this
all. As in the case of the Korean phase, there
are only four inviting powers, the United King-
dom, France, the United States, and the USSR.
Therefore, if, as has been stated in press reports,
the invitation issued to the so-called Democratic
Republic of Viet-Nam appears in the name of both
the USSR and the Communist Chinese regime,
that invitation is, in its form, at variance with the
clear understandin of the Foreign Ministers pres-
ent at Berlin last ebruary. Assuming the press
reports to be accurate, the U.S. delegation can only
regret that the Indochina phase of this Confer-
ence should be initiated by a procedural evasion
of previously reached agreements.
At Berlin we agreed that “the problem of restor-
ing peace in Indochina” would be discussed at this
Conference “to which representatives of the
United States, France, the United Kingdom, the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the Chinese
People’s Republic, and other interested states will
be invited.”
At Geneva the four inviting powers have agreed
that in addition to the participation speciﬁed at
‘ Burn-ms 0! Mar. 1, 1954, p. 318.
Berlin there should be representatives at this Con-
ference of the Governments of Laos, Cambodia,
and Viet-Nam, and of the Viet Minh.
The United States cannot agree to the sugges-
tion which has just been made that nonexistent
so-called overnments or states, such as the so-
called Pat iet Lao or Free Cambodians, can in any
way be considered as qualifying for invitations to
this Conference under the Berlin agreement.
The United States proposes that any idea of
inviting these nonexistent so-called governments
be rejected. If there is opposition to this United
States proposal, the United States suggests this
meeting be adjourned to allow for further dis-
cussions on this point between the four inviting
powers.
STATEMENT OF MAY 10
The U.S. dele ation warml welcomes the pro-
posals made an accepted this afternoon for the
evacuation of the long-suffering wounded of Dien-
Bien-Phu and hopes sincerely that this evacuation
will be effected without delay.
Regrettably, for the subsequent 2 hours of our
session we listened to a remarkable distortion of
the events of the past few years in Indochina. The
Viet Minh spokesman ’ is well trained in the Com-
munist technique of distorting histor and calling
black white. The world has learne to evaluate
such spurious allegations. The charges made
against the United States by the Viet Minh re re-
sentative are substantially identical with t ose
made by other Communist representatives during
the opening phase of the Korean discussion. The
have been already amply and adequately refute ,
and I see no reason to divert this Conference from
its important task by according them further at-
tention at this time. I cannot refrain, however,
from commenting on his remarkable effrontery in
describing the brutal Viet Minh aggression against
Cambodia and Laos as a movement of “liberation.”
