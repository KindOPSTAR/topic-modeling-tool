this country last year has been introducing a num-
ber of new ideas since his return home, including
citizenship training as part of the curriculum of
a newly constructed agricultural school and a
wholly revolutionary idea of inserting in the
county newspaper at the end of the ﬁscal year a
report showing the county’s income and ex-
penditures.
These ties with the free world are also being
stren hened by building lasting contacts with
the ’nited States. In 35 countries there are
alumni associations which bring together students
and others who have studied in the United States.
On an individual basis the followin examples
come to mind: An Indian who studie industrial
relations in the United States has been solely
responsible for organizing the Division of Indus-
trial Relations in the Tata Institute in Bomba .
He distributes pamphlets for the American Fe -
eration of Labor and cooperates with their local
representatives as well as with re resentatives of
American business ﬁrms in Bom ay. A leading
dental surgeon in Indochina or amzes showings
of U.S. Information Service ﬁ ms in his spare
time and uses our materials for feature articles
and pamphlets. He has kept up his membership
in the American Dental Association and has or-
ganized a Vietnamese Dental Association as well
as a free medical and dental clinic where Ameri-
can methods are introduced.
The exchange experience is also making clear
the essential difference between the democratic way
of life and that of the totalitarian regimes, and
in this way strengthening the resistance of the
people of these countries to aggressive communism.
As one European specialist said :
I had always been afraid of Russian imperialism. Not
until I visited your country did I learn to believe in
the United States as a supporter of all the good and
culture supporting ideas. If you invite people from other
countries to visit the U. S. A., you can make your passive
friend your active ally.
A Japanese legislator told of his understanding
in this way:
I realized from this trip that the essential difference
and disagreement between Communist Russia and the
United States is that the former represents a way of life
by compulsion and the latter represents a way of life
which is based on and derives its strength from volun~
tary processes. The American way is Just and proper for
human society.
And lastly, exchanges are increasing our under-
standing of other countries. We learn about other
countries from ﬁrsthand contact with the citizens
who come to this country and through the experi-
ences of every American grantee who goes abroad.
It is signiﬁcant to note that about 30 percent of
the Americans who go abroad each year are work-
ing in some branch of the social sciences. Their
jobs, therefore, bring them very closely into con-
tact with the workings of cultures other than our
own. A number of these people are working di-
rectly with the area studies programs of several
of our large universities, and their overseas assign-
ments are proving of tremendous value to the
carrying out of these rojects.
These are a few of t e things that are resultin
from the ﬁrsthand experiences with America an
Americans which the exchange rogram affords.
Any endeavor which deals witi people as this
one has its quota of problems and its occasional
failures. However, our work in this ﬁeld over
the past 10 to 15 years has given us a fund of
useful experience on which we are constant]
building. There are two important ways in whic
all of you can help: First, by seeing that able and
well—qualiﬁed Americans know about the oppor-
tunities offered under this program so that we
can constantly improve the ca iber of our American
grantees. And second, by helping any foreign
visitor who may come to our community to get
as clear and well-balancedya picture of us as you
can possibly 've him. In this way we will build
11 a constant y increasin stream of eyewitnesses
w 0 can, in the words 0? the President, “submit
evidence to peoples of other nations . . . that
the ob'ectives and policies of the United States
are in armony with and will advance their legiti-
mate aspirations for freedom, progress and peace.”
