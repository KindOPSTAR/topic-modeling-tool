Administration of Tanganyika
Statement by Mason Sears
U.S. Representative in the Trusteeship Council‘
U.8./U.N. press release dated March 0
Up to now the Council has been dealing with
West Africa, where rogress toward self-govern-
ment is making political history. Today we turn
to Tanganyika in East Africa, several thousand
miles away.
Here we ﬁnd very different but e ually chal-
lengin circumstances in the march of a territory
towar self-determination. Here some of the
most attractive peoples in the world are closing
the gap which has separated them so long from
life in other continents.
In giving our views on this territory we wish to
start with a statement by Secretary Dulles. It
was made in Venezuela last week. “The United
States,” he said, “recognizes that free-
dom and independence [are] based not only on
political and moral considerations but also on eco-
nomic and social well-being.” '
These words are made to order for present-day
Tan anyika, where social and economic progress
are t e cornerstones of political advancement. In
this territor social and economic development
is closely tie to better housing and better pay for
its growing labor population.
It also happens that unusually signiﬁcant de-
velopments took place in both these ﬁelds within
the year. In the ﬁeld of housing we understand
that in Dar Es Salaam a new process for building
low-cost, hygienic houses was successfully de-
veloped. These houses, which are made of
treated clay and concrete, are said to rent at the
extremely low rate of less than $1 per month per
room. Nearly 2,000 of them have already been
erected.
This new building process will be twice welcome
if it prevents the appearance in Tanganyika of
those huge industrial shack towns which are breed-
ing crime and racial violence in other parts of
Africa.
In the ﬁeld of economics the important sisal
industry of Tanganyika has started a pension
system for its African workers. This offers the
worker a lifetime job and permanent settlement
on an industrial estate with a garden large enough
to raise the basic food for his family. In return
it gives industry a trained workman who is willing
to put in a full day’s work.
Previously, the African laborer was given little
or no incentive. All he wanted was to work long
enough to earn his small but tax. Then he went
back to his but in the bushes.

This shifting back and forth between job and
bush and the consequent low productivit of labor
is described by some as a part of the “r ythm of
Africa.”
For our part, we do not believe this to be a fair
description. And what is more, we understand
that the sisal industry itself is beginning to regard
the low roductivity of Africans as just a natural
result orthe mistake of management in failing to
provide an incentive for its workers.
Mr. President, we have mentioned only housing
and wages. \Ve might have mentioned more, but
these serve our purpose. They show that Tan-
ganyika is becoming a laboratory for successful
experiments which are greatly beneﬁting its
nearly 8 million people an even those beyond its
borders. For this, the British administrators de-
serve great credit.
