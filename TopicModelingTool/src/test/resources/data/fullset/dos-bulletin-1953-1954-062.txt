I herewith submit report number 74 of the United Na-
tions Command Operations in Korea for the period 16—31
July 1953, inclusive. United Nations Command com-
muniques numbers 1677—1639 provide detailed accounts
of these operations.
From the 16th of July until the Armistice was signed
on the 27th of July, there were executive sessions each
day except for the 17th and 18th days of the month. There
was an executive plenary session on the 16th, and on the
19th day there was both an executive plenary session and
an executive liaison oﬂicers session. From the 20th day
through the 28th there were executive sessions daily of
both liaison and start oﬂicers except on the 22nd day when
there was a staff oﬁicer session only and on the 23th and
26th days liaison oﬂicers meetings only.
On 19 July the Communists made public a statement
relative to the implementation of the Armistice Agreement.
The United Nations Command noted the statement and re-
serl'ved the right to discuss the Communist statement pub-
lic y.
Discussions during this period concerned reaching
agreement as to the effective date of the Armistice; re-
vision to the Draft Armistice Agreement, Military De-
marcation Line and Demilitarized Zone; preparation of
the documents, including maps; Temporary Agreement
Supplementary to the Armistice Agreement; and arrange-
ments for the signing of the Armistice.‘
On 26 July 1953, General Mark W. Clark, Commander in
Chief. United Nations Command. announced that at 2: 05
P. M. that date, United Nations Command and Communist
delegates reached agreement on the terms of an armistice.
In connection with the signing of the armistice, General
Clark made the following statement:
“In order to speed the conclusion of the armistice and
thus prevent additional casualties which would result from

further delay, and because of unacceptable restrictions
demanded by the Communists as a condition to the appear-
ance at Panmunjom of their commanders, it has been
agreed that none of the commanders will sign the Armis-
tice Agreement at Panmunjom. Instead, both sides have
authorized their senior delegates to sign the nitreelncnt at
Panmunjom at 10 o'clock, Monday, 27 July. Twelve hours
from that time the armistice will become effective.
“In accordance with the agreed upon procedure, the
documents signed by the delegates at l’anmunjoln will be
dispatched immediately to the headquarters of the respec-
tive military commanders for their signatures. I shall
sign the documents at my advance headquarters at Mun-
san-ni."
Liaison oﬂicers of the United Nations Command and
Communists reached agreement in executive session at
Panmunjon on the 26th of July on details pertaining to the
signing of an armistice and set 10 A. M., July 27, as
the time and date for the signing.
On 27 July 1953. a military armistice between the United
Nations Command and the armed forces of North Korea
and Communist China was signed initially at 10 A. M.
at Panmunjom, Korea, by Lieutenant General William K.
Harrison. Jr., representing the United Nations Command
and General Nam II for the Communist forces.‘ The doc~
uments to be signed by the Commander in Chief, United
Nations Command were then returned to Munsan-ni,
where they were signed by General Mark W. Clark. The
armistice became effective at 10 P. LL. 27 July 1953.
Even though armistice negotiations were culminated
in an agreement during this period. strongly Communistic
prisoners of war in United Nations (‘ommand custody
made last minute eiTorts to create difﬁculties for their
captors. As is often the case, the prisoners in the Koje-do
complex created all the disturbance. \‘arious compounds,
obviously on order of their prisoner of war leaders. con-
ducted drills, shouted. clapped their hands and conducted
frenzied chants in violation of long standing instructions.
In one instance, a United Nations Command enclosure
commander was attacked.
There were detected during this period unmistakable
signs that the non-repatriate prisoners remaining in United
Nations Command custody were becoming increasingly
apprehensive about their ultimate fate. Particular em-
phasis, therefore, was placed on presentation of factual
data to these non-repatriates to point out the safeguards
guaranteed them by the Armistice Agreement. Initiation
of this program met with immediate success in allaying
fears and apprehensions of this category of prisoners and
contributed in large measure to the maintenance of order
in their camps.
