for the civilian populace by United Nations Command
military forces.
Pursuant to the Armistice Agreement, the United Na-
tions Naval Forces were directed to cease hostilities and
blockade operations; to perform certain initial tasks; to
maintain an alert state of readiness, and to comply with
the letter of the Armistice Agreement.
The largest task in connection with the Armistice Agree-
ment conducted during this period has been the transport-
ing of prisoners of war from United Nations prisoners of
war siockades to Inchon.
As of 31 August 61,415 Chinese Communist and North
Korean military prisoners of war and civilian interneee
had been delivered to the exchange site. It is presently
planned to complete embarkation of all repatriates on 3
September. The debarkation of these repatriates will
take place on 5 September.
There have been no serious incidents reported during
this period. Mutuaily planned and agreed on daily quotas
have been met with only minor problems. Typhoon
“NINA” delayed operations of 16, 17 and 18th. However,
lifts began again on the 19th and normal operations re-
sumed. It is tentatively planned to commence the ﬁnal
phase of operation “BIG SWITCH” on 8 September. In
accordance with these plans the lift of Chinese Commu-
nist non-repatriate prisoners of war from Mosulpo to
Inchon will commence on that date. Two thousand will
be lifted daily for seven consecutive days, then approxi-
mately two hundred seventy on the eighth day. The lift
of North Korean non-repatriate prisoners of war from
KoJe-do to Pusan will commence on or about 9 September
with ﬁve hundred being lifted the first day and one hun-
dred fifty the following day.
United Nations Naval aircraft continued to conduct
intensive training exercises while maintaining an alert
state of readiness.
On 27 September 1952 Commander in Chief, United Na-
tions Command established a Sea Defense Zone for the
purpose of preventing attacks on the Korean coast; as
curing the United Nations Command sea lines of com-
munication and preventing the introduction of contraband
or entry of enemy agents into Republic of Korea territory.
This zone which extends around the perimeter of Korea
has remained a United Nations Naval responsibility since
it was established. In order to observe both the letter
and the spirit of the Armistice Agreement Commander
in Chief, United Nations Command suspended this zone on
25 August with the reservation that it may be reinstated
at any future date depending on the military situation.
The Military Sea Transportation Service and merchant
vessels under contract provided personnel lifts and logis-
tics as required for the United Nations Naval, Air and
Ground Forces.
United Nations Command Air Force units which were
committed to the Korean War continued to expand their
training operations as the ﬁrst month of the Armistice
passed without major incident. These training ﬂights are
designed to maintain the pilots and crews at a high degree
of combat readiness in the event hostilities should be
resumed.
Air Sea Rescue units were constantly alerted to perform
search and rescue missions for missing aircraft, shipping
and personnel.

Some 2,000 Korean, United States, and United Nations
ofﬁcials attended the ceremonies. Czech and Polish mem-
bers of the Pusan Team of the Neutral Nations Super-
visory Commission were also present.
