the coalition as well as of the Social Democrats
(the op osition) are men who do not hesitate in
their 11 lic speeches to condemn the Nazi regime
and t e internal as well as the foreign policy of
Hitler.
But in eneral, the eyes of the Germans today
are focuse not on the past but on the future; and
this future they envisage as something different
from anything in their ast. If one deﬁnes a
rogressive as a man who ooks toward a new and
better future and a reactionar as one who looks
longingly to the past, then I think it would be fair
to say that the revailing attitude in the German
Federal Repub 10 today is a progressive attitude.
Certainly there are few reactionaries who are long-
ing to turn back the clock of history.
When I ﬁrst arrived in Germany early in 1953,
I was amazed to ﬁnd how widely the plans for
European integration were being discussed and
with what degree of conﬁdence the German lead-
ers looked forward to the development of a new
Europe. To be sure, the spokesmen for the Social
Democratic Party, the opposition party, oppose
the formation of a European Defense Community,
but being democratic and oriented toward the
“Test, even they have their lans for close mili-
tary and economic cooperation between a large
group of Western European nations.
The city of Passau last summer arranged a festi-
val of which the main theme was the development
of a European community of nations. An one
who had suggested an assembly to talk a ut
Euro ean integration in 1925 would surel have
been geclared a visionary fanatic. It may e that
the German enthusiasm for the ideal of a united
Euro e is somewhat less today than it was 18
months ago; the slowness with which the ratiﬁca-
tion of the Eco treaty has proceeded has had a
somewhat chilling eifect on the enthusiasm of some
of the most Euro ean-minded leaders of German
opinion. It is a so true, and in view of the un-
precedented character of the project not surpris-
ing, that difﬁculties are now beginnin to appear
in connection with the Coal and Steel Community
which are bein given considerable publicity, but
in spite of bot these negative factors, it seems
that the ideal of a new sort of future for Europe
still has eat vitality for a surprising number
of people in the Federal Republic. Reports which
have come to me from several sources indicate
that the young people of Germany are, for the
present at least, really enthusiastic about going
forward with plans for a close military, economic,
and political integration of the six nations who
signed the Eco treaty and are now part of the
Coal and Steel Community. Moreover, the agree-
ment just signed by this Government to extend a
loan of $100 million to the Coal and Steel Com-
munity,2 I hope will galvanize German and West

Euro ean interests and rove a timely shot-in-the-
arm or what is still t e most important single
venture in the ﬁeld of European economic co-
operation. The year 1954 appears to be one of
those years in European history when there is a
tide running in a direction which we Americans
can only regard as being the right direction.
l/Vhether this tide will be taken at its ﬂood is still
admittedly uncertain.
Each one of you has probably his own version
of the history of the last 50 years and is ready to
defend his own particular thesis as to the ori 'ns
of World War I, the failure of the Versai les
Treaty, the rise of Hitler, and the subsequent
disaster of World War II. My own inter reta-
tion is that the Weimar Republic was foun ed on
shiftin sands. The violence of the years 1919
and f0 lowing, in which German assassinations,
street ﬁ hting, and putsches pla ed an impor-
tant ro e, furthered the growth of political
reaction. Many turned their eyes to the nation-
alistic and militaristic ideals of the period from
1870 to 1914. Therefore when the forces created
by the great social catastrophe of inﬂation and un-
employment and the failure of the victors in
World War I to carry out a wise and prudent
policy staged a series of revolutionary olitical
events, nationalistic and militaristic idea s-—-reac-
tion in short—came to the fore embodied in the
person of Adolph Hitler.
I recall this bit of history to your minds for the
pur ose of contrast. If I am right, the number
of Germans today who envisage the future of their
country in terms resembling the period of imperi-
alistic glory is very sma . Toni ht, I refuse
to be prophet, therefore if some 0 you are in-
clined to say, ah I, but the German mood may
change, I can only repeat that the diﬂ'erence in at-
titude between 1954 and 1925 is a difference not of
de ree but of kind. And after all, we mortals can
on y predict the future in terms of the facts of
the present and the past.
The Dlvlded World
Of course the fundamental difference in Ger-
many and throughout the free world today
between the present agonizing period in which we
live and the relatively tranquil times of the 1920’s
reﬂects the basic fact that we live in a divided
world in an atomic age. For the people of Ger-
many since 1945, the existence of a divided world
has been ever resent before their minds. Since
the Berlin bloc ade, no German could question the
fact that the Iron Curtain was being moved west-
ward to the line of the Elbe River. This fact,
coupled with the utter destruction of most Ger-
man cities and the complete collapse of all Ger-
man governmental structures on VE—Day in 1945
has meant that the Germans since the end of
World War II have been literally struggling for
their existence. The day-to-day task of merely
