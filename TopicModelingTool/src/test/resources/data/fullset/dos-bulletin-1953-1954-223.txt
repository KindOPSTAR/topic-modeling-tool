ities seeking a place in the sun, and the vast dis-
content of the millions who have learned that
poverty and disease are no lon er the inevitable lot
of all but a small privileged c ass. There the fa-
natics have found their chance. Those who in a
healthy society would be mere harmless cranks
and misﬁts have been able to ex loit the vast
physical, spiritual, and intellectua unhappiness
of our era to build brutal, terroristic totalitarian-
isms characteristically combining immense mili-
tary forces and dreams of world domination with
fantastic dogmas of self-justiﬁcation.
It is in the disillusionment and despair of so
many human beings that the fundamental danger
lies, that the real challenge exists for those with
the means of alleviating to some degree the condi-
tions that make for such disillusionment and de-
spair. It is in this endeavor we believe that J a an
can in time ﬁnd its most im ortant mission. he
Japanese, with their pro uctive capacities and
their technical and scientiﬁc skills, have the poten-
tial of contributing importantly, as we have tried
to contribute, to relieving the largely voiceless
despair of the hundreds of millions of Asia and
of helpin them to build a tolerable and rewarding
future. To make headway in this task will strain
the resources of the free eoples. Japanese re-
scuices of mind and skill) cannot be dispensed
Wit .
In speaking of Japan’s role as a great industrial
nation—or our role for that matter—I do not
mean to suggest that for all ills there are material-
istic solutions. What I do contend is that when
we bring peace to those who have lived amid the
terrors of war and riot, when we bring medicines
to those who are sick and food to those who are
hungry, there is never any question in our hearts
that we are engaged in a great work with a mean-
ing and consequences transcending the material.
Japan's Economic Situation
What J a an can contribute in the future must
obviously epend on her state of health. The
facts about Japan’s economic situation stand out
in bold relief and are doubtless already well known
to you. The recovery of Japanese production has
been one of the outstanding phenomena of the
postwar years. It is now 50 percent more than it
was in 1940. On the other hand, there is the
alarming situation of Japanese trade. Japan
must import 20 percent of its food. Last year
there was a failure of the rice crop in Japan.
Very little more rice was produced in 1953 than in
1934, when there was also a crop failure. But
when in 1934 the po ulation of Japan was 60
million; now it is 8? million. Last year the
greater part of what Japan earned by selling her
products abroad went to buy food from abroad.
With the continuing increase in Japan’s popula-
tion, the abnormal conditions of 1953 may become
normal.
It is, of course, not in food alone that Japan is
unable to supply her own needs. Japan is lacking
in most of the natural resources required by an
industrial nation, articularly coal and 1ron.
These must be also bought from abroad. Japan
must sell abroad in increasing amounts, but Ja-
pan’s exports have been shrinking. Last year
apan’s exports and its earnings from its shipping
amounted to about $11/3 billion while its im orts
stood at over $2% billion. Almost nine-tent s of
the difference was made up by U.S. expenditures
in Japan incident to the Korean war and the sta-
tioning of American troops in Japan. Such ex-
penditures by the United States will not go on
indeﬁnitely, owever. The plain fact is that J a-
pan is livin beyond her earnings from normal
sources by a out a billion dollars a year. Japan
must sell much more abroad. If she is unable to
do so we shall be back in 1930—with differences
that are apparent to us all.
Trade with Communist China is not the answer.
If all restrictions were removed, we believe such
trade would only slightly affect Ja an’s commer-
cial deﬁcit; and to the extent that apan su plied
strategic goods to augment Communist hina’s
war potential—which is what the Chinese Com-
munists want—Japan would be sowin the whirl-
wind. For above anything else, the C inese Com-
munists would like to undermine or overpower
Japan.
It is also not enough to say that Japan can ﬁnd
a natural trading partner in Southeast Asia. Cer-
tainl Southeast Asia needs Japanese manufac-
ture oods. It is buying them at the rate of
severa hundred million ollars a ear. This
amount could, of course, be increased y devices to
tie Southeast Asia’s econom to Japan. But these
are out of the question. apan’s products must
compete for markets on their merits. And other
countries—notably Great Britain, France, the
Netherlands, and the United States—are also
seeking to expand their trade with Southeast Asia.
\Vhat then is the answer? Here is what the
Japanese tell us. After noting that there are
difﬁcult and stubborn internal problems they
themselves must solve, they say “The Japanese
nation . . . can exert very little control over the
elements which are shackling her foreign trade.
These problems—undeveloped or unavailable
nearby supply sources, unstable export markets,
inconvertibility of foreign currencies, tariff and
export-import quota limitations—are primarily in
the ﬁeld of international relations and their solu-
tion is dependent upon the development of good-
will and cooperation between the sovereign na-
tions of the free world . . . The United States
is the greatest economic power in the world today.
Actions taken by the U.S. Government, which
appear to the average American situated in his
powerful economy to be minor and unimportant,
may have a tremendous effect upon the economies
