I can assure you that President Eisenhower sees
as clearly as any living person that the welfare of
the United States is related to that of others.
When last year our President asked his brother to
visit the South American countries it was prima-
rily that this message might be brought to you in
a manner so authentic that no one could doubt it.
Dr. Milton Eisenhower’s re rt8 has been
brought to the attention of our overnment De-
part-ments with a request that they do all within
their power to carry out its recommendations.
Much has already been done in this respect and
more is in prospect. For example, the Commission
on Foreign Economic Policy, the Randall Com-
mission, has made speciﬁc recommendations"
which would give effect to that part of the report
which stressed the importance of stabilizing the
rules of international trade. Also, funds for tech-
nical assistance and cultural cooperation are be-
ing increased. The latter is particularly signiﬁ-
cant in view of Dr. Eisenhower’s recommendation
for “strengthening efforts to increase intercultural
understanding as the foundation of mutually
advantageous cooperation in all relevant areas.”
There are ﬁve speciﬁc matters which. I might
mention at this time.
COFFEE
1. First let me speak about coffee. I know that
it is not the desire of the coffee-producing coun-
tries of the Western Hemisphere that prices should
be so high as to discourage consumption and build
up habits of drinking other beverages. Present
prices are, I believe, primarily due to natural
causes beyond human control. Possibly to some
extent natural conditions are aggravated by arti-
ﬁcial trading on United States commodity ex-
changes.
But that is not a responsibility of the produc-
ers. We are lookin into that phase of the prob-
lem, and I am sure t at all will welcome any relief
that can be found in that quarter. The consumers
of the United States do not like it when prices go
up just as you do not like it when prices of your
exported commodities go down. \Ve accept it that
in a free system there are bound to be ﬂuctuations
in both directions. And I can assure ou that there
is no plan afoot to attempt to deal ar itrarily with
the problem of prices by imposing some artiﬁcial
price ceiling.
WOOL
2. Another matter which I know concerns you
is that of wool. The United States Tariff Com-
mission has recommended to the President an in-
crease in the tariﬁ‘ on wool. The President, how-
ever, has another plan which he has submitted to
Congress which Wlll, it is hoped, adequately sup-

port the wool industry of the United States with-
out imposing increased duties on imported wool.
The President told me last week that he had no
intention of acting favorably on the Tariff Com-
mission’s recommendation, pending congressional
consideration of his own proposal.‘
TECHNICAL COOPERATION
3. There has been some speculation with refer-
ence to the future of some of our overnmental
policies, principally with respect to t e Technical
Cooperation Prov'ram and the activity of the Ex-
port-Import Ba . We in the United States con-
sider that the Technical Cooperation Program is
an important way of bettering conditions of living
elsewhere. It spreads knowledge, and knowledge
is the great liberator. The Technical Cooperation
Program operates on a modest basis with more
dependence on quality than quantity. The qual-
ity of its work has, I believe, improved with
experience.
In Latin America the evidence is that this fact
is accepted by the governments concerned, which
have multiplied their own ﬁnancial support of
this program and taken over projects for further
independent development. In such ﬁelds as
public health and agriculture we can all feel a
real satisfaction in the knowledge that these co-
operative efforts have assisted in broadening and
strengthening the basis for economic development
by roviding more and better food for a more
hea thy population. The Government of the
United States ﬁrmly supports the continuance of
our bilateral technical assistance programs as well
as the programs carried on by the Organization of
American States.
Much important work in the ﬁeld of public
health and agriculture is done by private organi-
zations, as, for example, the Rockefeller Founda-
tion. It has made an immense contribution of
technical knowledge which has assisted Latin
American Governments in stamping out many
forms of disease. It is assisting in romoting
agricultural knowledge. The Unlted tates Gov-
ernment encourages these private efforts. But
also it intends at a governmental level to supple-
ment them.
CAPITAL FLOW
4. The United States was developed with the
help of private foreign capital, and 1t would like
to see its own ca ital now help to develop the eat
resources of other countries of this hemisp ere.
There exists in the United States ample capital
which is ready, willing, and able to perform its
develo ment function not only at home but also
abroad?
The spectacular development of Canada dur-
ing this century has been primarily due to cooper-
