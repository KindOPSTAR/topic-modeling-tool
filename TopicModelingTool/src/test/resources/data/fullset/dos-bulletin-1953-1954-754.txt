The North Atlantic Ocean Stations Agreement
by Ernest A. Lister
Relatively few people outside the ﬁelds of avia-
tion and meteorology are aware that a network of
ﬂoatin stations has been in existence in the North
Atlantic for more than 10 ears. Yet this net-
work has been considered su 'ciently important to
receive the continued support of virtuall all
nations whose airlines operate between orth
America and Europe. It constitutes a signiﬁcant
example of international cooperation in fpromoting
the safety, regularity, and eﬂiciency o trans-At-
lantic ﬂying.
An ocean station is a ﬁxed point at or near which
vessels are continuously osted on a rotation basis.
Such vessels are special y manned and equipped
to (provide weather observation, search and rescue,
an air navigation and communication services.
Meteorological information is reported regularly
to aircraft in ﬂight and to weather forecastin
services on both sides of the Atlantic. Unite
States partici ation is effected through the opera-
tion of U. S. Coast Guard vessels.
The United States and the United Kin dom had
maintained an extensive network in t e North
Atlantic during World War II for military rea-
sons. This system was virtually disbanded after
the war but the need for ocean stations became
pressing again with the advent of large-scale
airline operations between North America and
Europe. A requirement for the establishment and
operation of an ocean weather stations pro am
was ﬁrst ofﬁcially recognized at the PICAO ‘ orth
Atlantic Route Service Conference held in Dublin
in March 1946.
At the First Conference on North Atlantic
Ocean Stations (London, September 1946) an
agreement was drawn up for the 3-year period
July 1, 1947—June 30, 1950, with provision for its
modiﬁcation and renewal at a subse uent meeting
in 1949. This agreement provided (for the opera-
tion of a 13-station network with the United States
responsible for 7% stations. The Second Confer-
ence (London, April 20—May 12, 1949) drew up
‘ Provisional International Civil Aviation Organiza-
tion, predecessor to lose, the International Civil Aviation
Organization.
a new agreement establishing a lO-station network,
the United States accepting responsibility for 5%
stations, or 14 out of the 25 vessels re uired. This
agreement was to cover the 3 years rom July 1,
1950, to June 30, 1953, but it was extended by a
protocol, dated May 28, 1952, for a further period
of 1 year.
Under the terms of this protocol a Third Con-
ference was to be convened prior to October 1,
1953. The Third Conference (Bri hton, Eng-
land, July 8—15, 1953) was limited to ﬁnancial and
administrative matters only. The principal prob-
lem facing the Conference was the redistribution
of operating and cash responsibilities among the
states concerned. This was a natural consequence
of changes which had taken place since 1949 in the
relative number of North Atlantic crossings made
by airlines of the various countries. The pro rata
share of the United States had decreased from 14
to approximately 11 vessels if a 10-station program
were to be continued. It soon became clear at the
Third Conference, however, that European 0 er-
ating states were not ready to commit themse ves
to providing and maintaining three additional
vessels to re lace those no longer available from
the United tates.
Being limited to ﬁnancial and administrative
matters, the Third Conference was debarred from
examining the possibility of reducing the number
of stations. It recommended, therefore, that a
full conference be convened to review the whole
problem of North Atlantic Ocean Stations in
order to:
(a) Determine the number of stations and ves-
sels which would be technically ade uate for inter-
national civil air navigation in the orth Atlantic
region and practicable within the collective re-
sources available, and
(b Determine and agree upon responsibilities
for t e operation and ﬁnancing of the scheme.
