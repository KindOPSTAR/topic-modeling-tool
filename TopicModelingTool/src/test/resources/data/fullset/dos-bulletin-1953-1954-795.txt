smaller states in pursuit of their vital national
interests. Only in this hemisphere has a great
power formally forsworn intervention in favor of
the consultative process and the assumption of
joint responsibility with its smaller neighbors for
the maintenance of continental peace and security.
The success of this inter-American policy requires,
of course, that both principles are made to
function.
We may state it to be an axiom of inter-Ameri-
can relations that nonintervention can only be a
reality so long as an adequate collective system of
security is available to all States.
The problem of how to cope effectively with
aggression by subversion in the Americas is one
which has been foreseen since the Treaty of Rio
was adopted. We cannot foresee at this date the
exact steps through which a system of collective
security can best be applied to such a problem.
An important step was made at Caracas when the
Conference declared that the domination of the
political institutions of an American State by the
international Communist movement would con-
stitute grounds for invoking the consultative pro-
cedure under the Rio Treaty.2 The Organization
of American States may thus squarely confront
the problem. We may be conﬁdent that the re-
gional security system of the Americas will dem-
onstrate its vitality and effectiveness by acting
swiftly and decisively to protect this hemisphere
in any case of aggression by subversion should the
need arise.
Arms Shipment to Guatemala
From Soviet-Controlled Area
Press release 260 dated May 17
The Department of State is in receipt of reliable
information to the effect that an important ship-
ment of arms has been effected from Soviet-con-
trolled territory to Guatemala.
On May 15, the ship Alfhelm, believed to be
under charter, arrived at Puerto Barrios, Guate-
mala, carrying a large shipment of armament con-
signed to the Guatemalan Government. This
armament is now being unloaded at Puerto Bar-
rios. We are advised that the armament was
shipped from the Communist-administered port
of Stettin.
Because of the origin of these arms, the point of
their embarkation, their destination, and the quan-
tity of arms involved, the Department of State
considers that this is a development of gravity.

The President on May 13 received the allow-
ing messages from Rene O'oty, President 0 rance,
and Bao Dai, Chief of State of Viet- am, ae-
knowledgz'ng his com/Immicatiom of May 8.1
Message From Prosldont Coty
The tribute of the President of the United States
to the defenders of Dien-Bien-Phu goes straight
to the heart of the French people. Our profound
gratitude, Mr. President!
The soldiers and veterans of France and the
French Union will be proud that the Chief who
led the Armies of Liberty to victory salutes in this
magniﬁcent resistance the symbol of the inﬂexible
resolution of all men who, throughout the world
are and wish to remain free. It is a well-deserved
honor for the soldiers of de Castries.
France, who, as you note, Mr. President, has
always risen above her reverses, can now once
again surmount a trial so ainful and so glorious
with all her energy and alll her courage in close
solidarity with the peoples whose destiny is joined
with her destiny.
Our heroes’ sacriﬁce will make dearer and more
sacred to all the cause for which many have fallen
and all have fought beyond human strength.
Message From Boo Dal
I have receiVed with deep emotion the noble
message of May 8 in which you have wished to
express, in name people United States and in your
name, admiration for valiant soldiers of
Vietnamese forces who have defended heroically
Dien-Bien-Phu, with their French Union com-
rades, for two months.
The Vietnamese people and I are profoundly
touched by these expressions. \Ve express to you
our heartfelt gratitude and we ask you to convey
it to the great American people who have already
given us so many proofs of friendship.
The fall of Dien-Bien-Phu is in eﬂ'ect a painful
occurrence which affects us very much and affects
the peoples of the French Union and the free
world.
In spite of their heroism inscribed henceforth
in history, the defenders of the fortress were
swamped by the forces of those who, having sub-
jugated to their designs and fanaticized by their
untrue propaganda a certain number of my fellow-
countrymen, aspire to extend Communist d0-
minion over my country as over all the free
nations.
