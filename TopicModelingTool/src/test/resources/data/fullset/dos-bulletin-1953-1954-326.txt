Report on Berlin
Address by Secretary Dulles ‘
Last Friday evenin I returned to Washington
after 4 weeks of daily discussion at Berlin with the
Foreign Ministers of France, Great Britain, and
the Soviet Union—M. Bidault, Mr. Eden, Mr.
Molotov.’ Also, on the way back, I met with
Chancellor Adenauer of German .
I ﬁnd on my return that there is some confusion
as to what really happened. That is not surpris-
ing. It is dillicult to grasp quickly the results of
4 weeks of debate on many different matters. In-
deed, the full results cannot be clearly seen for
man months. I can, however, say that this meet-
ing ad two results which will profoundly in-
ﬂuence the future.
First, as far as Euro was concerned, we
brought Mr. Molotov to s ow Russia’s hand. It
was seen as a hand that held fast to everything it
had, including East Germany and East Austria,
and also it sought to grab some more.
Secondly, as far as Korea and Indochina were
concerned, we brought Mr. Molotov to accept a
resolution which sielled out the United States
position that Red hina might in these two in-
stances be dealt with, but not as a government
recognized by us.
You may ask whether it was worthwhile to go
to Berlin and to make the great eﬂ'ort that the Con-
ference involved merely to obtain these results.
My answer is “yes,” and I have no doubt about
that. Berlin cleared the way for other things to
happen. The uniﬁcation and the strengthening
of \Vest Europe may now go on. In Asia there
could be a uniﬁcation of Korea and an end to
aggression in Indochina, if Red China wants it.
I do not predict that these things will happen.
What I do say is that they could not have hap-
pened had it not been for Berlin.
Five years had ela sed since the Western Min-
isters had met with t is Soviet Foreign Minister.‘
During these 5 years much had occurred.
A war had started and been stopped in Korea.
A war had reached ominous proportions in
Indochina.
Stalin had died and his successors talked more
softly.
Six nations of Europe had created their Coal
and Steel Community and planned to move on to
a European Defense Community.
Communist China had emerged as an aggressive
military oroanization, allying its vast manpower
with that oirthe Soviet Union.
In the Soviet Union itself industrial and agri-
cultural strains were developing.
In East Germany the spontaneous outbreak of
June 17, 1953, revealed, in one enlightening ﬂash,
how much the ca tives crave freedom.
\Vhat did all 0 this add u to, in terms of world
oliticsi Many speculate and no one knew.
he uncertainty was leading to hesitation, wishful
thinking, and some paralysis of action.
There was only one way to ﬁnd out—that was
to meet with the Russians and deal with them in
terms of some ractical tests.
We went to erlin in the he that Soviet poli-
cies would now permit the uni cation of Germany
in freedom, or at least the liberation of Austria.
Those two matters would, in relation to Europe,
test the Soviet temper. \Ve ho d to achieve those
two results and we were determined to let no minor
obstacles deter us.
The obstacles we incurred were, however, not
minor but fundamental.
