The Hope
In the ways I outlined we ather strength for
the long-term defense of free om.
We do not, of course, claim to have found some
magic formula that insures against all forms of
Communist successes. It is normal that at some
times and at some places there ma be setbacks to
the cause of freedom. What we 0 expect to in-
sure is that any setbacks will have only temporary
and local signiﬁcance, because they will leave un-
impaired those free world assets which in the long
run will prevail.
If we can deter such aggression as would mean
general war, and that is our conﬁdent resolve, then
we can let time and fundamentals work for us.
We do not need self-imposed policies which sap
our strength.
The fundamental, on our side, is the richness—
spiritual, intellectual, and material—that freedom
can produce and the irresistible attraction it then
sets up. That is why we do not plan ourselves
to shackle freedom to preserve freedom. We in-
tend that our conduct and example shall continue,
as in the past, to show all men how good can be
the fruits of freedom.
If we rely on freedom, then it follows that we
must abstain from diplomatic moves which would
seem to endorse captivity. That would, in effect,
be a conspiracy against freedom. I can assure
you that we shall never seek illusory security for
ourselves by such a “deal.”
We do negotiate about speciﬁc matters but only
to advance the cause of human welfare.
President Eisenhower electriﬁed the world with
his proposal to lift a great weight of fear by turn-
ing atomic ener from a means of death into a
source of life.0 esterday, I started procedural
talks with the Soviet Government on that topic.
We have persisted, with our allies, in seekin
the uniﬁcation of Germany and the liberation 0
Austria. Now the Soviet rulers have agreed to
discuss these questions. We ex ect to meet them
soon in Berlin. I hope they wil come with a sin-
cerity which will equal our own.
We have sought a conference to unify Korea
and relieve it of forei n troops. So far, our per-
sistence is unrewarde ; but we have not given up.
These efforts at negotiation are normal initia-
tives that breathe the spirit of freedom. They
involve no plan for a partnership division of
world power with those who su press freedom.
If we persist in the courses outline we shall
confront dictatorship with a task that is, in the
long run, beyond its strength. For unless it
changes, it must suppress the human desires that
freedom satisfies—as we shall be demonstrating.
If the dictators persist in their present course,
then it is they who will be limited to superﬁcial
successes, while their foundation crumbles under
the tread of their iron boots.

Human beings, for the most part, want simple
things.
They want to worship God in accordance with
the dictates of their conscience. But that is not
easily granted by those who promote an atheistic
cree .
They want to think in accordance with the die-
tates of their reason. But that is not easily
granted by those who represent an authoritarian
system.
They want to exchange views with others and
to persuade and to be ersuaded by what appeals
to their reason and t eir conscience. But that
is not easily granted by those who believe in a
seciety of conformity.
They want to live in their homes without fear.
But that is not easily granted by those who believe
in a police state system. _ _
They want to be able to work productivel and
creatively and to enjoy the fruits of their abor.
But that is not easily granted by those who look
upon human beings as a means to create a power-
house to dominate the world.
\Ve can be sure that there is going on, even
within Russia, a silent test of strength between
the powerful rulers and the multitudes of human
beings. Each individual no doubt seems by him-
self to be helpless in this struggle. But their
aspirations in the aggregate make up a mighty
force.
There are signs that the rulers are bending to
some of the human desires of their peo le. There
are promises of more food, more house old goods,
more economic freedom.
That does not prove that the Soviet rulers have
themselves been converted. It is rather that they
may be dimly perceiving a basic fact, that is that
there are limits to the power of any rulers indeﬁ-
nitely to suppress the human spirit.
In that God-given fact lies our greatest hope.
It is a ho that can sustain us. For even if
the path aiizad be long and hard, it need not be
a warlike path; and we can know that at the end
may be found the blessedness of peace.
