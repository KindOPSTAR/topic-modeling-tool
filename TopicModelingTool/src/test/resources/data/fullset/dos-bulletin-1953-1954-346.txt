Even South and Central America, unitedas we
are on most issues, have received Communist at-
tention. Again the tactics are the same. They
play upon unrest. They ferment dissension. They
would create a cleavage between the Americas,
North and South. _ _ .
Asia, the Middle East, Africa, with their vast
resources of manpower and materials, are rich
prizes in the Soviet campaign. To divide and
separate the several states, to create antagonism
that would divide and separate them from the
United States, is a “must” on the Soviet program.
They must not succeed. But it will take states—
manshi of a high order to reconcile the diﬂ’erences
here. srael and the Arab States, India and Paki-
stan, Egypt and the United Kingdom, France and
Morocco—our role must be t _at of impartial
friendship. We dare not “take sides.” _
\Ve have made one point abundantly clear in our
new policies. There is no room in the “new look”
for further aggression in Korea. ‘If the Com-
munists renew their aggressive tactics there, the
response will not necessaril be conﬁned to Korea.
With that policy our frien s of the free world are
fully in accord. In a joint statement issued at the
time of the Korean armistice, the 16 U.N. members
with military forces in the Korean action said
very plainly that a breach of the armistice “would
be so grave that, in all probability, it would not
be possible to conﬁne hostihties within the fron-
tiers of Korea.” _
That same olicy) applies to Indochina. In a
recent speech ul es made this very deﬁnite
statement:
I have said in relation to Indochina that, it there were
open Red Chinese Army aggression there, that would
have grave consequences which might not be conﬁned to
Indochina.
The free world cannot afford another blood-
letting such as Korea.
This is not sabre-rattling. It is a very clear,
thoughtfully considered policy. We mean it.
And we want to make certain that the Commu-
nists know, well in advance, what our intentions
are if they elect to launch another aggression.
'I'Ie Wlth Domestle Pollclcs
This new US. foreign policy ties directly into
our domestic policies in that it is designed to
maintain and conserve our own strength.
We are rich. But our riches are not inexhaust-
ible.
Our past policies were expensive. They were
emergency measures, and in emergencies one does
not stop to count the cost. However, now that
our defenses are approaching a reasonable degree
of security and we are settling to the long pull,
it is another matter. We do not propose to per-
mit ourselves to be driven into practical bank-
ruptcy by the Communists.
The Soviets talk a lot about their planning for
“an entire historical era.” lrVe must prepare for
the same.
We do not propose, I hasten to assure you, to
weaken ourselves militarily just to save money.
We will not, in fact, be forced to take such a
dangerous step. In the past 6 ears we have
gathered tremendous strength. T ere is, for ex-
ample, NATO. Other treaties of mutual assistance
bind the free nations. Strategic airpower has
been given tremendous impetus. Thanks to the
strength and new emphasis u on our capacity to
retaliate, we can now depen upon a steady de-
gree of defense for our country and the free world.
We have the strength now and together with
the priority in our defense planning on a mobile
strategic reserve, we can, to quote Secretary
Dulles, “deter such aggression as would mean gen-
eral war. . . . We can let time and the funda-
mentals work for us. We do not need self-im-
posed policies which sap our strength.”
The US. proposed the concept of the lon haul
at the April meeting of the NATO Council. t won
general acceptance. Our allies, too, are deeply
aware of the need to conserve resources and
strength. No more than we, they do not want
to be forced into “practical bankru toy” and thus
give the Communists victory by de ault.
Our own domestic policies, of course, gear into
the “new look” given our foreign policies. We
are taking steps not only to conserve our strength
but to build it. Under the able and aggressive
leadership of our own Senator Wiley, working
for and with t e President, we have for example
launched the St. Lawrence Seaway project. As
a security measure, if nothing else, that project
will be of great worth.
The new collective security conoe t has reduced
nonproductive expenses of our allies to a point
where we are now able to cut down safely eco-
nomic foreign aid. Trade, broader markets, and
a new ﬂow of investments are the substitutes we
hope to offer. Such a rogram was recommended
in the recent report 0 the Randall Commission,
now being translated into legislation which the
President will submit to Congress.
We did not ropose cuttin oﬁ' economic aid
entirely. Broa 1y speaking, owever, hereafter
it will be limited to areas where it is clearly
needed for military strength.
Technical aid is being continued. We pro ose
to share our “know-how” with our friends 0 the
free world, helping them build strength through
economic improvement.
Our support of the United Nations remains con-
stant. The U.N. is, as President Eisenhower has
said, still man’s best organized hope to substitute
the conference table for the battleﬁeld. And at
that conference table the United States will
always be the ﬁrst to arrive and the last to leave
as long as one dim hope of peaceful settlement
remains.
