by military strength alone. The line can be held
only by the deployment of force, but the objec-
tive—peace—can be won onl by the quality of
inﬁnite patience. In our co laboration, we may
not always agree on every detail of the plans we
must discuss together, but there is no difference
between us on the fundamental aims which we
ursue; we may differ now and then on the “hows”
ut never on the “whys.” You may depend upon
us as faithful friends and comrades.
U.S. Economic Relations With Latin America
by Henry F. Holland
Assistant Secretary for I Mar-American Affairs 1
In no part of the country is there greater in-
terest in international trade or a more thorough
and constructive understanding of the factors
that sha e it than there is in the New Orleans
area. T is being true, you will undoubtedly be
interested in some analysis of the effect on our
economic relations with Latin America of the
Tenth Inter-American Conference recently con-
cluded in Caracas 2 and of the Conference of Min-
isters of Finance or Economy scheduled for Rio
de J aneiro next fall.
At Caracas the attitude of the delegates from
the other American Republics was precisely what
yours or mine would have been under the same
circumstances. They wanted to know the eco-
nomic olicy of this Administration as regards
Latin erica. They wanted to explain the cor-
respondin policies of their own governments.
Finally, t ey were eager to get down to a con-
structive discussion of what could be done about
speciﬁc problems within the framework of those
policies.
At that time, some rather important aspects of
our foreign economic policies were in the process
of being deﬁned. Dr. Milton Eisenhower’s re-
port and recommendations,8 drafted after his his-
toric trip through South America, were before
the public. The recommendations of the Randall
Commission‘ had been published and those of
Senator Capehart were made public during the
course of the Conference. Nevertheless, none of
these had been formally adopted by either the
Executive or the Congress.
On the other hand it was known that by next
fall the President’s message on foreign economic
olicy ° and his legislative pro am implementin
it would have been submit to Congress an
acted upon by it. We therefore made the deci-
sion, which I feel was constructive, that we would
meet again at a Conference of Ministers of Fi-
nance or Economy in Rio next fall. By that time
those important aspects of our own foreign policy
which are now undergoing reexamination should
have been passed u on by the Executive and the
Congress. This W1 1, I am conﬁdent give us a
basis for ﬁrm decisions on speciﬁc problems.
Wisely, it was decided that we would 0 ahead
with a full discussion of economic pro lems at
Caracas. The resulting discussions were beneﬁcial
to all of us. The United States now has before it
a complete statement of those problems which
most concern the other overnments. We know
in general how they woul like to go about solving
those problems. Where our own policy was clear
we, in turn, stated frankly the position of our
Government on each of these pomts. This ex-
change of views will be exceeding] helpful to all
of us in preparin for the Rio con erence.
There is much t at we can do by way of prepara-
tion. To the greatest extent practical, we must
arrive at a deﬁnition of our economic policy in
Latin America. As I have said, the President’s
message to Congress of March 30 and the action of
Congress on his legislative program will establish
guideposts for our policy.
That policy we know will not be static. In the
hands 0 an executive and legislative branch, each
seeking the same goal, it will be susceptible of
