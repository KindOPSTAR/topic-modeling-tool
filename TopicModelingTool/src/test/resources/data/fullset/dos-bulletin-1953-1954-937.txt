mediately reported to the Security Council.
Through various pacts, which are in accord with
the charter, we are involved in mutual-defense
arrangements with 38 other countries.
The Rio Treaty of 1947, better known as the
Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance,
is an arrangement which set a postwar example
in establishing-Ithe principle that the defense of
the American emisphere must be a collective re-
sponsibility and, consequently, that an armed at-
tack on one state would be considered an attack
against all. This treaty includes the 21 Ameri-
can Republics and, together with the Pact of B0-
ota of 1948, constitutes the basis for the collective
efense of the American Hemisphere.
The North Atlantic Treaty came into force in
1949 and now contains 14 members, including the
United States. Its basic principle is that an
armed attack against one or more of its members
in Europe or North America is considered an at-
tack against all, to be resisted collectively. As
you know, the members of NATO have made great
strides in organizing joint forces and facilities as
part of an integrate collective security system, in
which each member contributed according to its
means and ca abilities.
In the Paci c, the United States has developed
a series of security treaties, approved b the
Senate on March 20, 1952, between the nited
States and Japan, the United States and the
Philippines, and the United States, New Zealand,
and Australia. These pacts recognize that an
armed attack in the Paciﬁc area on any of the
signatories would be dangerous to the eace and
security of the others and obligates al to meet
common dangers in accordance with their consti-
tutional processes. In addition to these pacts,
the United States has entered into a security
treaty with Japan under which we maintain armed
forces in and about Japan to deter armed attack,
while Japan is increasmgly to assume responsi-
bility for its own defense. A similar securit pact
has also been si ed between Korea and the nited
States, provi mg for mutual defense against
armed attack.
The meaning of United States participation in
collective security arrangements can be summed
up quite briefly. Our concept is that military
establishments should be created on a community
basis, where armed forces will not be used at the
discretion of a single state or a single person, but
only under circumstances which unite several
states against aggression. This collective security
approach is not, by its very nature, susceptible to
being used for aggressive purposes. It rests upon
the necessity for the free nations to pool their re-
\s0urces for the most effective defense.
Eﬂorts Toward Disarmament
Patient and persistent effort toward general
disarmament constitutes the fourth of the general

approaches employed by the United States in its
attempts to attain this goal of peace with free-
dom and security. As a practlcal matter, the
United States efforts to attain collective security
and to achieve disarmament are opposite faces of
the same coin. Their purpose is to achieve a
reliable common protection against attack in order
to relieve nations from the fear of aggression.
One element of this purpose is collective security,
and the other element is “disarmament.” By dis-
armament we mean the regulation and balanced
reduction of all armed forces and all nonatomic
armaments, the prohibition of nuclear weapons
as the result of effective international controls,
and the provision of adequate safeguards to make
sure that all nations comply with such a program.
In contrast to our far-ranging and serious
efforts, the Soviet Union has concentrated on a few
ideas, simple to the eye and ear, designed largely
for propaganda purposes—but which would also
have worked to the advantage of the USSR.
and the peril of the free world. The Soviets
proposed a variety of devices which would have
obligated the free world not to manufacture or
use atomic weapons, without bein sure the
USSR. would do likewise because here would
be no means of piercing the Iron Curtain.
In 1945, the United States had a monopoly of
atomic weapons. Nevertheless, we tried to ﬁnd
ways to eliminate the threat of atomic warfare
under ade uate safeguards to rotect all states.
It was on t e initiative of the nited States that
agreement was reached in Moscow in December
1945 with the United Kingdom and the Soviet
Union on a pro osal for establishing a U.N.
Atomic Energy Commission. In this Commis-
sion, from its establishment on J anuar ' 24, 1946,
through 1948, the United States trie to reach
agreements with the Soviet Union which would
e 1minate nuclear weapons as a result of effective
international control to insure atomic energy was
used for peaceful purposes only.
The discussions of the U.N. Atomic Ener
Commission culminated in the approval of t e
U.N. plan for the international control of atomic
energy, by the overwhelming majority of the Gen-
eral Assembly in 1948. This plan was largely
based on the United States proposal {pften called
the Baruch plan) as modiﬁed in the .N. Atomic
Energy Commission. It would provide for the
elimination and prohibition, through effective in-
ternational control procedures, of all the various
types of weapons based on_ the release of atomic
energy. Failure to put thls plan into effect was
due to the Soviet Union’s adamant refusal either
to accept the lan or to propose any reasonable al-
ternative. T e Soviet proposals, as practicall
all members of the U.N. recognize, present the i -
lusion and not the reality of security. They
would have permitted some kind of periodic in-
spection and would have allowed special inspection
only under circumstances in which the suspected
