Official Termination of
International Materials Conference
The Central Group of the International Ma-
terials Conference met, as previously scheduled,
on December 15, 1953, to review the raw materials
situation and determine the future of the
Conference.
The Central Group noted that, since the dis-
solution of the last Commodity Committee on
September 30, 1953, there has been no new develop-
ment which would call for action b the Conference
in accordance with its terms of re erence.
The Central Group, in noting, therefore, that
the Inc had accomplished its tasks, recognized
that the methods used in coping with the short-
ages had been eﬂ'ective and could serve as a guide in
any future emergency shortage. It consequently
recommended that the Conference be ofﬁcially
terminated as of December 31, 1953.
In making this recommendation, the Central
Group noted that representatives of all its mem-
bers have indicated their readiness to consult
among themselves, at the initiative of any one of
them, in the event of concern over threatened
shortages.
The International Materials Conference was
convened in February 1951 at the invitation of the
three sponsoring Governments (France, the United
Kingdom, and the United States) to deal with
the raw materials shortage which developed in the
free world following the outbreak of hostilities in
Korea.
During the period of its activities, the Confer-
ence was concerned with the following raw ma-
terials: copper, zinc, lead, manganese, nickel,
cobalt, sulfur, tungsten, wool, newsprint, wood
pulp, cotton, and cotton linters.
