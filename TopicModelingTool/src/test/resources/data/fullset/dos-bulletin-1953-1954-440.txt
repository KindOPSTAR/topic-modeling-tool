means to achieve effective defense at minimum
cost.
The Current Mllltery Program
One of the basic tasks of the new administra-
tion has been to review our military program in
the light of the foregoing policies.
In the years 1945—53, our military programs
went through wide ﬂuctuations which hindered
orderly and eﬂicient administration. During the
ﬁrst part of this eriod, the olicy was to reduce
the military esta lishment astically. During
the latter art of the period, the policy was to
increase t e military establishment rapidly.
During both the decrease and the increase the
military budget reﬂected the so-called “balance of
forces” concept. In practical terms, this meant
splitting the available funds into three roughly
equal shoes for the Army, Navy, and Air Force.
When the Eisenhower administration took ofﬁce,
our national security programs, at home and
abroad, were costing over $50 billion a year, and
were planned at about $55 billion for the next ear.
Budgetary deﬁcits were of the order of $10 billion,
despite taxes comparable to wartime taxes. In-
ﬂation was de reclating the purchasing power of
the dollar. ur allies were similarly burdened.
The American peo 1e have repeatedly shown
that the are prepare to make whatever sacriﬁces
are real y necessary to insure our national safety.
They would no doubt support military expenses
at t e levels which their government told them
were r uired for security, even at the cost of
budget eﬁcits, resultant inﬂationary pressures,
and tax levels which would impair incentives.
But the patriotic will to sacriﬁce is not something
to be drawn upon needlessly. Government has
the high duty to seek resourcefully and inven-
tively the ways which will rovide security with-
out sacriﬁcing economic and) social welfare. The
security policies we here describe make possible
more selective and more eﬂicient programs in
terms of the composition of forces and of pro-
curement.
The new administration has sought to read-
just, in an orderly way, the program for the mili-
tary forces. Before this could be done, it was
necessary to clarify the extent of our reliance on
collective security; to deﬁne more clearly our
basic strategy both in Europe and the Far East;
to reassert our freedom of action in repelling
future aggression; to assess the impact of newer
types of weapons; and to relate the composition
and size of our ready and potential forces to all
these factors.
Inevitany this has taken time. It has required
a series of difficult basic decisions by the Pres-
ident with the advice of the National Security
Council and with supporting decisions by the De-
partment of State, the Department of Defense,
and the Treasury Department. It has been neces-
sary to exchange views with congressional leaders
and our principal allies and to inform world
opinion so that neither our friends nor our enemies
a road would misinterpret what we were doing.
By now, however, the new course is charted and 18
guiding our military planning. As a result, it is
now possible to get, and share, more basic securit
at less cost. That is reﬂected in the budget whic
the President has submitted for the 1955 ﬁscal
year. In this budget, national security expendi-
tures for ﬁscal year 1955 will amount to $45 bil-
lion as compared with $50 billion for 1953 and
$49 billion for 1954.
Initially this reshaping of the military program
was misconstrued in various respects. Some su -
gestcd that the United States intended to re y
wholly on large-scale strategic bombing as the
sole means to deter and counter aggression. What
has already been said should dispose of this
erroneous idea. The potential of massive attack
will always be kept in a state of instant readiness,
and our program will retain a wide variety in the
means and scope for responding to aggression.
Others interpreted the program as a move away
from collective security. The exact opposite is
the case, as has been shown. Our policies are
based squarely on a collective security system and
depend for their success on its continuing vitality.
Still others feared that we intended to withdraw
our forces from abroad in the interest of mobility.
Now that the ﬁghtin is ended in Korea, our forces
in the Far East will] be reduced in numbers, as
has previously been announced, but the kind of
force that remains will have great striking power.
Moreover, the pro am does not mean that we
intend to pull our orces out of Europe. It is, of
course, essential that the continental nations
themselves provide a harmonious nucleus of inte-
grated defense. If they do so, the United States
would ex ect to maintam substantial forces of its
own in urope, both in su port of the forward
strategy of defense and fhr political reasons.
Another consequence of our new policies is that
it has become practicable to reduce our economic
aid to our allies. The technical assistance pro-
gram will go on and economic aid is not wholly
excluded. There are still some places near the
Soviet orbit where the national governments can-
not maintain adequate armed forces without hel
from us. That is notably so in the Middle and
Far East. We have contributed largely un-
grudgingly, and I hope constructivel , to end
a gression and advance freedom in ndochina.
'1ng stakes there are so high that it would be cul-
pable not to contribute to the forces struggling
to resist Communist oppression.
But broadly speaking, economic aid in the form
of grants is on its way out as a major element of
our foreign policy. This is highly desirable from
many standpoints. It helps to make our own
budget more manageable and it promotes more
