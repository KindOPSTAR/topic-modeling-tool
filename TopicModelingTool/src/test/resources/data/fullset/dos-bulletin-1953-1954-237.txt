of the last of the acceptances required for
effectiveness.
The Council would then determine whether the
amendment was of such a nature that nonaccepting
consuming countries should be suspended from
the agreement when the amendment became effec-
tive. In the event of such a determination, a
consuming country would automatically be sus-
pended if it informed the Council that the amend-
ment was still unacceptable. However, if the con-
suming country satisﬁed the Council that its ac-
ceptance could not be secured by the effective date
of the amendment because of constitutional diﬂi-
culties, the Council could postpone suspension
until such difﬁculties were overcome and the coun-
try notiﬁed the Council of its decision. A country
w ich had been suspended could be reinstated by
the Council on equitable terms and conditions.
A consuming country which considered that its
interests would be adversely affected by an amend-
ment could withdraw from the agreement on the
date the amendment took effect or suspension was
determined.
The article on amendments and suspension could
itself be amended, however, only if the amendment
were accepted by or on behalf of all participating
countries.
Any participating government could withdraw
from the agreement provided at least 12 months’
notice was given not earlier than 2 years after the
agreement came into force. In the absence of such
notice, or except in the particular circumstances
for which special provisions are made in the ar-
ticles concernin national security or amendments,
a government wihich withdrew from the agreement
during its currenc would not be entitled to any
share of the procee s from liquidation of the buffer
stock or any share of the other assets of the Council
on the termination of the agreement. However, a
consuming country which was suspended in con-
nection with nonacceptance of an amendment
would not lose any entitlement to share in the as-
sets of the Council on the termination of the
agreement.
Obllgatlons of Partlclpatlng Governments
Participating governments would obligate them-
selves to cooperate in promoting the attainment of
the objectives of the agreement and, in particular,
these governments:
(a) would not, so long as sufﬁcient uantities
of tin were available to meet their ful require-
ments, prohibit or limit the use of tin for speciﬁed
purposes except in circumstances in which such
pro ibition or limitation would be ermitted by
the General Agreement on Tariffs and) Trade or by
the articles of agreement of the International
Monetary Fund;
(b) would create conditions promoting the
transfer of tin production from less efﬁcient to
more efﬁcient enterprises and would encourage
conservation of natural resources of tin by prevent-
ing the premature abandonment of deposits;
(c) would not dispose of noncommercial stocks
of tin except upon 6 months’ public notice, statin
reasons for disposal the quantity to be release ,
the lan of dis osai, and the date of the avail-
ability of the tin. Such disposal should protect
producers and consumers against avoidable dis-
ruption of their usual markets. A participating
government wishin to dispose of such stocks
would consult, at t 1e request of the Council or
of any other articipating government, as to the
best means ofavoidlng substantial injury to the
economic interests of producing and consuming
countries and would give due consideration to any
recommendations of the Council;
(d) would seek to insure fair labor standards
in the tin industry in order to avoid the depression
of living standards and the introduction of un-
fair competitive conditions in world trade.
The agreement provides that nothing in it shall
be construed to:
(a) require a government to furnish informa-
tion the disclosure of which it might consider con-
trary to its essential smurity interests;
(b) prevent a government from taking any ac-
tion it might consider necessary to protect its
essential security interests where such action was
taken in time of war or other emergency or re-
lated to traﬁic in implements of war or other
trafﬁc supp] ing a military establishment;
(c) inter ere with any intergovernmental
agreement made b or for a military establishment
for the purpose 0 meetin essential requirements
of national security, or ot er agreement on behalf
of a government for this purpose; or
(d) prevent a government from taking any ac-
tion in pursuance of its obligations under the
Charter of the United Nations.
Complalnts
Any participating country could complain to
the Council if it considered its economic interests
under the agreement seriously injured by the
action of another participating government, unless
such action were taken in time of war under the
national-security exceptions just mentioned. The
Council would review the facts and decide b con-
current majorities, counted separately, w ether
the complaint was justiﬁed. The complaining
overnment could withdraw from the agreement
if the Council found justiﬁcation for the com-
plaint.
Complaints that any participating countr had
committed a breach of the agreement cou d be
referred to the Council for decision, as could dis-
putes concerning the agreement. A majority of
the articipating countries, or countries holding
not ess than one-third of the votes, could require
the Council, after full discussion, to seek the opin-
