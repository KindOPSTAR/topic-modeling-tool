ration will be carried out under the direction of
the Secretary of the Treasury after the succession
of the Corporation expires on June 30, 1954. The
reorganization plan modiﬁes that arrangement b
placing responsibility for the completion of eac
of the activities described above under the juris-
diction of an agency responsible for a similar con-
tinuing program. Thus, the reor anization plan
facilitates the orderly and expe itious liquida-
tion of the affairs of the Corporation.
It is not, however, practicable at this time to
specif the reductions of expenditures which it is
proba le will be brought about b the taking effect
of the reorganizations containe in the plan.
After investigation, I have found and hereby
declare that each reorganization included in Re-
organization Plan No. 2 of 1954 is necessary to
accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth
in section 2 (a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949,
as amended.
I urge that the Con ess allow the reorganiza-
tion plan to become e ective.
