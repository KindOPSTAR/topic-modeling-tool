2. Re arding trade in strategic materials, rec-
ommen ed that consideration be given to the effect
of decisions relating to these materials on the
economies of the American States and that pro-
cedures be introduced ermitting the exchange of
views in order to stugy any practical measures
relative to the adverse effects of such decisions;
3. Regarding public ﬁnancing of economic de-
velopment, recommended that the governments
suggest to existing ublic-ﬁnanced institutions
that they give specia consideration to measures
to increase effectively their orierations in the ﬁeld
of economic develo ment in atin America;
4. Regarding teclinical cooperation, decided to
consider the OAS Program “as an actiwty of a con-
tinuing nature” and to urge the participating
governments to maintain and poss1bly increase
their resent level of contributions;
5. garding economic resources of the con-
tinental shelf, requested the Council of the Oas
to convoke a special conference in 1955 to consider
as a whole the different juridical and economic
aspects of this question; and
6. Regarding the Inter-American Economic and
Social Council, made a series of suggestions with
respect to its internal operations aimed at mak-
ing it a more effective instrument for dealing with
economic and social problems of the American
States.
In the economic ﬁeld the United States voted
against the resolutions on Reductions of Restric-
tions on Inter-American Trade, and Terms of
Trade and Prices; abstained on those dealing with
Agricultural Surpluses, Agrarian Reform, and
Economic Development, an Taxes on Passenger
Fares in the Caribbean and Central America.
The United States objection to the resolution on
inter-American trade was based on the one-sided
nature of the recommendation. On the terms of
trade and prices resolution the United States ob-
j ection was directed at the section referring to “an
equitable level of remunerative prices to permit
a balance in terms of trade,” which seemed to
imply a commitment which the United States
could not accept. U.S. abstention on the last
three of the resolutions listed above was explained
as follows:
1. In the case of agricultural surpluses, the
variable nature of the problem made it necessary
for the United States not to commit itself deﬁn-
itively on a matter currently under intensive study
in the executive and legislative branches of our
government;
2. On agrarian reform, the resolution, in focus-
ing solely on redistribution of land, followed too
narrow an approach to this broad and important
subject; and
3. On the question of taxes on passenger fares,
that this is a matter which, for the United States,
the Congress must decide.
Soclal Matters
The Conference considered six broad topics in
the social ﬁeld, covering social aspects of eco-
nomic development, human rights, housing, coop-
eratives, rural exodus, and social welfare.
Twenty-two resolutions relating to various aspects
of these topics were adopted.
The discussions revealed general awareness of
the social problems accompanying economic de-
velopment and of the need for governments and
international agencies to 've pro er attention to
measures in the ﬁelds of ealth, ousing, educa-
tion, and social welfare in planning and executing
economic development programs. Resolutions
adopted on this subject, as well as on the related
topics of rural migration and social welfare work,
re ect a reco ition of this need and urge the gov-
ernments an the appropriate organs of the OAS
through training courses, seminars, specialized
conferences, and technical studies to give increased
attention to the development of base social serv-
ices in rural areas and the training of personnel
for planning and administering sound programs.
In t e ﬁeld of labor, an important aspect of eco-
nomic development, the resolutions adopted de—
clare the intention of governments to continue to
encourage the development of free and nuinely
democratic labor unions; to recommen periodic
information courses for workers to rovide them
with a knowledge of their rights an duties; and
to urge closer coordination between the Or ani-
zation of American States and the International
Labor Organization.
The widespread interest in the Americas in hous-
ing and in cooperatives as a means for raising eco-
nomic and social standards was manifest in the
various proposals adopted for encouraging further
development in these ﬁelds. Measures recom-
mended for improving housing include the conven-
ing of meetings of housing experts to advise IA—
Ecosoc on activities to be carried out; the appoint-
ment of a committee of three experts to work with
IA—Eoosoo on a continuing bas1s; and the estab-
lishment of the present Inter-American Housing
Center on a permanent basis. Studies were re-
quested on the use of standardized construction
materials and the effects which the establishment
of a private inter-American bank for housing
would have on the problem of low-cost housing.
\Vith respect to cooperatives, the Conference re-
quested the Pan American Union to make studies
covering cooperative legislation and experience
gained in the coo erative ﬁeld and to provide,
within its ﬁnancia resources, technical assistance
to the governments through training of leaders in
the cooperative movement, regional seminars, and
expansion of its secretariat services in connection
with rural credit, consumer, low~cost housing, and
multiservice cooperatives.
In addition to the Declaration of Caracas and
the racial discrimination resolution referred to
above, the Conference adopted certain resolutions
