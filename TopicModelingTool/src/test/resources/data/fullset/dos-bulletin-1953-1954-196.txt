The Salt of Freedom
by Theodore C. Streibert
Director, U.S. Information Agency ‘
I am particularly glad to 'oin with you in honor-
ing the 10 young men you ave selected for their
outstanding achievements. And I am glad for
this occasion because I want to talk about a seri-
ous problem which concerns these young men—in
fact, concerns all Americans.
Today the forces of communism are on the loose.
The threat, the tensions, the deceit practiced by
the Kremlin affect your well-being and your per-
sonal lives here more than anything occurring in
the United States.
Even now as I s eak, an event is about to take
place which ars irectly on your lives. In Ber-
iii tonight leaders of the free world and the slave
world are preparing to meet in an effort to ease
world tensmns.
Certainly this is the major problem of our time.
The 10 young leaders we honor tonight are living
symbols of America. Not so many years ago, they
and you were born on a blessed $01], the fertile $011
of freedom.
I ask you, for a few moments, to think of that
soil and what it means to you—how rich it is with
rights and privileges and responsibilities for the
individual too often taken for granted.
Suppose you had been born in the Soviet Union.
Picture. for a moment. what would have been your
fate. Suppose you 10 young men had own up
on the soil of slave instead of the soil 0 freedom.
First, in the Sowet Union you are born without
any chance of freedom. You are to be only a
pawn of the SOViet state.
Let’s take a close look at what would have been
vour lot under the Communist system which the
remlin is striving to impose on more and more
peoples.
You are city-born and your parents are not of
the privileged class. Each member of your family
has about 6 feet by 6 feet of dwelling space. Three
or four families share the apartment with your
family.

the Junior Chamber of Commerce, Seattle. Wash, on
Jan. 23 (released to the press by UBIA on Jan. 21).
More than half of all mothers in the Soviet
Union must work. So your mother will un-
doubtedly go back to her bench or her office job
shortly after you are born.
You are then placed in a state nursery. Your
mother sees you only when given time from her
job to nurse you and to pick you up at night.
Your indoctrination to communism begins at
the tender age of three, when you enter a nursery
school. While your mother works you stay there,
until you are seven. Then you enter ublic school.
Beginning with kinder ii'ten, you Ion to the
Young Pioneers, the “cu ” outﬁt of the (,oniniu-
nist Party. About 13 million children belong to
this organization. Here you learn the funda-
mentals of marchin , military organization, and
disciplinkalways, ngCl line.
As a city boy, you wil have a chance to attend
a 7-year grade school. It is supposed to be uni-
versal throughout the country. But in rural
Russia you get only 4 years’ elementary schooling
at most.
“Free” Secondary idueatlen
Education in the secondary school is also sup-
posed to be “free.” Yet you will not go to a
secondary school unless your parents pay your
tuition and buy your uniform, textbooks, paper,
and other school equipment.
If vour parents cannot afford to send you to
secondary school, you enter instead into what is
known as an on, which is theoretically a trade
or technical school.
Actually the F20 is on-the-job training. The
aim here is to channel humans directly into the
industrial machine of the USSR
There you get your ﬁrst lesson in wages. While
working in a factory to learn your trade. at very
low wages, you give the state one-third of your
total pay for your “free schoolin .” The factory
takes another third. You keep for yourself only
one of three rubles earned.
If you are fortunate enough to be among the
small number going to a col ege, you know that
