turn to consideration of the speciﬁc proposals be-
fore us. At this moment we are still con-
fronted with three important issues which have
been debated at length at a number of meetings
and without result. The ﬁrst of these is, as I and
others of my collea es said yesterday afternoon,
the s ecial nature 0 the problem existing in Laos
and ambodia.
I believe that both Mr. Eden and Mr. Bidault
unanswerably demonstrated the necessity of sepa-
rate treatment for those two countries where peace
would automatically be restored by the withdrawal
of the invading Viet Minh force.
The second issue is that of the powers of the
international supervisory commisslon for Viet,
Nam. This commission must, obviously, have the
authority and facilities to settle any roblems or
differences which cannot be adjusted by the joint
commissions of the belligerents, and logically,
therefore, its decisions must be binding on those
joint commissions.
The third vital issue is the composition of the
international su ervisory commission. As I and
others of us sai before, a commission containing
states unable to meet the test of impartiality—that
is, a commission the counterpart of that set up in
Korea, on which Communist state members have
been able by veto to prevent effective supervision—
is obviously an unsatisfactory and an unacceptable
proposal. Yesterday the representative of the
United Kingdom proposed the Colombo powers.
I welcomed that proposal. This afternoon the
representative of Viet-Nam proposed the U.N.
That would be acceptable.
Both are reasonable proposals. The proposal
of the Soviet Union, from my point of view, and
I think from that of the majority of my colleagues,
is not reasonable.
I am obliged to state that the Soviet, the
Chinese Communist, and the Viet Minh delega-
tions have, so far, shown no signs of willingness
to resolve these issues on any reasonable basis
which could be acceptable to this conference, or
which would inspire and insure the return of peace
to Indochina. I hope that I am wrong, but the
negative results of our last meeting seem to sup-
port this conclusion.
EXCERPTS FROM MAY 4 MEMORANDUM TO
KOREAN MILITARY ARMISTIOE COMMISSION
The Department of Defense on May 29 released
two documents relating to the Neutral Nations
Supervisory Commission (NNSC) in Korea:
(1) a memorandum dated April 30 from the Polish
and Czechoslovak members of the NIVSC to the
Military Armistice Commission, and (2) a memo-
randum commenting on the Polish and Czecho-
slo'valc commwnioatiOn, sent to the Military Armi-
stice Commission on May I, by the Swedish and
Swiss members of the NIVSC.2 Printed below are
excerpts from the latter document.
On 29 April the Polish Member of the Neutral
Nations Supervisory Commission submitted for
the consideration of the Commission, at its 124th
meeting, a draft to a report to be directed to the
Military Armistice Commission. The Swedish
and the Swiss Members of the Neutral Nations
Supervisory Commission rejected this draft in its
entirety. The Czechoslovak and Polish Members
thereupon decided to forward the document to the
Military Armistice Commission in their own name.
The Czechoslovak and Polish Members are, of
course, perfectly free to convey to the Military
Armistice Commission whatever views and opin-
ions they hold. As this particular document claims
to be based, however, on facts and ﬁgures collected
by the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams, the
Swedish and Swiss Members feel called upon to
present a few comments to the report submitted by
the Czechoslovak and Polish Members to the Mili-
taiiy Armistice Commission.
11 the introductory part of their report the
Czechoslovak and Polish Members charge the
United Nations Command side with (a) obstruct-
ing and restricting the activities of the Neutral
Nations Inspection Teams (b) introducing mili-
tary reinforcements into Korea, (c) violating the
provisions of the Armistice Agreement under
which replacements of combat materiel shall be
made piece-for-piece of the same effectiveness and
the same types.
The contention that the United Nations Com-
mand side has obstructed and restricted the ac-
tivities of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams
is utterly ridiculous. The United Nations Com-
mand has from the outset wholeheartedly and un-
reservedly cooperated with the Neutral Nations
Supervisory Commission and its Inspection
Teams. Errors and mistakes have admittedly oc-
curred and there have also been cases of omission,
but never has any intention of circumventing
the provisions of the Armistice Agreement been
prwed. The Neutral Nations Inspection Teams
have been in the unique position of being able to
check on the movements of goods amounting to
many millions of tons in the sea-ports of Pusan,
Inchon and Kunsan, and on the movements of
aircraft amounting to many thousands of planes.
With such a considerable turnover, it is obvious
that some allowance must be made for discrepan-
cies and inaccuracies.
There is no evidence whatsoever to show that
the United Nations Command side has increaSed
’ The Department of Defense release also included two
documents previously made public at Panmunjom by the
United Nations Command: A letter from Maj. Gen. J. K.
Lacey of the Um: dated April 15 (for text, see BULLETIN
of May 3, 1954, p. 689) and a memorandum of May 4
from the Swedish and Swiss members of the ano to the
senior member of the Military Armistice Commission.
