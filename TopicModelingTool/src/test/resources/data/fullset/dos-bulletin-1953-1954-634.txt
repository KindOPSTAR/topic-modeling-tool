whom they have lived that in international affairs
Americans wish to be sincere partners with, as the
President has said, “anyone who holds out the
hand of friendshi to us as we do to them.”
These appraisa s have been ampliﬁed and con-
ﬁrmed by such recent studies as those undertaken
by the Senate Subcommittee on the Operation of
Overseas Information Programs (the Hicken-
looper Committee), including the reaction of
American Ambassadors, forei correspondents,
and others. They indicate 0 early that careful
planning, detailed preparation and counseling,
and purposeful activity can do much to enhance
the impact of our travelers on the people of other
countries, and vice versa. In this connection at-
tention should be called to the growing body of
valuable literature, produced by various special-
ists and organizations, which represents thought-
ful study and evaluation of various exchange and
travel projects.
Some Generalizations and Suggestions
What is now being done to make the travel of
Americans more signiﬁcant is encouraging. It
also points the way to what can be done by other
agencies or organizations as they become interested
in this question.
In the ﬁrst place, further encouragement should
be given to trips to areas of the world which few
Americans viSit, to travel for longer periods of
time, and to more extended stays in particular
countries and localities. Much can be accom-
plished through special travel arrangements at re-
uced rates and the ﬁnancin of projects by
individuals, service clubs, and 0t er organizations.
Recent trips to the Middle East by student groups
oﬁ'er stimulating and instructive examples.
At the same time, every eﬁ'ort should be made to
develop greater and more widespread awareness of
the responsibilities of American travelers. Much
of our irresponsibility as travelers has stemmed
from our tourists’ “emancipation” from the sanc-
tions that restrain their conduct at home. An
awareness of the role of America in what President
Eisenhower has described as “not a moment but
an age of crisis” should restrain their conduct
abroad.
In pursuit of such an awareness, prospective
travelers should realize the value of a knowledge
of a country, its language, and its people. They
should have some idea of its relations with the
United States. They should cultivate respect for
the people of host countries, an awareness of their
special problems, a desire to share common inter-
ests and to undeistand si niﬁcant differences. In
their conduct, they shouh? strive truly to represent
our eople—and at our best.
T e businessman will ﬁnd that such an approach
is good business. The educator and student should
ﬁnd it indispensable. The tourist should ﬁnd that,
far from detracting from his tri , it enriches it.
In fact, such attitudes can best e built around
their major interests—be they business, education,
or tourism.
For man , a trip abroad is a unique experience;
they shoul be receptive to reasonable p ans and
suggestions. As Fred M. Hechinger, education
editor of the New York Herald Tribune, has
pointed out :
It has been my experience that the way to have the
best possible time on a foreign trip is to have some sort
of real objective. . . . The point is that such interests
will give you a frame of reference which the ordinary
tourist lacks. It does not limit and certainly does not
exclude all other activities of the traveler. On the con-
trary, it may intensify them. It certainly will make their
pursuit more intelligent. It will, above all, enable you
to deal with people on a more meaningful level.
An increase in organized, sponsored travel
should be encouraged insofar as the projects are
worthwhile and send abroad people whose trips
will make a desirable impact in other countries
and at home.
Responsible sponsors and leaders of organized
travel projects should be alert to proﬁt from the
growing body of experience of numerous organi-
zations already in this ﬁeld. S iﬁcally, the
should keep in mind the value 0 rojects whic
make effective contact with peop e in the host
countries, which are useful or gratifying to them,
or which underscore common interests and goals.
They should work closely and intelligently with
afﬁliated or counter art organizations in host
countries and enlist t eir full cooperation. They
should plan projects carefully and realistically.
They should screen prospective participants care-
fully and prepare and assist them in every way to
assure the success of the project. Where they
select or ﬁnance participants, they should give due
consideration to types of people who can contribute
not only to the speciﬁc purposes of the articular
project but also to the roader goals 0 coopera-
tion and understanding.
One attempt to do so is that of the U. S. Na»
tional Commission for UNFsco, which at a regional
conference last September at the UniverSity of
Minnesota included “The American as Tourist and
Host” as one of its rincipal topics. The Com-
mission is pursuing tliis matter further and hopes
to include the same topic in the series of Citizen
Consultation Conferences which it will sponsor
in various arts of the country during the current
year. Suc 1 conferences could stimulate broader
interest in this roblem and prompt other civic
organizations to discuss it.
These are sizeable objectives. To attain them,
all classes and types of travelers should be reached.
The most effective channels are those near at
hand—the mass media, authorized publishers,
travel agencies, transportation companies, and au-
tomobile clubs, the organizers of various types of
group travel, and the sponsors of interchange pro-
grams. New channels should be developed and
additional organizations and agencies should be
persuaded to participate. The stimulation of
