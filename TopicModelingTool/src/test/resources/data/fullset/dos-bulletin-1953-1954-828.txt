time of aggression, we now see the ﬁnal vindica-
tion of that princi le in our 'oint action in Korea,
I can only be than ful that 0d gave me strength
to persist in our faith until the moment of its re-
cent glorious vindication.
We do not view this principle as an extenuation
for failing to defend one’s homeland to the last
dro of one’s blood, and, indeed, our own struggles
during the last two decades bear testimony to our
conviction that in matters of collective security
as of Providence, “God helps him who helps him-
self.” However, we feel that nowhere can the
call for aid against aggression be refused by any
state, large or small. It is either a universal prin-
cigile or it is no principle at all. It cannot admit
0 regional application or be of regional respon-
sibility. That is why we, like you, have sent
troops halfway around the world to Korea. We
must face that responsibility for its application
wherever it may arise in these troubled hours of
world history. Faithful to her traditions and out-
look and to the sacred memory of her patriots who
fell in Ethiopia and in Korea in defense of that
principle, Ethiopia cannot do otherwise.
The world has ceaselessly sought for and
striven to apply some system for assuring the
peace of the world. Many solutions have been
proposed and many have failed. Today the sys-
tem which we have advocated and with which the
name of Ethiopia is inseparany associated has,
after her sacriﬁces of two decades ago, and her
recent sacriﬁces with the United States and others
in Korea, ﬁnally demonstrated its worth. How-
ever, no system, not even that of collective secu-
rity, can succeed unless there is not only a ﬁrm
determination to apply it universally both in
space and time, but also whatever be the cost.
Having successfully applied the system of collec-
tive security in Korea, we must now, wherever in
the world the peace is threatened, pursue its ap-
plication more resolutely than ever and with
courageous acceptance of its burdens. We have
the sacred duty to our children to spare them
the sacriﬁces which we have known. I call upon
the world for determination fearlessly to apply
and to accept—as you and as we have accepted
them—the sacriﬁces of collective security.
It is here that our common Christian heritage
unites two peoples across the globe in a commu-
nity of ideals and endeavor. Ethiopia seeks only
to afﬁrm and broaden that cooperation between
peace-loving nations.
TEXTS OF TOASTS
President Elsenhower
YOUR Mams'rr, Lamas AND GENTLEMEN: Dur-
ing the past century and a half, there have been
entertained within these walls many individuals
of distinction—some of our own country, some
visiting us from abroad. I think it is safe to say
that never has any company here gathered been
honored by the presence in their guest of honor
of an individual more noted for his ﬁerce defense
of freedom and for his courage in defending the
independence of his people than the guest of
honor this evening.
I read once that no individual can really be
known to have eatness until he has been tested
in adversity. y this test, our guest of honor
has established new standards in the world. In
5 years of adversity, with his country overrun but
never conquered, he never lost for one single sec-
ond his dignity. He never lost his faith in him-
self, in his people, and in his God.
I deem it a very great privilege, ladies and
gentlemen, to ask you to rise and with me to drink
a toast to His Imperial Majesty, the Emperor of
Ethiopia.
I thank you, Mr. President, for the kind senti-
ments which you have expressed on this occasion,
because I take them, not as addressed to me, but to
my beloved people.
I have accepted your kind invitation, Mr. Pres-
ident, to come to the United States and visit your
nation, because it has offered me the occasion to
express the depth of my appreciation and that of
my people for your friendship and assistance
which encouraged and aided us in resuming our
march on the road of progress from which we
had been detained by the imperatives of war. That
assistance is today, in yet more varied forms,
strongly impelling us forward on the path of
progressive development.
By your great comprehension of the problems
with which Ethiopia is faced, it has been pos-
sible for us to achieve, with your help, consider-
able progress in the solution of the present hour.
The smoothness of this collaboration, notwith-
standing the barriers of distance and language,
and the breadth and richness of our relations at-
tained during the half-century to which you, Mr.
President, have alluded, constitute the supreme
manifestation of that extraordinary ﬂexibility of
understanding and felicity of spirit with which
you, as a nation, have been endowed, and of the
trust and conﬁdence which you inspire in the
minds of others.
I raise my glass to the men and women of the
great and noble American nation, and to its heroic
and distinguished chief, President Eisenhower,
and, last but not least, to his consort and wife,
who so charmingly represents in her person the
women of the United States and the role which
they play in giving leadership to American
thoughts and ideals throughout the world.
