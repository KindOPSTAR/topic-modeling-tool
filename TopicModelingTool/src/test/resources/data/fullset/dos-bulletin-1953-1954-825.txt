ADDRESS BY HAILE SELASSIE I1
I count it a privilege to address what is one of
the greatest parliaments in the world today—
where the forces that make reat one of the most
owerful of nations have een and are being
rought to bear and where issues of worldwide
importance have been decided.
he extent of that power and inﬂuence and the
rapidity with which you have reached such a sum-
mit of im ortance for the rest of the world are un-
parallele in world history and beg ar all con-
ceivable comparisons. Two hundre ears ago
today, as I am speaking Gen. George \ ashin on
won the battle of Fort llecessity, a victory w ich
was but a step in the adual forging together of
the United States. at a phenomenal progress
has been made in that interval of 200 years, an
interval which—you may pardon me as representa-
tive of one of the most ancient nations in the
world—is surely but a surprisingly short passage
of time.2 ‘
So great are your power and wealth that the
budget of a single American city often equals that
of an entire nation.
As in the case of other countries, you gave us
lend-lease assistance during the war and, at
present both mutual security and technical assist-
ance. Yet, so vast are your power and resources
that even after deducting all expenses of the Fed-
eral Government, you have met the costs of this

assistance in one quarter of an hour-15 minutes-—
of our annual production.
6f what interest is it to you then, you may well
ask, that I, the head of what must be for you a
small and remote country, should appear before
you in the midst of your deliberations. I do not
take it upon myself to oint out why Ethiopia is
im ortant to the United)States-—that you can best
ju e for yourselves, but, rather, to ex lain to you
wit brevity, the circumstances w ich make
Ethiopia a si iﬁcant factor in world olitics.
Since so muc of world politics is, to ay, in-
ﬂuenced by the decisions w ich ou, Members of
Congress, reach, here in these ha ls, it is, perhaps,
ifiot unimportant that I set out these considerations
or on.
Aymoment ago, I remarked that, for you, Ethi-
opia must appear to be a small and remote country.
Of course, both of these terms are urely relative.
In fact, so far as size is concernedi Ethiopia has
exactly the area and population of your entire
Paciﬁc far west consisting of the States of Cali-
fornia, Oregon, Washington, and also Idaho.
We are remote, perhaps, only in the sense that
we enjoy a secure pos1tion on the high plateau
of East Africa protected by the Red Sea and our
mountain fastnesses. However, by the numerous
airlines that link us with the rest of the world, it
is possible to arrive in Washington from Addis
Ababa in less than 2 days.
By one of those stran e parallels of history,
Ethiopia and a certain we‘ll-known countr of the
Far East who both enjoy highly defensible and
strategic positions in their respective areas of the
world, both for similar reasons, simultaneously,
at the beginning of the 17th century, entered upon
a 200-year period of isolation. As in the case
of the other country, that isolation came to an
end in the latter half of the 19th century, with
this difference that, upon abandoning her policy
of isolation, Ethiopia was immediately called
upon to defend against tremendous odds her
thousand-year~old inde endence. Indeed, so bit-
ter has been this strugg e against foreign aggran-
dizement that were it not for our persistence and
for the enormous social, economic, and material
advances that Ethiopia has made in the interval,
and particularly since the close of the last war,
