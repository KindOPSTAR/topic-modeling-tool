U.S.—U.K.-French Discussions on

U.S.-U.K. Statement
Press release 192 dated April 18
- Followin
Secretary
Eden:
At the conclusion of their meetin s in London
on April 12 and 13, during which t ey discussed
a number of matters of common concern, Mr. John
Foster Dulles and Mr. Anthony Eden issued the
following statement:
-.We have had a full exchange of views with
reference to Southeast Asia. We deplore the fact
is the text of a joint statement by
ulles and Foreign Secretary Anthony
that on the eve of the Geneva Conference the
Communist forces in Indochina are increasingly
developing their activities into a large-scale war
against the forces of the French Union. They
seek to overthrow the lawful and friendly Gov-
ernment of Viet-Nam which we recognize; and
they have invaded Laos and Cambodia. We re-
alize that these activities not only threaten those
now directly involved, but also endanger the peace
and security of the entire area of Southeast Asia
and the Western Paciﬁc, where our two nations
and other friendly and allied nations have vital
interests.
Accordingly we are ready to take part, with the
other countries princi ally concerned, in an ex-
amination of the possiEiIit of establishing a col-
lective defense, within the ramework of the Char-
ter of the United Nations, to assure the peace,
security and freedom of Southeast Asia and the
Western Paciﬁc.
It is our hope that the Geneva Conference will
lead to the restoration of peace in Indochina. \Ve
believe that the prospect of establishing a unity
of defensive pur ose throughout Southeast Asia
and the Western aciﬁc will contribute to an hon-
orable peace in Indochina.
We have also discussed developments in the ﬁeld
of atomic energy. It will be recalled that on
March 19 the Soviet Ambassador in Washington
was handed by the Secretary of State of the
United States a concrete proposal elaborating on
that portion of President isenhower’s speech
of December 8, 1953, before the General Assem-
bly of the United Nations which dealt with the
subject of peaceful use of atomic energy. The
Government of the United Kingdom, together
with several other friendly nations concerned,
had been consulted and had concurred in the
terms of the concrete proposal before it was given
to the Soviet Government. No reply has yet been
received from that overnment, which is study-
ing the proposal. e also noted that the British
Representative to the United Nations in New
York, with the support of the United States and
French Representatives, had suggested that a
call be issued for an early meeting of the sub-
committee of the Disarmament Commission of
the United Nations.
