tions Technical Assistance Pledging Conference
on February 26, 1953, stated that the program
could be “a powerful force for the development of
latent resources, both human and physical,” and
noted that, in contrast to certain governments
which spoke loudly of their interest in under-
develo ed countries, but did nothin about it, the
Unite States for some 25 years hag participated
in bilateral rograms of assistance and had con-
tributed to the United Nations program from its
inception. Approximately 1,000 experts from the
United Nations were now at work, and the pro-
gram was already producing results, as in locust
control in the Near East, and in Asia, Africa, and
Latin America, where animal diseases had de-
prived millions of people of necessary nutrition.
Ambassador Lode also noted that “in the great
arid and semiari areas of the world, exploration
and technical operations” were “bringing water
to the surface for the livelihood of countless men,
women, and children.” In other areas, “swamps,
and lowlands” were “being drained and con-
trolled—with a resulting drop in malaria and a
rise in food production.” Moreover, “extension
programs” were “bringing the ﬁndings of agricul-
tural science to the individual farmer and showing
him how to put them to work.”
In concluding his remarks, Ambassador Lodge,
on behalf of the United States pledged-—
a maximum of $14,708,750 to the Expanded Program of
Technical Assistance for the calendar year 1953 provided
that the United States pledge does not exceed 60 percent
of the total pledges made by all governments for this
period.
In the end 63 Governments pledged $20,863,575
toward the goal of $25,000,000, and, at 60 percent
of the total pledges at the Third Technical As-
sistance Conference, the American contribution
would total $12,518,145.“
Henry Ford II ex ressed similar sentiments in
the General Assemb y on October 2, 1953,” when
he reafﬁrmed the American belief in the United
Nations program, and indicated that the United
States had carried “a major share of the burden,
about eight times more than the next largest con-
tributor.” As Mr. Ford stated, the United States
was “not interested in exploiting anybody,” but
was “interested in the mutual advantages which
flow from an unfettered exchange of skills, goods,
and ideas with other peoples. This is neither al-
truism nor imperialism—it is simply enlightened
self-interest.” He believed that the program’s
funds should be concentrated so that whatever jobs
were undertaken would be done well, and he looked
forward to the day when the “concept of technical
assistance” could “have a program more adequate
to its needs,” for “technical assistance” was “a
solid bridge between the miseries of the past and
the hopes for the future.”
The United States also contributed heavily to
the capital of the International Bank for Recon-
struction and Development, which has assisted in
ﬁnancing a large number of development projects.
By June 30, 1953, out of an authorized capital of
$10,000,000,000, the subscribed capital totaled
$9,036,500,000. The total paid-in subscription of
the United States totaled $635,000,000 and was
available to the Bank for lending purposes. By
