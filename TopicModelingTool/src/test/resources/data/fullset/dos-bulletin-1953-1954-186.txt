b. The ﬁrst report should also set forth progress
made through recent administrative action in
simplifying customs procedures, includin meas-
ures taken in accordance with the Customs impli-
ﬁcation Act of 1953.
In connection with the application of antidump-
ing duties, the task of determining, in accordance
With the provisions of existin law, “that an in-
dustry in the United States is being or is likel to
be in]ured . . .” b foreign dumpin , shoul be
transferred from t e Department of 516 Treasury
to the Tariﬂ' Commission. The De artment of the
Treasury should be directed to stu y and report to
the Congress on any statutory amendments which
may be needed to permit the continuance of ship-
ments pending investigation of suspected dump-
ing; and at the same time it should re rt on an
measures needed to effect speedier an more e -
cient operation of antiduinping provisions in
pro r cases.
e President should study appropriate meth-
ods to assure that American industry is not in-
jured by embargoes upon or other impediments
to exports of raw materials to the United States
for use in processing here. In this connection, he
should direct the Department of the Treasury to
review the effectiveness of existing countervailing-
duty provisions of the law, should consider any
alternative measures which may be available for
achieving this purpose, and if necessary should
make appropriate recommendations to the Con-
ess.
grOur policy of nondiscrimination in trade mat-
ters, as reﬂected in our unconditional most-
favored-nation policy, should not be chan ed.
The organizational provisions of the eneral
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade should be rene-
gotiated with a view to conﬁning the functions of
the contracting parties to sponsoring multilateral
trade negotiations, recommending broad trade
licies for individual consideration by the legis-
ative or other appro riate authorities in the var-
ious countries, an providin a forum for
consultation regarding trade disputes. The or-
ganizational provisions renegotiated in accordance
with this recommendation should be submitted to
the Congress for approval either as a treaty or by
joint resolution.
The President’s power to negotiate trade agree-
ments under the Trade Agreements Act and to
place them in force should be extended for not less
than 3 years, with appropriate safeguards. Such
a period should give time for considering the
effects of the recommendations for action here and
of the actions taken abroad to restore multilateral
trade and payments as in the past, and for Con-
gress to give adequate consideration to the rene-
gotiated organizational provisions of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, as recommended
above. Consideration should then be given to
extending the Trade Agreements Act for a longer
February 8, I954
period than 3 years, with such safeguards as expe-
rience then indicates to be necessary.
The President should be delegated broad powers
under the Trade Agreements Act to enter into
multilateral negotiations lookin toward a reduc-
tion of tariff rates on a gradual asis. The Presi-
dent’s power to increase rates should not thereby
be curtailed. The President should be authorized
for the 3 years following the renewal of the act
to reduce tariff rates to the following extent:
a. Pursuant to multilateral trade agreement ne-
gotiation, the President should be authorized to
reduce existing tariff rates by not more than 5
percent of present rates in each of the ﬁrst 3
years of the new act.
b. On the basis of information provided by the
Tariff Commission, the President should be au-
thorized, with or without receiving reciprocal con-
cessions, to reduce tariffs by not more than one-
half of rates in effect January 1, 1945, on products
which are not bein imported or which are being
imported in negligi le volume. Any such reduc-
tions should be made in steps spread over a period
of 3 ears.
0. he President should be authorized to reduce
to 50 percent ad valorem, or its equalent, an
rate in excess of that ceilin , except that any suc
reduction should take place y stages over a period
of 3 ears.
(1. eductions in rates pursuant to the foregoing
should not be cumulative as to any commodity.
e. In the exercise of these owers, the existing
prenegotiation procedures, inc uding public notice
and hearings before the Tariff Commission and
before an interdepartmental committee, should be
followed and peril point determinations should be
made. Moreover, the provisions of the esca e
clause should apply to tariﬂ' reductions made un er
this authority.
In extending the tariff-negotiating authority of
the President, the Congress should direct that in
future negotiations subdivisions of classiﬁcation
categories which would give rise to new confusion
or controversy over classiﬁcation be avoided to the
maximum extent ible.
The President 5 ould make an annual report to
the Congress on the o ration of the trade agree-
ments program inclu ing information on new ne-
gotiations undertaken, changes made in tariff rates,
and reciprocal concessions obtained.
The escape clause and the peril point provisions
should be retained. However, the statute should
be amended expressly to spell out the fact that
the President is authorized to disregard ﬁndings
under these provisions whenever he ﬁnds that the
national interest of the United States requires it.
The same standards of sanitation and health
should be applied to imported as to domestic
goods. Plants and animal quarantine provisions
should be maintained. The desirability of con-
