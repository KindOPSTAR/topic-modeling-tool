The Unltlng for Peace Resolution
Korea—the acid test—proved that had there not
been provision for collective action against aggres-
sion, the charter concept of peaceful change would
have been meaningless. Therefore, followin the
Korean aggression, the Uniting for Peace ~so-
lution ‘ develo (1 new procedures to deal in the
future with threats to the mace where Security
Council action was im ossib e because of the veto.
These procedures ena le the United Nations to
prepare in advance for dealing with active and
potential breaches of the peace, and to deal with
them ﬂexibly. Possibl a more important conse-
quence of the Uniting or Peace Resolution is that
it acts as a ps chological deterrent to the otential
aggressor, 1n uencing it to accept proce ures for
peaceful change.
The United Nations as an instrument of peace-
ful chan also encourages orderly progress to-
ward sel - overnment or inde endence, and strives
to develop igher living stan ards, and to broaden
human r1 hts.
The Unlted Nations Charter provides the means
to channel into a constructive pattern the drive
for national inde ndence whose ent-up emo-
tions were release so violently in t e immediate
postwar period. In the past 8 years, over 600 mil—
ion people have achieved independence. many
under the direct auspices of the United Nations.
In Indonesia and Israel, the United Nations cut
short the violent phase of the struggles for inde-
pendence and shepherded these countries to full
recognition as United Nations members. In other
areas, the moral force of the charter has acted as
a spur to hasten the grant of independence. Many
other areas are continuing to progress toward a
fuller measure of self-government under the aegis
of the United Nations.
United Nations activity in the ﬁeld of dependent
peoples quite naturally often raises the uestion
of whether the availability of the United ations
as a forum does not actually encourage more ex-
treme demands for immediate self-rule. This may
sometimes be the case. More often, however—
and this is our goal in all cases—the United Na-
tions acts as a constructive inﬂuence upon na-
tionalistic forces which might otherwise erupt in
a violent manner.
Irresponsible acts by terrorists, such as regret-
tably occurred only a few hours a 0 when several
Congressmen were wounded on t e ﬂoor of the
House of Representatives, are as inexcusable as
they are deplorable. I know that you all join with
me in expressing our sense of shoe at this act and
our feelings of deepest sympathy for the victims
of this tragedy.
I come now to one of the most important
factors in promoting peaceful change—the United
Nations effort to improve conditions of living in
areas needing help. This is a challenge to all of
us. Failure to make pro ress here breeds dis-
content and instability an even on occasion vio-
lence.
On many fronts and in many countries United
Nations a encies are actively at work to help the
peoples 0? those countries to improve their own
iving conditions. The technical-assistance pro]-
ects of the United Nations are laying a key role:
to increase the productivity 0 the land, to bring
new standards of health and physical well-being,
to break down the walls of ignorance and super-
stition, to begin little b little the promotion of
industry and trade. A read we can see some
marked and lasting gains. ut chieﬂy we must
regard these as ﬁrst steps in a long-range invest-
ment which the future will make increasingly pro-
ductive.
The successful efforts of the specialized agencies
hint at what economic gains can be ex ected from
United Nations rograms. The Woriil Bank has
lent almost 2 bi lion dollars to 32 countries and
territories since it began operations. A typical
project is a new power plant, ﬁnanced by the Bank,
which is being opened in San Salvador. This
power plant will double the country’s electric-
power supply, feed power to new industries, make
possible t e pumping of water for farm irrigation,
and bring lighting to homes and schools which
have never known an electric bulb.
Or, take the recent World Bank loan of 71/2
million dollars to India to help in the reclama-
tion of well over a million acres devastated by a
crop strangling weed. When this project is com-
pleted, the reclaimed area will produce an esti-
mated one-half million additional tons of wheat
each year which would cost the equivalent of 35
million dollars annually to import.
There are other signiﬁcant results from the
work of the specialized agencies. For instance,
an FAO rogram costing $40,000 to stimulate use
of h brig seed added 24 million dollars to the value
of t 1e Euro ean corn crop in 1952. By bringin
malaria un er control in Asia, WHO has opens
up previously uninhabitable areas to immigration
and productlon.
These programs are sometimes criticized as being
too limited and there is constant pressure for more
ambitious programs. President Eisenhower, as
you know, is keenly aware of the need for eco-
nomic advances. In his April 16 speech, he set
forth a pledge to devote to economic development
a part of the funds which might be saved through
disarmament.‘ Last December, the President, re-
alizing the otential beneﬁts to be derived from
the peacefu use of atomic energy, made his
now world-acclaimed proposal to the General
Assembly.“
When we speak of peaceful change, we also in-
clude the gradual and pro essive realization of
the human rights goals 0 the United Nations.
