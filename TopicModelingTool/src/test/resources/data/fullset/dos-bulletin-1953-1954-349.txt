In South Asia, where there were grave threats to
freedom and independence, “the preservation of
free governments and institutions and the con-
tinued adherence of this area to the free world”
were “of critical importance to the security of the
United States.”
As submitted to the Congress on May 5, 1953,
President Eisenhower’s requested authorization
was for some $4,024,523,000, of which $425,812,637
was to go to the Near East and Africa, $397,412,-
637 for military material and training, and the
major portion to Greece and Turkey. In an ac-
companying message to the Congress '7 President
Eisenhower stated “certain clear conclusions” with
respect to the roblem as a whole, amon others,
that “we must elp the free nations to he p them-
selves in eradicating conditions which corrode and
destroy the will for freedom and democracy from
within.” In the end, the Mutual Security Act,
which was signed on July 16, 1953, authorized
$396,250,000 to provide military assistance to
Greece, Turkey, and Iran, and $50,000,000 for
military assistance for the general area of the Near
East and Africa. It also authorized some $50,-
000,000 for economic and technical assistance in
the Near East and Africa, $50,000,000 for the Arab
refugees from Palestine and refugees coming into
Israel, and $194,000,000 for special economic as-
sistance in the area as a whole. The sum of $94,-
400,000 was authorized for assistance to India and
Pakistan. The Mutual Security Appropriation
Act, signed on August 7, 1953, however, designated
$270,000,000 in military assistance, mostly for
Greece and Turkey, and $33,792,500 for technical
and economic assistance in the Near East and
Africa, special economic assistance being reduced
to $147,000,000, the Palestine refugee program to
$44,063,250, and assistance to India and Pakistan
to $75,000,000. Moreover, the U.S. contribution
to multilateral technical cooperation (largely
under the United Nations) was reduced to $9,500,-
000 and that to UNICEF to $9,500,000.68

In the President’s budget message of January 21, 1954,
net expenditures for economic and technical development
in ﬁscal year 1955 were estimated at $1,028.000,000, which
reﬂected proportionately greater emphasis on programs
in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. With respect to the
Near East, the budget provided assistance to the Arab
refugees through the United Nations and for technical
assistance and supplementary development in the Arab
States, Israel, and Iran. (See BULLETIN of Feb. 1, 1954,
p. 147.)
These ﬁgures however should be set in the
perspective of the total of American foreign aid
since 1941, in general, and more particularly since
the end of the war. Thus, between 1941 and ﬁscal
year 1953, the gross foreign aid of the United
States reached no less than $84 348,000,000 in
grants and credits, the net being 982,276,000900
while the total between July 1, 1945, and the end
of ﬁscal year 1953 reached $45,124,000,000 oss,
0r $41,348,000,000 net. For the Near East, outh
Asia, and Africa the total between 1941 and the
end of ﬁscal year 1953 was approximately $3,353,-
000,000 gross, or $2,922,000,000 net, distributed
generally as shown in the chart.“
U.S. Technlcel end Ecenemlc Assistance Programs
Most of the basic agreements for technical co-
operation between the United States and the coun-
tries of the Near East, South Asia, and Africa were
concluded during 1950—1951, although there have
been many s eciﬁc a eements since that time!0
A few examp es may e taken from this manifold
program of assistance to illustrate the kinds of
proJects which are being carried out.
Greece, Turkey, and Irate—Greece and Turkey
have been the subject of special programs of as-
sistance, designed to strengthen their defensive
positions wit a view to preserving their inde-
endence in a highly important area of the world.
goth have received large-scale economic beneﬁts
from American assistance, of which village recon-
struction in Greece and road construction in
Turkey may be taken as particular illustrations.n
Iran has been the recipient of technical assistance,
on the other hand, in addition to the emergency
assistance extended in the summer of 1953, of
which note has already been made."
