For this very reason, it is necessary to recognize that the
aim of all peace-loving states is not restricted to alloca-
tion of some small part of atomic materials for peaceful
purposes. It is essential that not a certain part, but the
entire mass of atomic materials be used wholly for peace
ful purposes which might open unprecedented possibilities
for the development of industry, agriculture, and trans-
port, for the application of very valuable atomic discov-
eries in medicine, for the improvement of techniques in all
areas where applied, and for further and greater scien-
tiﬁc progress. Consequently, one should also take into
account the fact that the prohibition of atomic and hydro-
gen weapons and the use of all atomic materials for the
peaceful need of the people, taken together with proper
concern for the needs of economically weaker areas, would
at the same time facilitate the possibility of obtaining
agreement on the question of decisive reduction in con-
ventional armaments. This, in turn, would lead to a
tremendous alleviation of the tax burden which people are
bearing in connection with the existence in many states
of swollen armies, air forces, navies, i. e., in connection
with the armament race which is continuing at present.
All this requires recognition of the necessity for the
prohibition of atomic weapons together with the establish-
ment of international supervision over enforcement of
this prohibition and unconditional renunciation of the
use of this weapon. Therefore, the Soviet Government
will continue to insist upon the urgency of reaching an
appropriate international agreement on this question.
As for the declaration of President Eisenhower con-
cerning conﬁdential or diplomatic conversations in regard
to the proposal made by him, the Soviet Government un-
swervingly following its peace-loving policy expresses its
readiness to take part in these conversations. The Soviet
Government has always attached great importance to
direct conversations between governments with a view to
reaching mutually acceptable agreements on questions in
dispute in the interest of the strengthening of universal
peace.
In this connection the Soviet Government expects that
the Government of the United States in conformity with
its declaration will give the necessary clariﬁcation inas-
much as the proposal of the United States in its substan-
tive parts contains unclear elements and does not envisage
the necessity of the prohibition of atomic weapons nor
envisage either renunciation of use of this Weapon. The
Soviet Government is deeply convinced that humanity
must and can be spared the horrors of atomic war. Spe-
cial responsibility in the decision of this task rests on
those governments which already possess the power of
the atomic weapon. Insofar as the Soviet Union is con-
cerned its position is completely clear. It consists in
turning the great discovery of the human mind not against
civilization but for its all around progress, not to the mass
destruction of peoples but to peaceful needs, for totally
assuring the raising of the wellbeing of the population.
The Soviet Government proceeds from the fact that dur-
ing the course of these discussions there will be examined
simultaneously the following proposal of the Soviet
Government:
States parties to the agreement, motivated by a desire
to reduce international tension, take upon themselves
the solemn and unconditional obligation not to use the
atomic, hydrogen, or other weapon of mass destruction.
The achievement of an international agreement on this
question could be an important step on the road to the
full withdrawal from the armaments of states of atomic,
hydrogen and other forms of weapons of mass destruction
with the establishment of strict international control
guaranteeing the execution of the agreement for prohibi-
tion of the use of atomic energy for military purposes.
The Soviet Union, imbued with deep concern for the pro-
tection of humanity against the death-dealing atomic and
hydrogen weapons, will do everything in its power to the
end that this weapon will never be turned against people.
Facing the New Year
With Conﬁdence
Statement by Secretary Dulles '
As we look ahead, we can have conﬁdence that
the next year will make peace and 'ustice more
secure. During the year that ends, we ave already
made great progress and our society of freedom
has gained in moral initiative over the forces of
reaction.
In Korea the ﬁ hting is ended, and we can look
forward to 1954 ing the ﬁrst year of peace in
Korea since 1949.
In the realm of atomic weapons, President
Eisenhower’s great address before the United
Nations has brought the Soviet Union to agree to
take part in talks which may mean a recession of
the horror of atomic warfare.
The unnatural and dangerous division of Europe
created b the Soviet occupations will, it seems,
now be discussed by the Soviet Union despite its
efforts over past months to evade this topic.
The uniﬁcation of Europe becomes at long last
a. possibility. When, as we expect, this great goal
is achieved, then there will be strength and Vigor
in this home of Western civilization such as it as
never known before.
The problems ahead are many and diilicult. As
we approach them we should all pray for divine
guidance. With that we can have conﬁdence that
next year will indeed be a Happy New Year.
