The Issues at Geneva
Address by Secretary Dulles ‘
I welcome this opportunity to talk with you
about the Conference now going on in Geneva and
the related aspects of our forei policy.
First of all, I join with you In paying tribute
to the gallant defenders of Dien-Bien-Phu. May
it be given us to play a worthy part to defend
the values for which they gave their lives.
This week I returned from the Geneva Con-
ference. My return was not connected with any
developments at the Conference. As long ago as
last February when the Conference was called, I
said I would attend only the o ning sessions, and
then have my place taken b t 0 Under Secretary
of State, General Bedell mith. He is highly
qualiﬁed to head our delegation at Geneva.
Since the Conference may last for some weeks,
I did not feel able to stay with it that long. I
have been out of the United States durin much
of the last 6 months to attend the Bermu a. Con-
ference, the Berlin Conference, the Caracas
Conference, and two NATO Council meetings in
Paris. These meetings strengthen the links with
our allies and enable us to present the position of
the United States to others. But the Secretary of
State must also keep in close touch with our own
people and with the Congress. In order to exer-
cise our full inﬂuence in foreign affairs, the Gov-
ernment must have the understanding and support
of the American people for its policies.
The Geneva Conference has two tasks. The
ﬁrst is to try to find a way to unify Korea. The
second task is to discuss the possibility of restor-
ing peace in Indochina.
The Soviet delegation, however, has sought to
use the Conference for other purposes. By vari-
ous devices, it has tried to create the false im-
pression that this meeting accepted Red China
as one of “ﬁve great powers” or conferred on it
a new international status.
Both of these issues had been fought out in
connection with calling the Conference and the
Soviets had then conceded that the Conference

May 7 (press release 238).
would not be a ﬁve- ower aﬂair nor involve any
recognition for Be China. We and our allies
stood ﬁrm] and solidly on that position and the
Soviets en ed b accepting it.
B the time left Geneva, the Korean hase
of t e Conference had been organized an was
well under way. I will speak ﬁrst of that, and
then of Indochina where the ﬁghtin is still active
and where the question of possible nited States
participation has to be considered.
For many years Korea has been the pawn of
great wers. Russia, Japan, and China have
abuse and ex loited Korea and kept its peoples
in servitude. he Koreans now want only to be
united and free and left alone. Yet, in fact,
Korea is divided, and North Korea lives under
the Chinese Communist yoke. In all decency it
would seem that the Communists should allow
the Korean people at long last to live their own
lives and to satisfy their aspirations for freedom.
When the Geneva Conference was organized,
the Communists put up their program for uniting
Korea. Unhappil it was not a rogram to sat-
isfy the desires of t e Korean peopge for unity and
freedom. It was, as President Eisenhower said,
“a Chinese cop ’ of the Soviet scheme for the
uniﬁcation of German . Their idea is to have
elections so set 11 that t e Communists can dictate
the outcome an thus impose their rule upon the
whole country.
In the case of Germany, the Communists con-
trolled Eastern Germany, with about one-fourth
of the total German pulation. In the case of
Korea, they control a ut one-sixth of the total
Korean pulation. They insist,however, in both
cases, t at this gives them the right to equal
participation in determining the election con-
itions. Also, they stipulate that there must be
no impartial supervision or observation of the
elections to be sure that they are fair and free of
coercion.
The Communists feel conﬁdent that under these
conditions they can make their candidates seem to
wm.
This scheme, when oﬂ'ered for Germany, was
turned dowa by the Federal Republic of Germany
