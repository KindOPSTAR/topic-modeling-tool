Furthermore, our free-world allies must be tied
as closely as possible to us. The stronger our
allies are economically and militarily the better.
But of equal importance is that, weak or strong,
those allies must be tied securely to us. And
mutual trade on a two-way basis is the only effec-
tive way to attract and hold those allies. There
is nothing charitable in this approach. It is based
on cold-blooded self-interest.
We will never seize allies through the Russian
method of milita domination. The ancient
method of rulingffyamily intermarria es is no
longer fashionable or feasible. Gifts an loans are
effective only as long as the money is being ad-
vanced. Once the time of repayment comes, di-
vergent rather than mutual interests are created.
Economic aid and military aid, whether in the
form of grants or loans, were necessary to get our
battered allies back on their feet. Beyond that
they are not so effective. Furthermore, rich as
we are, we cannot afford such lavishness for an
indeﬁnite period. We are not at the end of our
ability in that res ect. We are, however, deﬁ-
nitely aware that t ere must be an end.
There is no closer bond among nations than
the interrelation of economic interests. . . . No
country is so blind that its foreign policy becomes
insensitive to the trading interests of its people.
Wars may start over conﬂicting economic inter-
ests, but alliances are cemented by mutual eco-
nomic interests. The im ortance of mutual trade
in cementing alliances s ould be obvious. Even
our Communist enemies have harnessed their
trade policies to their military and foreign policies.
It is a miracle that here in the United States the
close connection between trade and allied military
strength has been so often missed.
There is only one caveat in this move toward
freer mutual trade between us and our allies. We
must not pursue mutual trade to the point that
we injure our strong and vigorous domestic econ-
omy. The productlve capacity of the United
States is clearly one of the main pillars—if not the
foundation—upon which the military and eco-
nomic strength of the free world now rests and
will rest for many years to come. That founda-
tion cannot be shattered or seriously weakened.
Consequently the only danger spot to watch is not
to let a freer trade policy injure the basic economy
and defense structures of the United States. That
result will hurt us and our allies alike.
Trade and a Strong Don-nestle Economy
It is clearly possible to achieve both our objec-
tives, mutual trade with our allies and an overall
strong domestic economy. Our economy is not so
frail that it will injure easily. We will not be
able to please all of our allies all of the time. We
will not be able to satisfy all of our industrialists
all of the time. Increased international commerce
will inconvenience—and perhaps hurt—some of
our industries. It will stimulate others. Our
aim must be to maintain overall industrial
strength rather than the status quo of each existing
industry irrespective of its contribution to our
military strength.
It is foolish to argue that the modiﬁcation of
existin restrictions on forei trade can be accom-
plishe without any domestic dislocations. Some
industries owe their entire existence to trade bar-
riers. To the extent that they are militarily essen-
tial, some restrictions will have to be maintained.
To the extent that they are not essential, our atti-
tude toward the trade barriers should be judged
solely by the effect on our allies.
Obviously, substantial quantities of electrical
equipment or cutlery cannot be im orted without
some market upset on the part 0 the domestic
manufacturers of such electrical equipment or
cutlery. Some individual ﬁrms, industries, and
erha s communities will ﬁnd their paths more
iﬁicu t with vigorous competition from abroad.
Some upsets wil be temporary, and other changes
in our industrial pattern may well be more er-
manent. To refuse to recognize such probabili-
ties would be foolish. Yet calamity does not lie
ahead. The balance between our allies and basic
industrial strength at home can be preserved. I
believe that. if we face reality, we can, both na-
tionally and privately, alleviate and overcome the
effects of freer international trade.
Our industries are not without experience in
meeting derangements. The advances 1n engineer-
ing, electrical, and mechanical developments have
produced minor industrial revolutions in which
whole industries have disappeared. Yet our over-
all economy has grown stronger. Our military
otential has increased. The machine with its
abor-expanding capabilities was fought for many
years so ely because of its dislocatin effect on
groups of workers and individual ski s. Shifts
in fuels—the simple changeover of a furnace from
coal to oil—have roduced industrial upsets of
deep penetration. e cannot stop such chan es.
An we would not stop them if we could. TVs
have surmounted those difﬁculties, and with
patience and intelligence we can do so again.
It is hard to believe that the effects of freer
international trade will be more revolutionary
than the advent of the automobile. No national
legislature rushed with sales taxes or tariffs to the
protection of the bicycle or wagon industry. The
transition from a protected economy to a freer
economy, particularly when nationally assisted,
should be Simpler.
There is also a compensating factor in the ex-
pansion of international commerce. Other nations
will become economically stronger. Such in-
creased economic stren h will bring higher stand-
ards of living in suc foreign countries. The
mass markets available to us and our allies will
expand. New markets will open to our existing
in ustries. New industries may be stimulated into
being. If this trade pattern is followed through-
