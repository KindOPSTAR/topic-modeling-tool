siderin amendment of the Route Annex
of the .S.-Canada Air Transport Agree-
ment.
It was agreed that the Civil Aeronautics Board
would issue to Trans-Canada Air Lines a six
months’ renewable permit for Montreal-Mexico
City ﬂights making nontraﬁic stops at Tampa. In
the special circumstances, the Can also agreed
that Tca might, for reasons of economy, utilize
the same aircraft and schedules for the Montreal-
Tampa portion of such ﬂights as are used for the
Montreal-Tampa services operated by that car-
rier under the Air Transport Agreement.
The Canadian representatives had indicated
their desire that Trans-Canada be permitted to
combine its Montreal—Tampa o )erations under the
Air Transport Agreement and Montreal-Mexico
Cit operations, with a technical sto at Tampa,
un er the International Air Servwes Transit
Agreement for a temporary period until aircraft
and facilities for nonstop operations between
Canada and Mexico become available. The rep-
resentatives of the United States made known
their desire to cooperate with Canada in helping
Tca resolve its operational problem, stating that,
in the circumstances, such cooperation did not
imply a departure from the established policy of
the United States in the ﬁeld of international
aviation.
The spirit of cooperation was carried into the
discussion regarding the operations of US. car-
riers which have been under review by the Cana-
dian authorities, and it was agreed that Pan
American World Airways and Colonial Airlines
should be permitted to continue their respective
combined services throu h Canadian points and
that the Air Transport card would vacate the
outstandin show-cause orders.
With regerence to the present network of air
routes between the United States and Canada, it
was understood that the Canadian Government
will, within the next few months, bring forward
proposals looking toward a review of the route
schedules of the bilateral air agreement.

‘ For earlier correspondence on this subject, see Bur.-
uz'nn of Aug. 24, 1953, p. 244.
Secretary of State for External Aﬂ'airs, Paul
Martin, stated that, as a temporary measure, Can-
ada would limit its shi ments of oats to this coun-
try to 23 million buslie 5 during the period Decem-
ber 10, 1953, to October 1, 1954.
The United States Tariﬂ' Commission had
recommended to the President that im orts of
oats should be limited, in accordance wit proce-
dure authorized under section 22 of the Agricul-
tural Adjustment Act, to 23 million bushels in
the 12-month period beginning October 1, 1953.”
The President has now found that no action by
the United States limiting imports of oats need
be taken to protect our domestic agricultural pro-
gram, authorized under the Agricultural Act of
1949, a ainst the threat of imports.
The resident, in expressing his satisfaction
with the Canadian reply, indicated that be con-
curs with Canada’s understanding that, should
substantial quantities of oats be imported into the
United States from other sources during the speci-
ﬁed period, the situation would be subject to re-
view by both the United States and Canada.
The texts of the letters follow.
Acting Secretary Smith to the Canadian Secre-
tary of State for External Affairs, December 7
MY DEAR Ma. Sscas'raar:
During the ast several months, the Govern-
ment of the nited States has been faced with
problems of increasing seriousness in connection
with the accumulation of surplus agricultural
products. These mounting surpluses, and the
nancial burden the entail, may well threaten to
disturb orderly marllieting arrangements which it
is to the interest of both Canada and the United
States to maintain.
The special circumstances affecting the problem
of oats make it a matter of particular urgency re-
quiring exceptional treatment. We believe that
unless steps are taken to assure that imports of
oats will not be such as to interfere with the
order] marketing of oats in the United States, a
critical situation will develo which could be
damaging to the farming industry of our two
countries. It is our suggestion that shipments of
oats from Canadian ports of shipment to the
United States should not exceed 23 million bushels
during the riod from midnight December 10,
1953 to mi night September 30, 1954. As you
know, Canada supplies almost the whole of United
States imports of oats and only small quantities
come from other countries.
You are, of course, aware that the lar er prob-
lems associated With accumulations of; surplus
agricultural products and related' questions of
agricultural policy are currently under review
with the aim of arriving at longer-term solutions
of a constructive character.
'Copies of the report on oats may be obtained at the
otiices ot the United States Tax-ii! Commission.
