Exhibition of Peaceful Uses
of Atomic Energy
Following is the text of a message from Presi-
dent Eisenhower which was read by Clare Booth
Luce, Ambassador to Italy, on the occasion of the
inauguration at Rome on June 15 of the world-
wide program by the United States Information
Agency to exhibit peaceful uses of atomic energ ,
together with remarks made by Mrs. Luce on t
same occasion.
MESSAGE FROM PRESIDENT EISENHOWER
We have only recently passed the midpoint of
the 20th century. Yet I am convinced that history
will one day record as the most far-reaching physi-
cal accomplishment of all this century—or even
of 20 centuries—the discoveries which in recent
ears unlocked, for the use of mankind, the bound-
ess energy of the atom.
From among the numberless generations which
have peopled this planet destiny has called upon
those now livin to reach deciswns on the use of
nuclear energy t at will govern, in major measure,
the future of mankind. Never before has man’s
wisdom and vision been so supreme] tested.
Never again ma man have so extraor inar an
opportunit for is own betterment or so aw 111 a
res onsibility for his own fate.
0 great is this opportunity, so grave this re-
sponsibility, that all rational humans are moved
humbly to pra that this new knowledge may be
used in its ful ness—for peace, for progress, for
freedom.
It is in this spirit that the Atom for Peace
Exhibit is being inaugurated in Rome by Am-
bassador Luce.
REMARKS BY AMBASSADOR LUCE
It is a pleasant honor to welcome you here to-
night for the inauguration of this exhibition of
peaceful uses of atomic energy. The display you
will see is presented in the hope that it may con-
tribute to wider public understanding of the po-
tentialities favorable to the welfare of mankind
that exist in this new ﬁeld of science. I know you
will ﬁnd it of interest and value. On behalf of my
Government, I should like to take this opportun-
ity to express our sincere appreciation for the very
klnd assistance that has been provided b the
Governments of Italy, France, and the Ulhited
Kingdom in order that this exhibition could be
constructed and shown to the public.
Let us hope that this example of coo eration
will be a propitious augury for the future evelop-
ment of atomic ener throughout the world. For
there is surely no su ject of international concern
for which cooperation between nations is more
necessary, if mankind is to progress in peace.
The American Government and people deeply
desire to achieve closer collaboration in this ﬁeld
with all other nations. We believe that only thus
can mankind enjoy the full beneﬁts offered by this
great new source of energy.
We regard the peaceful applications of atomic
energy as a new sunrise on the world horizon.
We wish its rays might pierce throu h and dissi-
pate the cloud of danger created by t e failure of
nations thus far to achieve international control
of nuclear ower. We believe that our hopes and
fears are shared by people of good will in ever
nation. On the foundation of these shared fee ~
ings we trust that there can be built, with patience
and understanding, a strong system of interna-
tional coo eration.
In that ope, I welcome you to this exhibition.
