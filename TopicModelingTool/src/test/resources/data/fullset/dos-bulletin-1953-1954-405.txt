Caracas:
STATEMENT BY SECRETARY DULLES
Press release 128 dated March 10
I have sought the rivilege of sittin with this
economic committee ause the prob ems which
we face here in the Americas are as much economic
as they are political.
It is sometimes said that we must seek economic
welfare for the reason that that is the best defense
a ainst communism. I, myself, would put it
diﬁerently. We seek economic welfare because,
here in the Americas, we believe that all human
beings, without regard to race, religion, or class
should have the opportunity to develop in body,
mind, and spirit. That can happen only in a
healthy society. Therefore, we seek it as some—
thing which is good in itself, not merely as a de-
fens1ve mechanism against communism.
Diﬂ'erent nations develop their economies in
different ways. That is natural and as it should
be. We do not believe in a world of conformity.
We believe that there is a richness in diversity.
Just as this universe in which we live was created
as a universe of diversity, so the human institu-
tions which man builds are roperly diverse, to
take account of human and) geographical dif-
ferences.
In the United States we have a political system
and an economic system which we believe to be
good. At least, we are convinced that they serve
well our particular needs.
We do not claim that our economy is perfect.
In the past, business cycles, sometimes of great
severity, have brought misery upon many people
at home and abroad for reasons which they them-
selves could not control. There have been seg-
ments of our people who have not received
the great and sacred heritage which those patriots
entrusted to our hands. May we play our part so
that we too shall be honored by those who come
after us.
ad uate opportunity and who have not been re-
waiiihed in accordance with their merits.
We are constantly striving to make our society
better by applying the lessons of experience. We
do not believe that there exists, any more, the risk
of great de ressions as part of an inevitable cycle.
Also the agundant productivity of our economy
is steadily being spread to beneﬁt more and more
people.
All this is being done within the framework of
a free enterprise economy which places a primary
res onsibilit upon private effort. In this way we
see to deve op a population of individuals who
work hard, who invent, who save, who share. We
recognize that, as social and economic problems
grow in magnitude and complexity, so govern-
ment has to assume increasing supervisory tasks.
Nevertheless, the United States continues to place
its primary dependence upon individual effort and
upon private capital.
Our society is by no means a self-contained so-
ciety. We know that for our present well-being,
and the increasing of that well-being with others,
foreign trade plays an important part in our econ-
omy. We know that it plays an even more im-
portant part in the economy of many friendly
nations. We shall, therefore, strive to give to
trade the dependability which it deserves.
Many of you feel that some adjustments of
United States economic policies would be mutu-
ally beneﬁcial. You may be right. Certainly,
these are matters which we are prepared to con-
sider openmindedly. That, indeed, is one of the
reasons why we have come here with an impor-
tant economic and ﬁnancial del ation, represent-
ing not only the Department of tate but also the
Treasury. Commerce, and the Export-Import
Bank. We are here to discuss, to study, and to
learn, in line with the traditional United States
policy of constantly taking new ways whenever
we can be conﬁdent that the change is for the
better.
We recognize that, in the economic ﬁeld, it is
more difﬁcult to combine unity with diversity than
it is in the political ﬁeld.
