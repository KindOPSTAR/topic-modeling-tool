A Progress Report on Spanish-American Cooperation
by James Clement Dunn
Ambassador to Spain ‘
One year ago, shortly after my arrival in Spain
as Ambassador, I had the pleasure of being with
you here in this industrial and shipping metro olis
of Spain, the beautiful city of Barcelona, an had
the rivilege of addressing this unique and out-
staniiing organization, the American Chamber of
Commerce in S ain.2
Since then, have learned from personal ob-
servation a great deal concerning our construc-
tive activities, not only here in arcelona but
also in Madrid, Sevill Bilbao, and Valencia.
It is a source of satis action to me as an Ameri-
can that, among approximately 4,000 members, 90
percent are Spaniards, and I am honored as an
American that so many important Spanish busi-
nessmen participate in the American Chamber of
Commerce in Spain.
I also should like particularly to compliment
the American Chamber of Commerce in Spain on
its excellent publication, Spanish-American Trade,
which, with its handsome color photographs and
its many informative articles in both Spanish and
English, is a thoroughly worthwhile magazine
devoted to international commerce.
When I spoke with you last year, the Govern-
ments of Spain and the United States were still
engaged in negotiations with regard to the es-
tablishment of a new relationship between each
other. On September 26 were signed the military
and economic agreements between Spain and the
United States,8 and since then we are embarked
on a path of joint cooperation mutually desired
by both countries. Among the lasting effects of
these agreements of direct interest to the American
Chamber of Commerce is the path they open for
greater association between the Spanish and
American people and the possibility of increased
trade and closer business relations.

merce at Barcelona, Spain, on May 25.

Allocatlons Under Eoonomlc Program
From time to' time during the past months, I
have taken advantage of o portunities such as
this one tonight, to make a rief progress report
on the work that has been accomplished in the
carrying out of this new relationship between
Spain and the United States. I am gratiﬁed to
be able to state to you that we are moving steadily
ahead in both the economic and military programs.
A short time ago it was announced that the ﬁnal
determination of the broad categories recom-
mended to the United States Foreign Operations
Administration for allocation of funds under the
economic rogram had been completed. These
recommen ations have had constantly in mind the
objective on the art of both the Spanish and
United States ant orities involved of accomplish-
ing tihe greatest good for all of Spain and its
peo e.
T e funds devoted to economic aid totaling $85
million will be devoted to ﬁnancing imports into
Spain of a multitude of things that are regarded
as of primary im ortance to the overall economic
development of t e country, as well as to the pro-
vision of technical assistance in various forms. It
is hoped that this technical assistance will not only
provrde an exchange of knowledge in scientiﬁc,
technical, and industrial methods and techniques
that will have an immediate and favorable impact
on the economy, but will provide a sound basis
for the long-range continuing economic develop-
ment of the country.
Perhaps I can give you a better understandin
of how this years $85 million will be used if
try to give you a general picture of what these
funds are intended to accomplish in the various
se ents of the Spanish economy to which they
W1 1 be devoted.
For instance, the largest single eneral cate-
gory of expenditures will be in ustrial raw
materials. lmost $31 million will go to ﬁnance
imports of such vitally needed materials as non-
ferrous metals, cotton, steel products, ferrous
scrap, crude rubber, sulphur, etc. Increased pro-
