In the long pull ahead two “musts” stand out
clearly:
\Ve must maintain and cement the unity of the
free world.
We must maintain and conserve the strength
of that world.
Make no mistake about this. The only security
for free men today and for the foreseea le future
lies in the unity and strength of the free world.
To ether we can meet and overcome this danger.
ﬁlone any one of us would have a tough time
resisting the combined resources and strength of
the Soviet Union and its satellites.
There are no satellites in the free world. We
are equals. To maintain and conserve the unity
of the free world, we have to keep ﬁrmly in mind
that our unit is based on a free partnership.
We, the United States, to be sure, are the
strongest of the partners. But that gives us no
special rights in the partnership. It does, how-
ever, give us responsibilities. We must make very
certain to differentiate between those two words.
This strength of ours is, in a fashion, one of our
weaknesses. It is only human to resent the Big
Fellow, the fortunate one, the man who seems
to have eve thing while you have so little. The
Big Fellow as 1115 tem tations too. Impatience
is one of them. It is on y too easy to be impatient
when one sees something that needs desperately
to be done and it looks as thou h one’s partner
didn’t fully realize the ur ency 0% the situation.
Our partners in the rec-world coalition are
human—we are human. The Soviets seek to play
upon our weaknesses. They seek to use them to
create dissension among us.
The Soviets are only too well aware of the im-
portance to us and the danger to them of the unity
of the free world. Today the rimary objective
of all Communist strate y is to ivide that world.
It is the motivation 0? many of their olicies.
Every word that comes out of Moscow is designed
to contribute to that end. Mr. Molotov went to
Berlin with that end in view. Every lan he
advanced in Berlin had that one unc anging
ob'ective.
he French are unhappy over the situation in
Indochina. Molotov intimated that could be set-
tled. The Europeans need an outlet for their
oods. He suggested that more than a billion
ollars’ worth of trade is waiting them in the
Communist area.
All of the nations ﬁnd the defense program a
burden. He told them that peace under the So-
viets would take care of that.
Constantly he reminded them that the United
States is not Europe. There is no more convinced
advocate of isolationism for the U.S.A. than Mr.
Molotov. As one columnist remarked, he intro-
duced throughout his remarks in Berlin an under-
current of “we Europeans” that very cleverly
excluded the United States.
The Communists are well aware that their great-1
est mistake to date was in arousing the fears that
cemented the free world. They are doing everg-
thing in their power to correct that mistake. T e
Berlin Conference was a very interesting perform-
ance from that angle.
The Berlin Conference, which 'ust closed, was
the most recent demonstration of t ese tactics. A
similar show, however, is on the road throu bout
the free world. “DiV1de and con uer” is o d to-
talitarian strategy. The Communists hope to put
it to work for them.
And, of course, there are differences in the free
world. The very fact that we are free means that
we will differ. We do not seek the uniformity
possible only under totalitarianism.
It is all-important to our security, however, that
these differences be resolved in amity. We have
made that a primary objective in our relations
with our friends and allies of the free world.
Mr. Molotov and E00
One of Mr. Molotov’s chief targets in Berlin was
the European Defense Community, Enc. He took
pot-shots wherever he could at N ATO, but Enc, not
yet functioning, came in for the major share of
is attention.
We, of course, are very concerned over EDc. As
Secretary Dulles said recently:
Until the goals of E00 are achieved, NATO, and indeed
future peace, are in Jeopardy.
As Naro’s former head and new President of
the United States, General Eisenhower has made
it clear that there can be no long-term assurance
of security and vitality for Europe, and therefore
the Western World includin the United States,
unless the disunity between rance and Germany
is ended for all times.
Actually, of course, Eno is a Euro ean idea. It
was suggested originally, in fact, by rance. It is
not new. European thinkers have proposed it, in
some form or another, for centuries. Dante’s
De Monarchia is one such lan that comes to mind.
\Ve of the United States ave always favored it.
IVilliam Penn developed the idea in his Essay
Toward the Present and Future Peace of Euro e.
\Vashington is quoted as saying, “Some ay
Europe will . . . form a United States of Europe.”
Certainly, the Europeans in the last decade
have one a long way toward reaching unity. We
feel tlziat Enc is the next step. The majority of
their leaders agree with us.
But we cannot impose EDC on Europe. It must
come through their own volition. We can hope.
lVe can encourage. But we can do very little else.
Mr. Molotov, to be sure, has a plan of unity for
Europe: unity under the Soviets with the United
States nicely isolated in its own hemisphere until
they get around to taking care of us.
I have spoken of Europe. Neither the Soviet
nor the U.S.A. is forgetting, however, the vast
areas lying outside the Atlantic Community.
