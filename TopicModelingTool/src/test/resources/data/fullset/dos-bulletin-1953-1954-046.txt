considered fair and reasonable compensation for
the vast quantities of civilian-ty lend-lease arti-
cles remaining in Soviet custo y at the end of
hostilities, but that in the interest of achieving a
settlement, the Government of the United States
was willing to reduce further this amount pro-
vided that a truly constructive oﬂ'er were made
by the Soviet side. It was again emphasized that
the United States considered the Soviet oﬂ'er of
$300 million to be far from fair and reasonable
compensation for the residual lend-lease articles
and it was ointed out furthermore, that the Gov-
ernment 0 the United States had to take into
account the fact that by not returning the 186
naval craft and other vessels requested, the Soviet
Government was in clear default of the very agree-
ment under which negotiations have been carried
on since April 1947. The note of the Acting Secre-
tary of State afﬁrmed that it is therefore the
position of the Government of the United States
that when the Soviet Government has made ar-
rangements to fulﬁll its obligations under Article
V of the Lend-Lease Agreement of June 11, 1942,
the Government of the United States in the inter-
est of a settlement, will be prepared to make fur-
ther proposals concernin a ﬁnancial settlement.
On March 20, 1953 a urther note was sent to
the Embassy of the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics inquiring when a reply to the note of
November 5, 1952 might be expected. No replies
to either of these notes have been received by the
Government of the United States.
As His Excellen is aware, more than six years
have elapsed since t e beginning on A ril 30, 1947
of the negotiations for a settlement 0 the obliga-
tions of the Soviet Government under the Lend-
Lease Agreement of June 11, 1942. Accordingly,
the Government of the United States requests that
it be advised at an early date of the intentions of
the Soviet Government with respect to the return
of United States-owned lend-lease vessels as re-
quired under Article V of the Agreement of June
11,1942.

SOVIET NOTE OF OCTOBER 20
[Translation]
In connection with the aide-memoirs of the De-
partment of State dated September 11 of this
year, referring to the note of the Government of
the USA dated November 5, 1952 on the subject
of settling lend-lease accounts, I have the honor
to communicate the following, under instructions
from the Government of the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics.
The Soviet Government has been steadfastly
striving for a very prompt settlement of the lend-
lease accounts. In this connection it sufﬁces to
point out that the Soviet Government has returned
to the United States 3 icebreakers, 27 frigates, 7
tankers, and 1 dr -cargo vessel, and has agreed
to return 186 nava vessels. Agreements concern-
ing com ensation for the use in the USSR of
patents or oil-reﬁning rocesses have been con-
cluded with all ﬁrms w ich manifested a desire
to negotiate on mutually acceptable terms. The
Government of the USSR has repeatedly raised
the total amount of compensation for the remainder
of the lend-lease goods and has brought it u to
$300,000,000, while the Government of the SA,
on its part, has not designated a new reduced
total amount of compensation.
From the foregoing it follows that the Soviet
side has in the course of the negotiations made
substantial concessions and has introduced a num-
ber of constructive proposals directed toward the
achievement of an agreement for settling the lend-
lease accounts. The Soviet Government expects
that the Government of the USA will make the
necessary efforts for the achievement of an agree-
ment on questions that are still undecided, es-
pecially on the question of the total amount of
com nsation for the remainder of the lend-lease
goo s, and that it will adopt measures for the ful-
ﬁllment of the agreement previously concluded on
the question of merchant and naval vessels. The
Government of the USSR, on its part, is also
prepared henceforth to coo erate for purposes of
a swift and deﬁnitive sett ement of all matters
relating to the lend-lease accounts. The resump-
tion of direct negotiations by representatives of
the two parties mi ht serve as a practical step
which might contri ute to a more rapid achieve-
ment of an agreement.
Technical questions connected with the transfer
of the said 186 naval vessels may likewise be con-
sidered in these negotiations.
Accept, Excellency, the assurances of my high-
est consideration.
