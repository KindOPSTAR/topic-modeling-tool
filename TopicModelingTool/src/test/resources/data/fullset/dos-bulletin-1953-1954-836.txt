As great as is our desire to contribute effectively to the
establishment of strong and self-reliant economies else-
where in this hemisphere, the primary responsibility in
that ﬁeld lies upon the nations involved. It is primarily
through their foresight, industry, and self-discipline that
this goal will be achieved.‘
I who have lived for the better plart of 50 years
in the hos itable lands to the sout of us have no
doubt of t ieir ability to achieve that goal.
U.S. Asks Approval for
Construction of Libby Dam
DEPARTMENT ANNOUNCEMENT
Press release 287 dated May 27
On May 22, 1954, Secretary Dulles signed a new
application to the International Joint Commis-
swn for an order ap )roving the construction and
o eration of a mu tiple purpose dam on the
ootenai River about 15 miles upstream from
Libby, Mont.
A previous application, submitted to the Com-
mission on January 12, 1951,“ was withdrawn on
April 8, 1953,6 when local problems develo ed re-
arding the location of roads, railroads, an other
acilities. A new site about 4 miles upstream
from the ori 'nal location has now been selected
as it will re uce the magnitude of the problems
involved.
The new project will store 5,985,000 acre-feet
of water, a proximately 1 million acre-feet of
which woul be in Canada. The estimated cost
of the project is $263,300,000. Construction of
the dam b the Army engineers was authorized by
Congress in 1950, and lanning funds of $520,500
have been appropriated) for 1954.
The reservoir would extend 53 miles upstream
in the United States to the boundary and 42 miles
into Canada and would be one-half to one and one-
half miles wide. It would occupy approximately
47,800 acres of which 30,200 are in the United
States and 1 ,600 are in Canada.
The dam would be a concrete gravity structure
rising 410 feet above bed rock and about 2,700
feet ong at the crest of the dam. It would pro-
duce initially 600,000 kilowatts with an ultimate
installation of 800,000 kilowatts. It would make
possible the generation of ap roximatel 90,000
ii‘dditional kilowatts in Cana a on the ootenai
iver.

Hearings on this application were held by the (‘ommission
and the possibility of proceeding with that project re-
ceived very careful consideration by the Commission. On
account of domestic questions which arose the applica-

nels without being intermingled with the international
aspects of the problem.
3. Under the Flood Control Act of 1950 (Public Law

a project designated as "Libby Dam, Kootenai River,
Montana" was “adopted and authorized to be prose-
cuted under the direction of the Secretary of the Army
and the supervision of the Chief of Engineers.” Attached

the Secretary of State with a letter dated May 5, 1954

national Joint Commission." The Secretary of the Army
has requested the Department of State to present it with
this application to your Commission.
4. Particular attention is invited to the following im-
portant aspects of this Libby Dam Project:
a. The Committee on Commerce of the United States
Senate on September 24, 1943 adopted a resolution which

Document Numbered 308, Sixty-ninth Congress, ﬁrst
session, as authorized by the River and Harbor Act of
January 21, 1927, with a view to determining whether
any modiﬁcation of existing projects or recommended
comprehensive plans of improvement should be made at
this time."

proposed that the cooperation of the Government of
Canada in comprehensive studies of the Columbia River
Basin be obtained through a reference to the International
