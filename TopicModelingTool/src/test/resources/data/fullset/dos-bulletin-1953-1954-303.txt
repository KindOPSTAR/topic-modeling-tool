of in terms of the population of the Western Zone,
ghich is, of course, many times that of the Eastern
one.
The situation in Germany is thus comparable to
the situation which existed in Korea prior to 1947.
Up to that time the United States had its own
armed forces in South Korea; and there was eace.
The United States took its troops out of outh
Korea in 1949, and in 1950 there was war.
It is not necessary at this point to indulge in
argument as to just where the responsibilitgY for
that war lay. l\o one can dispute the two acts:
First, that the United States troo s were taken
out; and, immediately following t at, there was
war.
Therefore, I am sure that Mr. Molotov will
understand, even if he does not agree with our
state of mind, when we say that we are highly
skeptical of a proposal put forward in the name
of peace which involves our following the same
course of action which, under remar ably sim-
ilar circumstances, in fact lead to war.
Dangers of Dlsunlted Germany
It is to ﬂy in the face of the teachings of history,
and indeed of elemental reasoning to seek peace
by continuing the disunity of a people who are
bound together by sentiments of patriotism and
by ethnic unity. _
The way to get peace and promote peace in
Europe is not Simply to think of various deVices
whereby we can miti te the dangers of a dis-
united Germany. 0 should seek a united
Germany.
That is why I regret that in this topic of item
2 the Soviet Union has gotten lost in its great
andiose scheme, piling words n n words, and
it has left the central problem, which is the peace-
ful uniﬁcation of Germany.
It is not an accident that the three Western
Ministers, under this item 2, have concentrated
their attention on the problem of Germany and
the creation of a united Germany through free
elections. It is because we believe that this goes
to the heart of the problem of security for
Europe.
We are also convinced that a united Germany
should be allowed to develop along peaceful lines
of its own choosing. A Germany which is co-
erced, which is told what it cannot do, is a Ger-
many which almost surely will follow the same
course that was followed b the Germany which
succeeded the Treaty of Versailles. There the
restrictions which were imposed were the very
thing that enabled the extreme nationalists to
come to power.
Therefore, our second oint is that Germany
must be allowed to pursue er inclinations so long
as these are peaceful and compatible with the
security of the rest of us. Since, in fact, Ger-
many wishes to associate herself with the Western
countries of Europe, it is essential to peace that
she be allowed to do so. If she had wished to
associate herself with the powers of Eastern
Europe, we would not have wanted to force her
otherwise. The main point is that we should
not attempt to apply such a coercion to Germans
that they will not feel that Germany is an inde-
pendent sovereign state. In that way, I repeat,
ies great danger.
It is a fact, which all of us who really want
peace should eagerly welcome, that certainly the
greater part of the Germans want to adopt a
course w iich will end, for at least 50 years, and
I believe for all time, a distinctively national
army, and equally end the German general staff.
The fact that the Germans want to do this gives
us a unique opportunity to go to meet them, and
to consolidate that present will. That will may
not alwa s be with us. If today we reject that
will of t e German people which goes in the di-
rection of eace, if we tr to substitute provisions
which wil be forcibly imposed upon Germany,
if we perpetuate the division of Germany, if we
impose limitation and controls of the nature of
the Versailles Treaty, then, I say we would be
accepting a heavy responsibility before history.
STATEMENT OF FEBRUARY 18
Press release 88 dated February 19
As I s eak for the last time at this Conference,
I cannot at record a large measure of regret. \Ve
have failed to satisfy the hopes which many
throughout the world placed in us. I refer par-
ticularly to the peoples of East and West Germany
and of Austria.
It seems to me that our failures are not how-
ever due to lack of effort, or to inadequacies of
detail. Our failures are of a kind which could
not have been avoided by mere di loniatic or
negotiating skills at this conference. e encoun-
tered a fundamental difference between the views
of the East and the West.
This is not the time or the place to discuss
philosophies or creeds. It is, however, important
to observe that all of our basic differences here
have revolved around the question of whether it
was right, or indeed safe, to give man and nations
a genuine freedom of choice.
he Western Powers were willing to lace trust
in the German and Austrian peoples. The Soviet
Union was not. Its dele tion pointed out that.
the Germans, if given free om, might again follow
such warlike leadership as was presented by the
Kaiser and by Hitler; and that the Austrians, if
left alone, might not abide by their solemn en-
gagement to maintain their independence and to
avoid absorption by Germany.
The Western Powers realize that no one can
know with certainty the use to which men and na-
tions will put their freedom. History records
