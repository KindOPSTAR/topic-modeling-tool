funds. It will also propose that the Secretary of
Defense have primary responsibility for the ad-
ministration of foreign military assistance in
accordance with the policy guidance provided by
the Secretary of State.
The fact that we can now reduce our foreign
economic assistance in many areas is gratifying
evidence that its objectives are being achieved.
By continuing to surpass her prewar levels of eco-
nomic activity. Western Europe gains self-reli-
ance. Thus our relationship enters a new phase
which can bring results beneﬁcial to our taxpayers
and our allies alike, if still another step is taken.
This step is the creation of a healthier and freer
system of trade and payments within the free
world—a system in which our allies can earn their
own way and our economy can continue to ﬂourish.
The free world can no longer afford the kinds of
arbitrary restraints on trade that have continued
ever since the war.
On this problem I shall submit to the Congress
detailed recommendations, after our joint Com-
mission on Foreign Economic Policy has made its
report.
Atomlc Energy Proposal
As we maintain our military strength during the
coming year and draw closer the bonds with our
allies, we shall be in an improved position to dis-
cuss outstanding issues with the Soviet Union.
Indeed we shall be glad to do so whenever there is
a reasonable prospect of constructive results.
In this spirit the atomic energy proposals of the
United States were recently presented to the
United Nations General Assembly.2 A truly con-
structive Soviet reaction will make possible a new
start toward an era of peace and away from the
fatal road toward atomic war.
Defense
Since our hope for all the world is peace, we owe
ourselves and the world a candid explanation of
the military measures we are taking to make that
peace secure.
As we enter this new year, our military power
continues to grow. This power is for our own
defense and to deter aggression. We shall not be
aggressors, but we and our allies have and will
maintain a massive capability to strike back.
’ Brnurmw of Dec. 21,1953, p. 847.
Here are some of the considerations in our de-
fense planning:
First, while determined to use atomic power to
serve the usages of peace, we take into full account
our great and growing number of nuclear weapons
and the most effective means of using them against
an aggressor if they are needed to preserve our
freedom.
Our defense, therefore, will be stronger if,
under appropriate security safeguards, we share
with our allies certain knowledge of the tactical
use of our nuclear weapons. I urge the Congress
to provide the needed authority.
Second, the usefulness of these new weapons
creates new relationships between men and mate-
rials. These new relationships permit economies
in the use of men as we build forces suited to our
situation in the world today. As will be seen
from the budget message on January 21, the air
power of our Navy and Air Force is receiving
heavy emphasis.
Third. our armed forces must regain mobility
of action. Our strategic reserves must be cen-
trally placed and readily deployable to meet sud-
den aggression against ourselves and our allies.
Fourth, our defense must rest on trained man-
power and its most economical and mobile use.
A professional corps is the heart of any security
organization. It is necessarily the teacher and
leader of those who serve temporarily in the dis-
charge of the obligation to help defend the Re-
public. Pay alone will not retain in the career
service of our armed forces the necessary numbers
of long-term and able personnel. I strongly urge,
therefore, a more generous use of traditional bene-
ﬁts important to service morale. Among these are
adequate living quarters and family housing units,
and medical care for dependents.
Studies of military manpower have just been
completed by the National Security Training
Commission and a committee appointed by the
Director of the Ofﬁce of Defense Mobilization.
Evident weaknesses exist in the state of readiness
and organization of our reserve forces. Measures
to correct these weaknesses will be later submitted
to the Congress.
Fifth, the ability to convert swiftly from par-
tial to all-out mobilization is imperative to our
security. For the ﬁrst time. mobilization oﬁicials
know what are the requirements for 1,000 major
items needed for military uses.
These data, now being related to civilian re-
