Power,” was on the Mercator projection, but with-
out parallels and meridians, and limited by an
ellipse. lVeigert, analyzin Mackinder’s rea -
raisal in his paper on “The ftound \Vorld and t e
%'inning of the Peace,”1 remarks “. . . from
Mercator he turns to the globe,” but he also
ointed out that “The great circle which Mac-
'nder describes does not in fact cut the coast of
France but passes to the north of Greenland.
Thus he showed himself to be an unwitting pris-
oner of Mercator.” 2
One of the best oorrectives of geographical mis-
conce tions, in my opinion, is the article entitled
“The yth of the Continents” by Eugene Stale ,
an economist, in Forei n Aﬁairs in 1941. I-lb
points out that so-calle “continental solidarity”
is largely a ﬁgure of speech and that the oceans
tend to unify more than the continents.8
We need to realize that most world maps con-
stitute merely a conventional device for portray-
ing eographical distributions as they are found
at different latitudes and longitudes. There is no
magic means of transferring to a globe the con-
cepts conveyed by maps. The most effective
means I know of for visualizing the peculiar prop-
erties of various map rojections is to substitute
a human head for the geo raphical lobe as
seen in the photographs in gure 3. The eyes
are on the uator; the center of the nose is on
the Greenwic meridian; the circular cap is much
easier to copy than hair. This human head has
been transferred to a number of the most widely
used map projections, as if the eyes, nose, mouth,
ears, chin, and cap were land masses. Here are
shown (ﬁgure 4) the results of mapping the world
on familiar projections. Such “ma s’ are, in a
sense, caricatures of the human hea represented
and could scarcely serve to identify the contest-
ants in a beauty contest or to record the faces in
a rogues’ gallery.
Maps centered at the North Pole are sometimes
presented as if they were a new idea that readin
corrects the misconceptions derived from Mer-
cator and other maps. Actually such maps have
been made for several centuries. To visualize
some polar geography, we have here a map of
that part of the northern hemisphere north of 30°
north latitude, drawn on a gnomonic or great
circle projection, centered at the North Pole
(ﬁgure 5). Every straight line on any gnomonic
projection describes a great circle course. Con-
sider the advantages of commercial aviation at
Thule, Greenland, if and when it becomes possible.
Nothing would better illustrate the new rela-
tions of the United States. I spent the last 4
days of April 1953 at the great Thule Air Force

Figure 3. Human head on a geographical globe
Thin head of a man was drawn upon a geographical
globe by the artist, Boris Artngasheﬂ. The nose is cen-
tered on the Greenwich meridian, and the eyes are on the
equator. This was made to facilitate graphic studies of
the properties of world maps on various map projections.
Base, near 76°30’ north latitude, 69° west lon i-
tude. Located within 810 nautical miles of t 0
North Pole, about 2,250 nautical miles from Wash-
ington, and 2,400 nautical miles from Moscow,
Thule is open to supply by steamships for about
70 days each summer—when all poss1ble supplies
for the year are transported and stored. Since it
lies 10° north of the Arctic Circle and therefore
much farther north than North Cape, Norway, or
Point Barrow, Alaska, commercial air passengers
could stop off at Thule between ﬂights and enjo
the “midnight sun”—continuously above the hOI‘l-
zon during about 4 months (April 23 to August
21) ; for only about 98 days (November 4 to Febru-
ary 11) is the sun continuously below the horizon.
Air routes between many northern hemisphere
cities will eventually be established that will
traverse at least short stretches of the Arctic Sea.
Thule will be found near the great circle routes
connecting northern and eastern Euro e with cen-
tral and western North America—w ich should
carry heavy air traﬁic.
