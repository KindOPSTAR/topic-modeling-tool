stitution of 1946. They ma acquire French
nationality under certain con itions.
The question of the relationship between the
Cameroons and the French Union has been con-
stantly under review by the Council. Certain in-
digenous organizations have opposed what they
considered an assimilation of the territory to
French Overseas Territories as ham ering its de-
velopment and removing any hope or independ-
ence. The administering authority, however has
repeatedly stated that the territory enjoyed a legal
status very different from that of neighboring
French territories and that the eoples of the
Cameroons would, upon the termination of the
trusteeship s stem, be free to achieve independence
outside the rench Union if they so desired. The
Council expressed “conﬁdence” that the territory’s
relationship with the French Union will continue
to remain in accordance with the terms of the
trusteeship agreement and the provisions of the
charter.
Underlining the need for a eater sense of
“national consciousness” among t ie indigenous in-
habitants, the Council urged the administering
authority to introduce the single electoral college
system and to increase the African membership
of the Territorial Assembly. In this connection
the Council noted that a bill which would extend
this Assembly’s powers was endin before the
French Parliament and urge the a inistering
authority to have the bill enacted with the least
possible delay. The Council also expressed satis-
action over various regional administrative re-
forms and endorsed further measures to democ-
ratize the traditional tribal institutions.
Conditions In East Atrlca
. When the Trusteeship Council turns its atten-
tion from the trust territories of West Africa to
those of East Africa, it takes a leap, as the French
representative said, not only in space but also in
time. Here conditions are vastly diﬂ'erent. For
one thing, their contact with Western civilization
has been much more recent and as a result native
political development is much less advanced. In
both Ruanda-Urundi and Tanganyika the present
emphasis is upon the improvement of local govern-
ment, and attempts are being made by the two
Trust Powers, Belgium and the United Kingdom,
to, establish more representative local regional
councils based upon tribal institutions and with
increasing authority in such matters as commu-
nications, markets, health services, and ﬁscal
powers. Very little African participation in the
central governments yet exists. And in both ter-
ritories, central government responsibility remains
almost entirely in the hands of the European gov-
ernors and their advisory councils. In these ad-
visory councils Africans are still in a minority,
but the Council was informed that both adminis-
trations hope progressively to increase the amount
of African participation.
An additional problem, particularly in Tan-
ganyika, results from the comparatively small but
very active European and Asian communities.
In that country there are about 8 million Africans,
18,000 Europeans, and 80,000 Asians, the latter
mostly of Indian and Pakistani origin. These
non-African communities naturally press for rep-
resentation in the government, and, smce their on -
tural and economic position is much more ad-
vanced, their re resentation tends to be out of
proportion to t eir numbers. This situation,
quite understandably, is one of the causes of inter-
racial friction. A major problem confronting the
administration is to harmonize the various racial
and language groups into a single nation and to
build up a common attern of existence as Tan-
ganyika citizens rat er than as three disparate
groups—Europeans, Asians, and Africans.
In its general conclusions, the Council noted
with satisfaction the harmony in the relationships
among these three main population groups.
However, it pointed to the possible dangers in-
herent in the lack of balance in their stages of
development. It invited the administering au-
thority to include in its future reports statistical
data indicating the number of male adults in aid
employment and their ratio to the total emp o -
able male opulation. It recommended that t e
administering authority take all ossible measures
further to develo use of the wahili language,
already extensive employed in the territory.
In general, the Council recalled the desirability
of establishing a common status of citizens of
Tanganyika and of subordinating communal
interests to those of the territory as a whole.
The Council expressed the hope that the reten-
tion of separate representation of the three popu-
lation groups on the Le 'slative Council, even
on an improved basis 0 parity among them,
would be regarded as a transitional measure and
that the administering authority would consider
instituting as soon as possible a common electoral
roll. It also expresse the hope that the African
membership of the Executive Council would be
increased.
Problems Referred by General Assembly
In addition to its examination of conditions in
the six African trust territories, the Council also
considered several resolutions of a general char-
acter which were referred to it by the General
Assembly.
The ma'ority of the members of the General
Assembly ave for several years complained that
the administerin authorities were not plannin
deﬁnitely enoug for the attainment of sel -
government or independence of the respective ter-
ritories under their charge. Accordingly, a
resolution was adopted asking the Trusteeship
