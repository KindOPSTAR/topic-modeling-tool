Since Japan must import most of its raw ma-
terials and about one-fourth of its food, it will
have to have access to world markets and be able
to compete for them on equal terms. This is not
the case at present, and thus Japan’s imports
dangerously outweigh its exports.
In 1952 the adverse trade balance reached $759
million. Japan’s trade deﬁcit in 1953 is estimated
to be $1,135 million, larger by far than any pre-
vious year. This is a grave situation, which has
been sustained thus far onl by our special ex-
penditures in connection wit the Korean hostili-
ties and the stationing of our forces in Japan,
which, of course, are no permanent solution to
Ja an’s problem.
apan's trade with the United States is also
sharply out of balance—the deﬁcit in 1952 was
$539 million. Almost one-third of all Japanese
imports came from the United States, and we
bought about one-sixth of Japan’s total exports.
In 1952 Japan was our largest customer for cotton,
rice, barley, and soybeans and our second most
important buyer of wheat.
Reductlon of Tarlll Barrlers
We have a self-evident stake in preserving and
expanding the market for U.S. goods in Japan.
Equally important to recognize is the necessity for
J a an to sell in the American market. It is the
on y way Japan can earn dollars to continue to buy
in the United States so long as most currencies of
the world are inconvertible. I recognize that
there are many serious problems involved in this
question, but the fact remains that we must buy
more Japanese goods in this country—and that
means lower tariffs.
There are several recommendations in the recent
report of the Randall Commission which, if im-
glemented, can be of beneﬁt not only to the United
tatcs but to the Ja anese economy as well. The
recommendations w ich call for further sim liﬁ-
cation of customs procedures and for authorizing
the President to reduce tariﬂ' barriers would im-
pzove the Japanese export outlook signiﬁcantly.
gislation permitting the United States to take
the lead in reducing world trade barriers would
probably enable Japan to negotiate fully with the
contracting parties to the General Agreement on
Tariﬁs and Trade, with a view to becoming a
full-ﬂedged contractin part to the agreement.
Tariﬂ’ negotiations wit the nited States would
result in an increased volume of U.S.-Japanese
trade, which would be extremely advantageous to
both nations.
Recommendations of the Randall Commission
of importance in our economic relations with
Japan are those which call for a vigorously
pressed program of technical assistance and the
creation abroad of a climate conducive to private
foreign investment. The Commission also su -
gests U.S. Government loans where economic aid
is needed and cannot be provided by private or
international sources. These recommendations
would be particularly important in increasing the
purchasing__power_ of Southeast Asia, an area in
which. expanded trade regulations with Japan
would be immensely beneﬁcial to all parties
concerned.
I should like to make it clear that we are not
favorin Japanese tradin interests at the ex-
pense 0 those of U.S. and uropean businessmen
trading in Southeast Asia or to the detriment of
the countries of that area. An increase in J apan’s
trade with Southeast Asia would not be a ift
benevolently bestowed but a reward that the ap-
anese businessmen would have to earn on a basns
of effort and merit.
Japanese competition in the Southeast Asian
market will undoubtedly create new problems in
some places, but I am convinced that the market
is large enough for all comers. With nearly a
billion peo le in the area whose needs cannot pos-
sibl be ﬁl ed in the immediate future, the inﬂux
of apanese trade would work to the advantage
of everyone concerned.
This review of Japan’s progress since it re-
gained sovereignty is by no means complete, as
you are well aware. But I think it sketches in
some general lines that show how far Japan has
progressed in that period and what must be
achieved in the future. A cautious optimism
about the future of Japan is justiﬁed, but we
should recognize the many pitfalls to be avoided
and the numerous obstacles to be overcome before
the danger zone is passed throu h.
lVe are all familiar with the 0] expression that
“the ﬁrst hundred years are the hardest.” The
ﬁrst hundred years of formal relations between
the United States and Japan come to an end on
March 31, the 100th anniversary of the Treat
of Kanagawa. Let as indeed ho that the har -
est ears are behind us and go orward together
in t e conﬁdence that our friendly relations are
heralding the advent of a century of friendly co-
operation, of peace and prosperity.
