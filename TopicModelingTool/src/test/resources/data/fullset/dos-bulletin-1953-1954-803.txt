LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL
To the Congress of the United States:
I have the honor to submit herewith the fourth
semiannual report on operations under the Mutual
Defense Assistance Control Act of 1951 (Battle
Act), the administration of which is a part of my
responsibilities.
The period covered is July through December
1953.
A large art of this report is an examination of
what the oviet Union has been doin in its trade
relations with the free world. In or er to put the
Russian activities of the last half of 1953 in a more
understandable framework we have ranged back
over the last 30 years to show how foreign trade
ﬁts into their economy and serves their purposes.
To study Soviet trends and tactics is obviously
important to the economic defense of the free
world. To make a report to the Congress and the
ublic on these matters should also be useful.
ere has been much public interest in the subject.
The selection of this theme, however, does not
mean that Soviet trade activities are the only im-
portant consideration to be taken into account in
the formulation of U.S. economic defense polic .
They are not. Many other factors enter in, as to d
in Chapter V.
In preparin the report my staff has drawn
heavily u on t e expert knowledge of the Depart-
ment of tate and other agencies. But of course
the responsibility for the report is ours.
In my last Battle Act report I said that the
strat 'c trade control rogram had been ham-
pered y lack of public nowledge. This is still
true, but to a less extent, it seems to me. There is
a better understanding of the Government’s poli-
cies, a greater realization that the soundness of
East-West trade policy is to be judged not ri-
marily on the amount of trade, but more on w at
kind of goods move back and forth, and on what
terms they move.

Director, Foreign Operations Administration.

INTRODUCTION
Note on “Strategic” and “Nonstrateglc”
To help rotect the security of the free world,
the United tates and certain other countries have
been working together for more than 4 years to
withhold strategic goods from the Soviet bloc.
But how can you tell strategic goods from non-
strategic goods A good many people have asked
that question. It is a reasonab e question and it
deserves a nontechnical answer.
The answer is that strategic goods, as under-
stood in the da -to-dayl operations of the pro am,
are those goo s whic would make a signi cant
contribution to the warmaking power of the Soviet
bloc.
This is a practical guide to action. There is
no rigid deﬁnition that holds good for all times,
