The U.S. Government and the High Authority
of the European Coal and Steel Community have
been holding preliminary talks durin the past
months concerning a loan by‘ the Unite States to

ernment or one of its agencies would foster Euro-
pean integration in a tangible and useful way.1

.Iolnt Communique by
Turkey and Pakistan
Press release 81 dated February 18
The U. S. Government warmly welcomes the
announced intention of the Governments of Tur-
key and Pakistan “to study methods of achieving
closer friendl collaboration in the political, eco-
nomic, and c tural spheres as well as of strength-
