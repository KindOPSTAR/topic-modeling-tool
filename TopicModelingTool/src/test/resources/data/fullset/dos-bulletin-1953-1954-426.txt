terested, however, in making it crystal clear
exactly what such aid would entail.
In the meantime, the Governments of Turkey
and Pakistan carried on informal talks which re-
sulted in the Februa 19 announcement. As I
have said, the Unite States warmly welcomed
this development. It seemed to us that this step
would rovide increased assurance that these two
countries and others in the area would be better
able to keep their independence. Moreover, it was
evidence t at the need for collective security in
the Middle East was being realized by the states
of the area themselves, as Mr. Dulles had said it
must be.
The Foreign Minister of Turkey explained the
nature of the pro osed agreement. He said : “The
treat to be conc uded will not be an alliance or
a mi itary pact, but it will nevertheless envisage
a. common effort with a view to seeking and deter-
mining what may be done to strengthen peace and
security, bearing in mind geo-political considera-
tions, the possibilities of the two states, and what
is feasible internationally.” He went on to say
that “the treaty in question will be open to inter-
ested peaceful states” and “that it will not and
callilnpt be directed against any country of good

Mllltery Aid for Pekleten
The decision of the United States to grant mili-
tary aid to Pakistan was taken in the context of
the announcement by Turkey and Pakistan and
of Pakistan’s formal request to us for aid.
In making its request known, the Government
of Pakistan stated that it was asking the United
States for this help “for the purpose of achievi
increased defensive strength and a higher ails
stronger degree of economic stability designed to
foster international peace and security wit in the
framework of the United Nations Charter.” The
statement went on to say that Pakistan was in
agreement with the requirements of the mutual
security legislation, under which the United States
makes such grants available. This legislation
strictly deﬁnes the end uses of grant military aid.
It says, for instance, that the nation receiving aid
shall agree that “the equipment, materials, or serv-
ices provided will be used solely to maintain its
internal security, its legitimate self-defense, or to
permit it to articipate in the defense of the area,
or in Unite Nations collective security arran
ments and measures.” The act further provi es
that the recipient nation agrees that it will not
undertake any act of aggression against any other
nation.
On February 25, President Eisenhower an-
nounced1 that he was glad to comply with Paki-
stan’s request. He said that the United States
has “been gravely concerned over the weakness of
defensive capabilities in the Middle East” and that
' Ibid., Mar. 15, 1954, p. 401.

“regional groupings to ensure security against
aggression constitute the most effective means to
assure survival and progress.” Thus, within the
framework of the pro osed agreement between
Turkey and Pakistan, e decided to grant Paki-
stan military assistance.
Referring to the terms of the mutual security
legislation the President said: “These undertak-
ings aﬂ'ord adequate assurance to all nations re-
gardless of their political orientation and what-
ever their international policies may be, that the
arms the United States provides for the defense
of the free world will in no way threaten their own
securit .” “I can say,” the President continued,
“that if our aid to an country, including Paki-
stan, is misused and irected against another in
aggression I will undertake immediately, in ac-
cordance with my constitutional authority, a ro-
priate action both within and without the U. . to
thwart such aggression. I would also consult
with the Congress on further steps.”
At the same time, the President made ublic
the text of a personal letter he had sent to rime
Minister Nehru. In this letter he stated that the
decision to give Pakistan aid “does not in any way
affect the friendshi we feel for India.” He con-
tinued, “Our two overnments have a eed that
our desires for peace are in accord. t has also
been understood that if our interpretation of exist-
ing circumstances and our belief in how to achieve
our goals diﬂer, it is the right and duty of sover-
eign nations to make their own decisions.”
He went on to cite the economic and technical
assistance which the United States has provided
India and the fact that he is recommendin to the
Congress that such help he continued. e con-
cluded by notin that it is in the interest of the
free world that ndia have a strong military estab-
lishment and that “If your Government should
conclude that circumstances require military aid
of a. type contemplated by our mutual security
legislation, please be assured that your re-
quest would receive my most sympathetic con-
sideration.”
I should like to underline and paraphrase what
the President said:
First, our Government is convinced that Paki-
stan desires our assistance and is seeking closer
collaboration with Turke solely to defend her-
self against aggression rom outside the area.
We do not believe that Pakistan has aggressive in-
tentions toward any of her neighbors nor that she
will adopt an intransigent attitude in the settle-
ment of existing disputes.
Second, if contrary to our belief Pakistan were
to develop an aggressive attitude, all the weight
at our disposal would be thrown into the balance
against such a development.
Third, we continue to desire the most friendly
relations with India and to consider her independ-
ence and well-being as of the greatest importance
to the whole world.
