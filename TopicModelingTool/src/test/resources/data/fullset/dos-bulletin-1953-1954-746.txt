At present, I will merely say that, after his state-
ment, it is extremely diiiicult to believe that the
Viet Minh representative has come to this Con-
ference with any intention of negotiating a just
and durable peace.
The United States has come here with sincere
ho es that the work of this Conference at Geneva
wi 1 result in the restoration of peace in Indochina
and in the opportunity for Cambodia, Laos, and
Viet-Nam to en'oy their independence under con-
ditions of a real and lasting peace.
The United States has watched with sympathy
the development of the peoples of Indochina to-
ward independence. The United States and many
other countries have recognized the three States of
Cambodia, Laos, and Viet-Nam. We have fol-
lowed with great interest the negotiations which
have been undertaken by France and the Asso-
ciated States to perfect the independence of the
Associated States.
The United States has shown in many ways its
sympathy for the effort of the Associated States
to safeguard their inde endence. We have pro-
vided material aid to rance and the Associated
States to assist them in this effort and have given
them support to enable them to resist open and
covert invasion from without their borders. We
will continue to do so, for the simple reason that
it is the wish of the American peo 1e to assist any
nation that is determined to defens its liberty and
independence.
The United States maintains that the ﬁrst rin-
ciple of any settlement in Indochina must to
assure the inde endence and freedom of the States
of Cambodia, aos, and Viet-Nam.
The United States also maintains that any settle-
ment in Indochina must give assurance of real and
lasting peace. To this end, the United States be-
lieves that any settlement must be preceded by an
armistice agreement which incorporates effective
and adequate safeguards.
The United States maintains that such an armis-
tice agreement can be effective only under interna-
tional supervision. The United States, therefore,
believes that any settlement must include provi-
sions for effective international supervision and
assurance of powers and privileges on the part
of the international supervising authority equal to
enable it to carry out its various responsibilities.
The United States welcomes the French initia-
tive and believes the French representative has
made a helpful contribution toward the restora-
tion of peace in Indochina. The French pro-
posals are consistent with the general principles to
which any satisfactory settlement must conform.
In our opinion, they should be accompanied by a
program for the resolution of political problems.
We look forward to hearing the views of the
Government of Viet-Nam on such a program.
The United States notes the French proposal
that “agreements shall be guaranteed by the States
articipating in the Geneva Conference.” The
United States has already demonstrated its devo-
tion to the principle of collective security and its
willingness to help in the development of collective
security arrangements in Southeast Asia, as else-
where. Until it is possible to see more clearly the
exact nature of the agreements to be aranteed
and to determine the obligations of t e guaran-
tors, we will, of course, not be able to express any
judgment on this section of the proposal.
The U.S. delegation suggests that the Confer-
ence adopt the French proposal as a basis of dis-
cussion and hopes that we will move forward con-
structively and rapidly in bringing about a
restoration of peace in Indochina.
The U.S. delegation has listened with sympathy
to the factual recital of the representatives of
Cambodia and Laos and will study with interest
their proposals for the restoration of peace in
Cambodia and Laos.
