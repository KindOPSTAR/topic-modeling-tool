standard of living in the various countries through
teaching local technicians to carry on the work
in the various ﬁelds of activities. Contributions
of the local governments to the joint pro rams
average more than three times that of the nited
States.
Harold E. Stassen, Director of Foreign Op—
erations, and other key FOA oﬁicials directly con-
cerned with Latin American operations attended
the regional meeting. Similar conferences have
previously been held with the FDA country di-
rectors in Western Europe and the Near East. A
Far East meeting is planned for Manila in Feb-
ruary.
The on-the‘spot regional meetings have been
arranged by Foa as part of its program to decen-
tralize operations and dele ate authority to the
ﬁeld personnel. Through t ese meetings, Wash-
ington ofﬁcials are able to get ﬁrsthand re rts on
the progress of the programs and adwse ﬁeld
personnel of current operating policies.
U.S. Operations Missions to the following
countries were represented at the meeting: Bo-
livia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba,
Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Gua-
temala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua,
Parliama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Vene-
zue a.
Expansion of Cuban
Nickel Production
More nickel for American defense was assured
with an announcement on January 12 by the Gen-
eral Services Administration that it will go for-
ward with an expansion of the Government-owned
nickel plant at Nicaro, Cuba, and contribute
ﬁnancial assistance to promising research in new
nickel metallurgy.
The new program was announced by Edmund
F. Mansure, Administrator of General Services,
11 on notiﬁcation that the Ofﬁce of Defense
obilization had certiﬁed that the Nicaro ex-
pansion and nickel research are “essential to na-
tional defense.”
Mr. Mansure also announced that the ODM
certiﬁcation has made available $43 million to en-
large Nicaro’s capacity by 75 ercent and has ear-
marked $1 million as a researc fund.
“In its conception and design,” Mr. Mansure
stated, “the new program will lay a foundation for
extending the production of nickel for an indeﬁnite
period of time. In this important respect, it
differs from some earlier expansion programs
which contracted for the delivery of deﬁnite
quantities of nickel over varying terms of years.
“The size and scope, moreover, reﬂect the fact
that nickel remains a vital commodity in short
suplply. Therefore, we face the challenge of
bul ding our sources of production to the level at
which supplies will equal the combined military,
stockpile, and civilian requirements.”
Mr. Mansure pointed out that the program en-
visions the commercial utilization of the mineral
resources of eastern Cuba.
“This is a goal,” he went on, “in which the
United States and Cuba have been in full accord,
not only to develop a reliable source of vital de-
fense metals, but also to broaden and strengthen
the economic base in both countries.
“In rehabilitating and operating Nicaro, GSA
has had earnest, abiding cooperation in Cuba-—
by the National Government, by private industry,
and by labor. For this reason we are conﬁdent
that the Nicaro expansion will be advanced
smoothly and quickly to its rewarding goal.”
Now in operation, the Nicaro plant is currently
producing nickel at a rate approachin 28 million
pounds a year. The certiﬁed plan calls for an ex-
pansion of 7 5 percent in capacit . Preliminary
engineering studies have alread een undertaken
for the new structures and equipment which will
be required to carry the development from plan-
ning to production.
Built early in World War II, Nicaro was shut
down in 1947 and later transferred to the National
Industrial Reserve in GSA. Its rehabilitation was
undertaken in 1951. and the production was re-
newed in January 1952, a year later. Full opera-
tion was reache in July 1952 and has been sus-
tained ever since. The plant is o erated under
a management contract by the Nic el Processing
Corporation jointly owned by a Cuban corpora-
tion, Fomento de Minerales, and the American
ﬁrm National Lead Company.
Mr. Mansure pointed out that completion of
the expansion should make available at Nicaro
a highly desirable nickel-producing plant for
American industry.
“Full conversion of the Nicaro enterprise to
private management. private operation, and pri-
vate ownership continues to be a foremost goal
toward which we are advancing the project,”
Mr. Mansure added.
The research fund allotment recognizes that
world conditions, reﬂecting in part increased de-
mand for nickel and in part inroads on reserves
previously in use, have brought nickel metallurgy
to an experimental crossroads.
Various new processes, some with their variants,
are being advanced and tested in many parts of
the Western Hemisphere in an intensive search
for economical methods of exploiting ores which
have refused to respond to traditional nickel
metallurgy. In view of the likelihood that one or
more of the processes may unlock the development
of valuable, latent reserves in Brazil, Canada,
Cuba, United States, and Venezuela, GSA will em-
ploy the research funds to help carry forward
constructive experimentation.
