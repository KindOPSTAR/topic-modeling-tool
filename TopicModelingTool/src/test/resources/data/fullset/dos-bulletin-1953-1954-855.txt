Education and Freedom—Core of the American Dream
Address by the President‘
White House press release dated May 31
This occasion has for me particular signiﬁ-
cance because, for a time, I was intimately asso-
ciated with those whose lifework is the education
of America’s outh. I am very proud that,
through a briefy span in Columbia s 200-year his-
tory, my name was closely joined with that of this
great institution. For such expression of per-
sonal pride in an association with a home of
learning, I have illustrious predecessors.
Thomas Jefferson, for one, at the end of his
long life, preferred that posterity should think of
him, not as the holder of high office, but for his
relationship to the University of Virginia.
He held that the free ﬂow of information was
indispensable to the maintenance of liberty. He
wrote that if he had to make a choice between a
society without newspapers or newspapers with-
out a government, he would prefer the latter.
And, of the diffusion of knowled e among the
eople through schools, he said: “ 0 other sure
foundation can be devised for the preservation of
freedom and of happiness.”
A relentless foe of tyranny in every guise, Jef-
ferson throughout his life was steadfast to a fun-
damental tenet of Western society, proclaimed
2,00” years ago in the treasury of the Temple at
Jerusalem, that the truth will make men free.
The pursuit of truth, its preservation and wide
dissemination; the achievement of freedom, its
defense and propagation—these purposes are
woven into the American concept of education.
The American university—neither the property of
a favored class, nor an ivo tower where vision—
aries are sheltered from t e test of ractice—
every American university fundamentaily is ded-
icated to Columbia’s Bicentennial theme, “Man’s
right to knowledge and the free use thereof.”
Those who chose the theme of this Bicentennial
could not have found a more American one. I
say this with apology to scholars of all countries,

Bicentennial Dinner at New York City.
lest they think that I might be deliberately nar-
rowing a universal principle to a provincial appg:
cation. But from the very beginning of the
public, education of the eople, freedom for the
people—these interdepen ent purposes have been
the core of the American dream.
Far from bein fearful of ideas, the founders
of the Republic feared only misguided efforts to
suppress ideas. _
i 0 less profound was their faith in man’s ability
to use freedom, for the achievement of his own
and his country’s good. In the freedom of the
individual, they saw an energy that could hurdle
mountains, harness rivers, clear the wilderness,
transform a continent.
So convinced, they proclaimed to all the world
the revolutionary doctrine of the Divine Rights
of the Common Man. That doctrine has ever Since
been the heart of the American faith. Emphatic
rejection of this faith is the cardinal characteristic
of the materialistic despotisms of our time.
In consequence, the world, once divided by
oceans and mountain ranges, is now split by hostile
concepts of man’s character and nature. Physical
barriers and their effects have been largely sur-
mounted. But new barriers seem more insuper-
able than the old.
Two Opposlng Camps
Two world camps, whose geographic bound-
aries in important areas are mutually shared, lie
farther apart in motivation and conduct than the
poles in s ace. One is dedicated to the freedom
of the in ividual and to the right of all to live
in peace; the other, to the atheistic philosophy of
materialism and the effort to establish its sway
over all the earth. Watching the two opposing
camps are hundreds of millions still undecided in
active loyalty.
Today, there is no more important knowledge
for each of us to understand than the essential
characteristics of this struggle.
