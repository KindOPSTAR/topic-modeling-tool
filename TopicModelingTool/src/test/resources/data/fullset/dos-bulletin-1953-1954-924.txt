Japan’s population, now grown to 8'7 million,
depends for its livelihood upon foreign trade.
Trade is offered by the Communists—at a price.
The price is that J apan—the only industrial ower
in Asia—should cease to cooperate with the nited
Nations and with the United States as it is now
doing and should become a workshop where the
abundant raw materials of Asia can be converted
into implements for Communist use against the
free world. _J apan must trade to live, and if the
free nations fall to make it ossible for Ja an
to earn its way, then inevitalbly though re uc-
tantly, her peoplewcum turnelsewhare. This
would be stupid from an economic standpoint and
folly from a political standpoint. Japan is an ex-
cellent customer for our cotton, wheat, and rice.
From a political standpoint it uires little im-
agination to visualize what would appen if Rus-
sia, China, and Japan became a umted hostile
group in the Paciﬁc.
It was difﬁcult enough for the United States to
defeat Japan when Japan fought alone in the
Paciﬁc with China its enemy and Russia neutral.
The free world must shun economic policies which
would press Japan into becoming the ally or the
tool of Communist China and Soviet Russia.

At the moment, Indochina is the area where
international communism most vigorously seeks
expansion under the leadership of Ho Chi-Minh.
Last year President Eisenhower, in his great
“Chance for Peace” address,2 said that “aggres-
sion in Korea and Southeast Asia are threats to
the whole free community to be met by united
action.” But the French were then opposed to
what they called “internationalizing” the war.
They preferred to treat it as a civil war of re-
bellion. However, on July 3, 1953, the French
Government made a public declaration of inde-
pendence for the three Associated States, and in
September it adopted the so-called Navarre plan,
which contemplated a rapid buildup of national
native forces. The United States then agreed to
underwrite the costs of this plan.
But last winter the ﬁghting was intensiﬁed and
the long strain began to tell in terms of the atti-
tude of the French people toward a war then in its
eighth year. Last March, after the siege of Dien-
Bien-Phu had begun, I renewed President Eisen-
hower’s proposal that we seek conditions which
would permit a united defense for the area. I
went to Europe on this mission, and it seemed
that there was agreement on our proposal. But
when we moved to translate that proposal into
reality, some of the parties held back because
they had concluded that any steps to create a

united defense should await the results of the
Geneva Conference.
Meanwhile, the burdens of a collective defense
in Indochina have mounted. The Communists
have practiced dilatory negotiating at Geneva,
while intensifying their ﬁghtin in Indochina.
The French and national forces eel the strain of
mounting enemy power on their front and of po-
litical uncertainty at their rear. I told the Senate
Forei Relations Committee last week that the
situation is grave but by no means hopeless.8 The
future depends largely on decisions awaited at
Paris, London, and Geneva.
The situation in Indochina is not that of open
military agigression by the Chinese Communist
regime. T us, in Indochina, the problem is one
of restoring tranquillity in an area where dis-
turbances are fomented from Communist China,
but where there is no open invasion by Com-
munist China. This task of aciﬁcation, in our
opinion, cannot be successfu ly met merely by
unilateral armed intervention. Some other con-
ditions need to be established. Throughout these
Indochina develo ments, the United States has
held to a stable an consistent course and has made
clear the conditions which, in its opinion, might
justify intervention. These conditions were and
are 1) an invitation from the present lawful au-
thorities; (2 clear assurance of complete inde-
pendence to aos, Cambodia and Viet-Nam; (3)
evidence of concern by the United Nations; (4) a
joining in the collective effort of some of the other
nations of the area; and (5) assurance that France
will not itself withdraw from the battle until it
is won.
On] if these conditions were realized could the
Presi ent and the Congress be justiﬁed in asking
the American people to make the sacriﬁces inci-
dent to committing our Nation, with others, to
using force to help to restore peace in the area.
Another problem might, however, arise. If the
Chinese Communist regime were to show in Indo-
china or elsewhere that it is determined to pursue
the path of overt military aggression, then the
situation would be different and another issue
would emerge. That contingency has already
been referred to publicly by the President and
myself. The President, in his April 16, 1953, ad-
dress, and I myself, in an address of September 2,
1953,‘ made clear that the United States would
take a grave view of any future overt military
Chinese Communist aggression in relation to the
Paciﬁc or Southeast Asia area. Such an aggres-
sion would threaten island and peninsular posi-
tions which secure the United States and its allies.
If such overt military aggression occurred, that
would be a deliberate threat to the United States
itself. The United States would of course invoke
