Global Relations of the United States
by S. Whittemore Boggs
Even the colonial beginni of the United
States may be regarded as dim prophetic of the
worldwide relationships of t e resent time.
Edmund Burke, in his famous speec on concilia-
tion with the Colonies paid e1 uent tribute to
the hardih00d and skill of the co onial American
whalers; and the whale ﬁsheries of the world be-
came predominantly American for decades, well
into the 19th century. The American Declaration
of Independence expressed “a decent respect to
the opinions of mankind.” The American ﬂag
ﬁrst appeared at Canton, China, in 1784, and
Antarctic sealskins came to be important in the
“China trade” a little later.
But beginning with the turn of the 20th cen-
tury, there came a great change in the external
relations of the Umted States. They have at-
tained truly global pro ortions—in economics,
international politics, an cultural relations. No
head-in-the-sand psychosis, no delirium of chau-
vinism, can eradicate the fact that the United
States has unwittingl and ineradicably achieved
lobal relations. To ay there is not a cranny of
t e globe that is not good for a headline even in
a smalltown newspaper in the United States, if
there is a news item sufﬁciently lurid or frighten-
ing or appealing to our sympathies. While some
persons, if it were ossible, would probably roll
up the oceans, buildp a high wall around our bor-
ders, or secede from the earth, even such extrem-
ists would not deny themselves the use of an auto-
mobile or a radio simply because it incorporates
many materials which can be obtained most eco-
nomlcally onl from other continents or distant
islands—tin or solder, aluminum, manganese,
rubber, vanadium, and scores of other items. A
brief article, even if devoted solely to the world-
wide economic relations of the United States,
could scarcel do full justice to that single phase
of our globa relations.
All of the earth’s nearly 2,500 million human
inhabitants now live in a world of continually
expanding relationships. Our fascinating little
earth seems to be a “rapidly shrinking world”
only because of the ever geographically widenin
outreach of communications, tran ort, and trave
available to individual human ings and so-
cieties—which is the truly signiﬁcant factor.
These new POWers do not solve world problems;
they ameliorate a few, create new ones, and aggra-
vate others. We recall the story of “Benn and
the Bird-dogs” by Marjorie Kinnan Raw ings:
“Now utting an automobile under Uncle Benny
Was like putting wings on a wild-cat—it just
opened up new territory.”
Roadblock To Understanding Global Relatlona
A serious roadblock to understanding the new
global relations of the United States is misconcep-
tion of simple graphical relationshigi. This
is in large part ue to wides read use of creator
and some of the other worl maps in school text-
books, newspapers, and now even on television.
It is disconcerting to discover how many people
are quite oblivious to the characteristics of the
maps they use. And among those whose job it is
to prepare maps—seldom geographers or cartog-
raphers—few have an adequate knowledge of map
projections and of the properties of the maps they
make with which to convey basic information.
The Mercator is used more frequently than all
other projections put together, and almost never
does one see an equal-area projection. The fact
that the world is round is taught, I suppose, in all
American schools. And most gleople have been
told that a great circle is the s ortest route be_
tween two pomts on earth.
The fact that, between any two 'ven points on
the earth, the “great circle route” is shorter than
any “small circle route” is illustrated by the fol-
lowing roblem: A man has a gun that Will
shoot 0 y 30 rods; he sees, shoots and kills a bear
that is 40 rods due east of him. how do you ac-
count for it? And what is the color of the bear?
