Figure 7. The map-maker’s conventional Western and
Eastern Hemispheres
The usual line of separation is the pair of meridians
20° west and 160° east of Greenwich. The white-ocean
hemisphere at the bottom on the left, and in the center
of the world map on the Miller cylindrical projection map
at the top, is the conventional Western Hemisphere, and
the other is the equally conventional Eastern Hemisphere.
The map at the top shows that this Western, Hemisphere
is exactly as much east as it is west of the Eastern
Hemisphere. The letters N and S are at the north and
south geographical poles. The letters A to F inclusive
are at identical points on all three maps, and the curved
lines on the Miller map are identical with the correspond-
ing straight lines (great circles) on the two circular
hemisphere maps. 0 is the center of the Western Berni,
sphere and P is the center of the Eastern Hemisphere.
Sum Total of All U.S. l-lemlspheres
If a transparent plastic hemisphere be so placed
on a globe that it just covers the United States
and touches at the northernmost points of \Vash-
ington and Maine, it will cover the hemisphere
shown at the left in ﬁgure 11, which includes Ant-
arctica and southeastern Australia, as well as
South America and major parts of the Atlantic,
Paciﬁc, and Indian Oceans.
A series of four or more similar hemispheres
may be mapped, tangent successively at the outer-
most points of Maine and Florida, Florida and
Texas, Texas and California, and ﬁnally the Pa-


ciﬁc coast of the United States. The results are
represented on the world map on the Briesemeis-
ter elli tical equal-area pro1ection (ﬁgure 12).
Four 0 the tangent great circles that limit the
hemispheres embracin all of the United States
are shown, each in a distinctive line symbol com-
pletely encirclin the earth. These include the
tangent lines A , BC DE, and EA (omitti
CD). These great circles, tan ent to the invartgﬁ
outline mirror image of the nited States in the
Indian Ocean, outline the on] art of the earth
no part of which can be incluilled) in a hemisphere
which embraces the whole of so-called continental
United States (the 48 States and the District of
Columbia). The lar est bit of land within that
most remote area is esolate Kerguelen Island—
of interest today only in weather reporting.
Therefore, if someone speaks of “this hemi-
sphere” as the hemisphere in which the United
States is located, it 1s relevant to ask “Which
hemisphere?”
Thus there is no human being anywhere on
earth who does not live in some hemisphere that
includes all of the United States. This brings to
mind Edwin Markham’s quatrain entltled
“Outwitted”:
He drew a circle that shut me out-—
Heretic, rebel, a thing to ﬂout.
But Love and I had the wit to win:
We drew a circle that took him in.
The peoples of every “culture world” are there-
fore geogra hically nearer to the United States
than most oi) us realize—none so remote that they
do not live in what we might call “an American
hemisphere.” The peoples of each of these cul-
tures take natural pride in their own distinctive
wag of life, in their religious faith and philosophy,
an in the community of their social institutions.
They do not wish to be indiscriminately mixed
with all the other peoples of the world, as we now
homogenize milk, because each regards itself in
some cherished way as the cream of all the world’s

a


Figure 8. Panama-Tokyo hemisphere
The point 0 at the center of the hemisphere map on the
left is the point midway on the great circle between
Panama and Tokyo, which is the straight line P—T on this
map, about 7,320 geographical or nautical miles in length.
The white-ocean area on the Miller map at the right is
the same hemisphere, and the curve P—O—T is the same
great circle course.
