he survey does not mention the considerable
rogress that was also made in the relaxation of
European barriers against imports from North
America—progress which offers much hope for
improved efﬁciency and closer economic coopera-
tion among the major trading countries of the
world. This combination of an a preciable liber-
alization of imports from the dol ar area with an
actual decline in dollar purchases is of major sig-
niﬁcance. It underlines the survey’s view that a
structural shift in Europe’s dollar position has
occurred which “has clearly been important.”
Maln Threats to Continued Expanslon
The survey sees two main threats to continued
economic expansion in \Vestern Europe: First,
uncertainties as to the future course of the U.S.
economy; and, secondly, what the survey sees as
the temporary character of some of the major
factors underlying the improvement in the ex-
ternal position of Western Europe. It a pears to
be these two factors which chieﬂy un erlie the
survey’s judgment that overnments may well
“hesitate to undertake rea y expansive policies of
any kind because of two fears, those of inﬂation
and of balance of payments difﬁculties.”
We consider the “special, and sometimes clearly
temporary, features” which are said to underlie
the external improvement both less special and less
temporary than the survey suggests. After ver
nearly 10 years of postwar ex erience, the hi
level of business activity in the .S. can hardlyie
considered a “special” feature or a “temporary”
one. It is, of course, true that the possibility of
temporary dips in that high level cannot be ruled
out; and it is equally true that the United States
economy has for some months now been in a phase
of read ustment as a result of the decline of inven-
tory a ditions and lower defense expenditures.
But this readjustment has been roceeding at a
ver high level, and in an atmosp ere of business
an ﬁnancial conﬁdence.
You may be sure that we in the United States
are just as anxious to maintain a high level of
economic activity as you are to have us do so.
The uncertainties of economic forecasting are as
well known as the tendencies of economists to dis-
agree among themselves. It may be worth recall-
ing here, however, the remarkable _degree of una-
nimity among American economists as to_ the
moderate character of the pros ective readjust-
ment, and useful to note the asic factors of
strength which underlie this unanimity. The
reat majority of economists agree that 1954 is
likely to be the second-best ear in American
economic history; and few see in the present situ-
ation serious threats for the lon r-term future.
These views are based on the ba anced character
of the postwar expansion, which has progressed
without ﬁnancial or speculative excesses and with-
out undue dependence on an single source of
stimulus; on the structural clianges which have
been introduced into the American economy over
the past 20 years; and on the continuing strength
of business and consumer demand.
The outlook for consumer ex nditures is fa-
vorable. Consumer savings are arge and widely
distributed and the reduction of individual taxes
which has taken lace and which is contemplated
should, among 0t er factors, stimulate consumer
purchases. Demand for housing remains strong
and building activity is expected to continue at
close to the high levels of 1953. Although Federal
Government expenditures will decline somewhat,
they will continue to be a strong sustaining factor
in the economy, and State and local purchases will
probably increase.
One of the most important reasons for conﬁ-
dence in the future is the expectation that business
ﬁrms will maintain their plant and equi ment
expenditures at high levels. This is a re ection
of the fact that industry generally is in a strong
ﬁnancial position and has incentives to expand.
Let us be speciﬁc. You all know of the central
importance of the American automobile industry
in our economy and the sensitivity of this industry
to ﬂuctuations in economic activity. It is a source
of much encouragement to us that this industry
is optimistic about the coming year, having an-
nounced ﬁrm plans for substantially increased
investment. Recent sales and production ﬁgures
tend to support this optimism. New car sales
in February improved by 12 percent over January,
and factory production schedules for March have
been tentatively set at 22 percent over the F ebru-
ar¥ﬁgure
inally, in this review of the main factors of
strength in our economy, I should like to empha-
size the administration’s determination to act
uickly and vigorously if serious recessionar
forces should develop. To quote the President's
own words: “The arsenal of weapons at the dis-
posal of the Government for maintaining economic
stability is formidable. We shall not
hesitate to use any or all of these weapons as the
situation may re uire.”
In addition to eing determined to use its full
powers to combat a serious recessionary threat if it
should develop, the U.S. administration is also
fully aware of the international impact of even
moderate readjustments in the U.S. In a recent
statement Governor Stassen expressed the readi-
ness of the United States to consult with European
countries on this aspect of the problem. \Ve wel-
come opportunities for such mutual consultation
and have already undertaken several such
exchanges.
Certain delegates have expressed concern at the
fact that in the past a decline in economic ac-
tivity in the United States has resulted in a das-
