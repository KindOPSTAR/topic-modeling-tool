censorship practices and protection of sources of
information of news personnel as priority respon-
sibilities for the rapporteur and the Council in the
comin year. I would like to stress, however, that
our jo should be to create better understanding
rather than to train pro-United Nations propa-
gandists. Newsmen cannot be ex ected to propa-
gandize for any cause, no matter 0w good it may
e. Their job is to provide information.
There are also a number of general proposals to
encourage better rofessional training of infor-
mation personnel in the Secretary-General’s rec-
ommendations. These include encouragement of
the establishment of professional training courses
in underdevelo ed countries, the facilitation of
entry into the eveloped countries of persons de-
sirin to improve their professional qualiﬁcations
and t e use of experts to assist in the training of
rofessional workers in underdevelo (1 countries.
hese proposals offer similar possibi ities for con-
structive action.
Mr. President, we can use our resources intelli-
gently and imaginatively to stimulate the grass-
roots development of free information enterprises,
to lift government restrictions against their
growth, and to encourage responsible journalism.
at we must approach these tasks realistically.
The seed of a free press is present ever where
where people are free to think and to spea . We
cannot create that seed, but we can help nurture its
growth and guard against those who—out of ig—
norance or hostility—would stiﬂe the development
of one of man’s most precious freedoms.
Kidnapping of American Journalists
This task requires unceasing vigilance. The
forces of darkness have already enveloped 800
million ca tive peo le in the world behind the
Iron and amboo urtains. Their totalitarian
tentacles have even reached out to enfold foreign
correspondents, for these re imes are so patho-
logically suspicious and afraid of honest report-
ing that they equate the quest for news with
espionage. N 0 one can forget the case of \Villiam
Oatis who spent more than two years in a Czech
jail because he tried to cover the news. F ortu-
nately, Mr. Oatis is now free and is pursuing his
profession here at the United Nations—covering
the meetin s of this Council—where it is not a
crime to as ' a delegate questions.
And this was not an isolated case. On March
21, 1953, two other American journalists, Donald
Dixon and Richard Applegate, were seized by a
Chinese Communist unboat while sailing in a
yacht in internationaT waters from Hong Kong
to Macao. For more than a year these newspaper-
men have been held incommunicado in a Chinese
Communist jail, while the authorities of that re-
gime have ignored completely the repeated in-
quiries and protests from my government, and
from relatives, friends, and colleagues of the un-
fortunate journalists and their traveling com-
panions who were seized with them.
Indeed, the Chinese Communists have never
deigned to re ly to requests for information on
this brutal ki nappin —this act of piracy on the
hi h seas. Dixon an A plegate now ﬁnd them-
se ves imprisoned by the C inese Communists like
30 other American citizens. The only crimes of
these 32 appear to have been that they were Ameri-
can journalists, missionaries, or businessmen or
students. All these Americans have been kept in
Chinese Communist jails, some for 3 or more years,
in complete ignorance of the charges on which they
are held. They have been denied counsel, and they
have even been refused basic personal needs.
Many have been subjected to ph Sical and mental
tortures designed to extract fa se confessions of
guilt. It is a tragic fact that some Americans pre-
viously jailed by the Chinese Communists are
known to have died as a result of bestial treatment.
It is an evil thing when freedom of information
is suppressed throu h censorship and repressive
regulations. But w en this freedom is destroyed
by the physical snatching away and imprisoning
of journalists, then it is a matter deservin of the
greatest condemnation and forthright action.
Mr. President, through this Council I am ap-
pealin to world (public opinion in an effort to
prevai upon the hinese Communist regime to
release from its custody Donald Dixon, Richard
Applegate, and the other Americans held in Chi-
nese Communist jails or otherwise prevented from
leaving Communist China. I am also serving no-
tice that the United States will keep this issue alive
in appropriate organs of the United Nations and
wherever else it ma prove hel ful. This to the
end that these victims of the oes of truth and
freedom may be liberated and that Milton’s
words—“whoever knew truth put to the worse”—
will once again be vindicated.
REFUTATION OF SOVIET STATEMENTS
U.S./U..\‘ press release 1903 dated April 13
When I listened to the remarks of the Soviet
delegate, it reminded me somewhat of the hero
in Stephen Leacock’s pla who mounted his horse
and rode furiously in all directions.
The Soviet delegate evidenced acute reaction
against the criticism of the rapporteur’s report,
and the very violence of the reaction is the best
indication to me that the criticism was well di-
rected. In the United States we welcome criti-
cism, especially honest, constructive criticism, as
that is the way we all learn and progress in my
country. That points up one major difference in
the speeches of the delegates around this table on
freedom of information over the last two days.
There has been honest criticism against the dis-
honest criticism that we just heard; real difference
