position, as I say, because that has to be taken into
account in reaching political decisions.
Asked about reports that the Administration
might ask Congress to adopt some sort of resolu-
tion on the Indochina situation, Mr. Dulles
replied:
There is no present plan for going to Congress
for any authority in this matter. As is well
known, the general scheme which the United
States has had for this area and which I have al-
ready described here, would, if it were imple-
mented, probably require congressional actlon.
But there has so far not been a sufﬁciently general
acceptance of the program to make it, as a matter
of practical politics, a question of going to
Congress.
Discussions Concerning Americans
Detalned in Communist China
Following are texts of statements issued at Ge-
no va on May 29 and June 5 by the U. S. delegation
to the Geneva Conference:
STATEMENT OF MAY 29
The attention of the United States Delegation
has been drawn to news conferences held this week
by the press spokesman of the Chinese Communist
Delegation, at which the matter of American citi-
zens imprisoned in Communist China has been dis-
cussed.
The Chinese spokesman has acknowledged that
20 or 30 Americans are under arrest. He named
six of them.
While this quasi-ofﬁcial conﬁrmation of the lot
and whereabouts of these Americans is welcome,
the United States Delegation must point out that
it is tragically late in coming, and that the infor-
mation is woefully inadequate.
For four years, the United States Government
has made persistent efforts to obtain information
about American citizens detained in China. Their
families have made similar attempts. Until now,
however, the Chinese Communist authorities have
failed even to acknowledge the inquiries addressed
to them, let alone provide the information
requested.
In most instances, the United States Govern-
ment and the families concerned have been unable
to ﬁnd out whether these persons are alive or dead.
To cite one example: In 1952, an American mis-
sionary died in prison in Canton, as the result of
gross mistreatment. Not until six months later,
by roundabout ways, did word of his death reach
the outside world. There has not yet been an
June 2|, 1954
ofﬁcial communication about it from the Chinese
authorities.
The Chinese Communist press spokesman is re-
ported to have said that, in future, relatives will
be allowed to send letters to the Americans held in
prison. This, too, is welcome, and it is to be
hoped that other steps to improve their lot will
follow. But it must e pointed out that to receive
mail is an elementary privilege, which ought to
have been granted from the beginning.
The United States Government and peo le con-
tinue to be deeply concerned about the we fare of
those Americans, civilian and military, who have
been imprisoned by the Chinese Communist au-
thorities, or otherwise prevented from returning
to the United States. They continue to desire full
information as to their whereabouts and wellbeing.
The United States Government will continue to
make every feasible effort to bring about the re-
lease of these citizens.
The Chinese Communist spokesman also spoke
of Chinese students and other Chinese nationals
residing in the United States; and, on this matter,
he made some statements that are without founda-
tion in fact, and others that constitute grave dis-
tortion of the facts.
Here are the facts:
When the Communists by force of arms con-
quered mainland China, several thousand Chinese
students were attending American schools and
universities. The overwhelming majority chose,
pf gleir own free will, not to return to their home-
an .
A number, however, did wish to return to China.
Until the outbreak of the Korean war, and the
Chinese Communists’ aggression in Korea, they
were permitted freely to do so; in 1949 and 1950,
approximately 1,000 Chinese students departed
from the United States.
In June 1951—under the authority of the Pass-
port Control Act of 1918 (as amended in 1941),
which authorized the President to control the de-
parture of aliens, and, subsequently, under Sec-
tion 215 (a) 1 of the Immigration and Nationality
Act of 1952, which superseded the Passport Act of
HIS—regulations were issued setting up controls
over the departure of certain foreign nationals
from the United States.
This was at a time when the United States was
serving as the United Nations command in Korea,
and these regulations were designed to protect the
security of the United States and its allies in that
war.
Since 1951, 434 Chinese students have applied
for exit permits. Of these. 314 have been per-
mitted to depart—150 in 1951, 53 in 1952, 84 in
1953, 27 in 1954. For security reasons, exit per-
mits were temporarily denied the other 120.
(Since October, 1953, only four Chinese have been
denied permission to leave; the last refusal took
place in January, 1954.) The Attorney General
