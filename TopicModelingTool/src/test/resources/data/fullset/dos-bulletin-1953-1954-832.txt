communist movement, extending to this hemi-

power, won (1 constitute a threat to the sovereignty

3. Guatemala is the only American nation to be
the recipient of a massive shipment of arms from
behind the Iron Curtain.
It has been suggested from Guatemala that it
needs more armament for defense. Alread Gua-
temala is the heaviest armed of all the entral
American States. Its military establishment is
three to four times the size of that of its neighbors
such as Nicara ua, Honduras, or El Salvador.
The recent s lipment was effected under condi-
tions which are far from normal. The shi ment
was loaded at the Communist-administere Port
of Stettin. The ship was cleared for Dakar,
Africa. The operation was cloaked under a series
of chartering arran ements so that the real ship-
per was very diﬂicu t to discover. When he was
discovered he claimed that the shi ment consisted
of nothing but optical glass and la ratory equip-
ment. When the ship was diverted from its os-
tensible destination and arrived at Puerto Barrios,
it was landed under conditions of extraordinary
secrecy and in the ersonal presence of the Min-
ister of Defense. ne cannot but wonder why if
the operation was an aboveboard and honorable
one, all of its details were so masked.
By this arms shipment a government in which
Communist inﬂuence is very stron has come into
a position to dominate militariTy the Central
American area. Already the Guatemalan Gov-
ernment has made estures against its nei hbors
which they deem to be threatening and whic have
led them to appeal for aid.
The Guatemalan Government boasts that it is
not a colony of the United States. We are roud
that Guatemala can honestly say that. The nited
States is not in the business of collecting colonies.
The important question is whether Guatemala is
subject to Communist colonialism, which has al-
ready subjected 800 million people to its despotic
rule. The extension of Communist colonialism to
this hemisphere would, in the words of the Caracas
Resolution, endanger the peace of America.
‘ BULLETIN of Apr. 26, 1954, p. 638.
SecretagaDu-lles was asked whether his state-
ment on temala left the implication that the
sending of arms to Guatemala from behind the
Iron Curtain might properly be covered by the
Resolution of Uaraeas or the Rio T reaty.’ Mr.
Dulles made the following reply:
The whole question of determining the circum-
stances justifying invoking the Rio Treaty is being
studied. The evidence is being accumulated. We
don’t have it all at the present time, and until it
is accumulated and until we have exchanged views
with other American countries no decision has
been made as to whether or not to invoke the con-
sultative processes of the Rio Treaty.
Asked under what conditions the United States
might act, whether alone or through implementa-
tion of the Rio Pact, Mr. Dulles replied:
We would expect to act under the Rio Pact,
and in full conformity with our treaty obligations.
No member of the Rio Pact gives up what the
charter of the United Nations calls the inherent
right of individual or collective self-defense; that
right is reserved. Nevertheless, it is contemplated
that, if the circumstances permit, there should be
an effort, a sincere effort, at collective action and
we would expect to comply with both the letter
and the spirit of our treaty obligations.
Asked whether the United States intends to take
the initiative in invoking the consultative clause
of the Rio Treaty in the event none of the other
member countries do so, Mr. Dulles replied:
That is an academic question because we know
there are others who are prepared to take the in-
itiative if the further development of the facts
indicate there is a clear case on which to act.
Asked whether there would not be some delay
in bringing about the implementation of the Rio
Treaty, Mr. Dulles replied:
It would be possible to get very quick action by
the consultative organ of the American States.
They can be called into a meeting almost on 24~
hour notice. I would not anticipate any difﬁculty
if that event occurred in having very prompt and
decisive action taken by the consultative organ.
