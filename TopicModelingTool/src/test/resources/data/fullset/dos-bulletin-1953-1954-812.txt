Consular Offices in Mexico
To Be Reorganized
Press release 271 dated May 21
U.S. consular ofﬁces in Mexico will be reorgan-
ized on July 1, 1954, to improve facilities in those
areas where demand for consular services is
heaviest and eliminate them in places where it is
not sufﬁcient to justify their maintenance. This is
a. further step in the program begun in 1953, under
which improved service and speed have been pro-
vided through concentration of immigration visa
work at certain oﬂices strategically located
throughout Mexico.
‘ Not in force.
’ Signed subject to approval.
The present move will provide needed addi-
tional personnel, higher efﬁciency, and improved
service at the consular ofﬁces in Mexico City,
Ciudad Juarez, Tijuana, Guadalajara, and Mata-
moros. Oﬁices at Mexicali, N ogales, Piedras
Negras, Nuevo Laredo, Tampico, Monterre ,
Veracruz, and Merida are already adequate y
staffed and will remain in their present status,
while those at Reynosa, Chihuahua, San Luis
Potosi, and Mazatlan will be closed.
Greatly improved transportation and communi-
cations facilities throughout Mexico in recent
years have eliminated the need for U.S. consular
representatives to be stationed at every city of
importance and will permit continuation of the
close cultural and commercial ties existing between
the people of the United States and those of the
cities where oliices are being closed.
Because of the demand for visas from Mexican
visitors to the United States and the U.S. desire
to assist these travelers in every way, no border
consulates, with the exception of eynosa, are
being closed. Residents of the Reynosa. area
traveling east will be able to obtain visas at Mata-
moros, while those traveling west can get them
at Nuevo Laredo. Border crossing cards continue
to be available from U.S. immigration oﬂicers at
all border points for Mexican residents desiring
to enter the United States for brief visits in the
frontier communities. Mexican residents of the
interior will continue to be able to obtain visas and
other services at Merida, Veracruz, Tampico,
Monterrey, Guadalajara, and Mexico City.

Foreign Relations of the United States, 1936,
Volume 11, Europe, released on May 15 by the De-
partment of State, contains the diplomatic record

Union for 1936 are omitted from this volume, hav-
ing been included in Foreign Relations of the

Papers printed in Volume II of special political
interest are for the most part those dealing with
Nazi control in Germany and with the beginning
and early stages of the Spanish Civil \Var. With
most countries the diplomatic relations of the
United States concerned matters of commerce, the
liberal trade policies urged by Secretary of State
Cordell Hull ﬁnding little acceptance, especially
with the totalitarian governments of Germany
and Italy. Reciprocal trade agreements were
