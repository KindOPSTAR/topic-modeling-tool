Report on the Tenth Inter-American Conference
by William G. Bo'wdte'r
The Tenth Inter-American Conference met at
Caracas, Venezuela, from March 1 to 28. All the
American Re ublics participated with the excep-
tion of Costa Iitica, but provision was made under
which that Government may adhere to the Final
Act. The Conference dealt with an agenda. of 28
items covering the whole range of inter-American
relations—juridical-political, economic, social, cul-
tural, and organizational matters. It adopted 117
resolutions and 3 conventions. The Conference
was also the forum in which Colombia and Peru
announced the conclusion of a satisfactory agree-
ment on the Haya de la Torre asylum case, a dis-
ute which had been a constant source of tension
tween the two countries for the past 5 years.
Jurldlcal-Politloal Matters
Onev of tlmrincipal objectives of the United
States delegation to thFl‘e'nth Inter-American
Conference, ’by "Secretary
Dulles,1 was to achieve maximum agreement among
the AmQPiceniBePﬁbliQSilT'd—W cleinwtand un-
mistakable. olgzy determination against the inter-
vention_ intérDEE-Wiism in the
h her ecognipmg the co_ntinuing threat
which it uses to their @66le securit and de-
clarin Tigeiﬁiiﬁﬁtion'go take eﬁ'ective measures,
ilnlili ually and collectively, to combat it. The
United States proposed a resolution to this effect
entitled “Declaration of Solidarity for the Preser-
vation of the Political Integrity of the American
States Against International Communist Inter-
vention” (Annex A). The distinguishing feature
of the resolution adopted, which marks a signiﬁ-
cant advance over the stands taken previously in
inter-American meetings at Bogota in 1948 and
Washington in 1951, is the declaration:
That the domination or control of the political institu-
tions of any American State by the international com-
munist movement, extending to this hemisphere the polit-
ical system of an extracontinental power, would

constitute a threat to the sovereignty and political inde-
pendence of the American States, endangering the peace
of America, and would call for a meeting of consultation
to consider the adoption of appropriate action in accord-
ance with existing treaties.
Seventeen of the American Republics voted in
favor of the resolution.2 Mexico and Argentina
chose to abstain, while Guatemala cast the only
negative vote and also took the occasion to re-
nounce its adherence to the anti-Communist reso-
lutions adopted at Bogota and Washington.
Amendments to this declaration repared by
other delegations sug ested that it 1d not make
adequate revision or promoting respect for
human rig its, for the effective exercise of repre-
sentative democrac , and for the development of
economic and social\vell-being as means for com-
bating communism. Other proposed amendments
implied concern that application of the declara-
tion mi ht in some way infrin e upon the prin-
ciples o self-determination an nonintervention.
As a means of removing any doubt that the declara-
tion is aimed at preventing, and not promoting,
intervention, the United States proposed inclusion
of a clear statement that the action taken is de-
signed to the inalienable
right of eaclrstati? to choose its own form of gov-
ernment and economi tern? There/afﬁrmation
of traditionaI concepfs’o human rights and funda-
mental freedoms was included in a separate reso-
lution entitled “Declaration of Caracas” (Annex
B), as well as in other actions taken, such as the
Panamanian proposal relating to the abolition of
racial discrimination as a means of ﬁghting
communism.
The topic “Colonies and Occupied Territories
in America” received considerable attention from
a number of the delegations. Three resolutions
were presented and ado ted. Two of these, sub—
mitted by Argentina an Brazil, respectively, were
concerned with the general subject of colonialism
in the Western Hemisphere and with the areas
which are the subject of dispute between Ameri-
’ Costa Rica subsequently notiﬁed the United States of
its support of the resolution.
