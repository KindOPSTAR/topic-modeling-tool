cause Indians knew that the United States was the
ﬁrst nation to ﬁght and win independence in mod-
ern history. The writings of \Vashington, J eﬁ'er-
son, Paine, and Lincoln were ver familiar to
them. They also knew that the nited States
Government had urged Britain to grant self-
government to India. I wish to return to this
matter of foreign policy differences with India
in a moment.
Secretary of State Dulles asked me to come
back to Washington from New Delhi to help an-
swer the questions which our re resentatives in
Congress are asking as they consi er the adminis-
tration’s budget requests.z Among the requests
which President Eisenhower has proposed is an
appropriation for military and economic assistance
to foreign countries. The President has proposed
that the United States Congress appropriate a
total of $104,500,000 for economic and technical
assistance to India.
I thought I might tell you what I have been
saying to your Senators and Congressmen, many
of whom I have come to know as friends during
my career of 25 years as a Foreign Service oiiicer.
Your representatives in Washington want to know
why the United States should continue to give
economic assistance to India.
Over the last few weeks the attention of all of
us has been turned very much toward Asia, ar-
ticularly the long peninsula of Southeast sia.
Thus we have come to understand the stakes for
the free world in the tremendous and vital
struggle that has been taking lace in Indochina.
India has achieved a stable p0 itical status which,
could it be duplicated in Indochina, would cause
a large part of the world’s worries about the latter
country to vanish. Striking proof of India’s suc-
cess in democracy was the national elections held
over 2 years ago when 107 million people voted in
an atmosphere of peace and freedom. Thus, it is
surely a matter of the greatest importance to us
that India should continue to succeed in the most
enormous experiment in democracy the world has
ever seen.
A Test of Two Opposed Systems
In Asia today two huge nations are testing
two opposed systems to see which can bring its
people the greatest spiritual and material beneﬁts
in the shortest time. On the Chinese mainland,
Communist totalitarianism gripping the Chinese
people in an iron vise is attempting to achieve
rapid material gain by ruthless methods which
sacriﬁce every human and spiritual value. In
India, 360 million people, under the leadership
of a government chosen by their own votes, are

attempting to achieve similar material goals
through democratic methods which respect the po-
litical, religious, and social rights of the indiv1d-
ual. The relative degree of success achieved by
these two systems may well determine the future
of Asia.
This is not to say, of course, that a state of
democratic erfection has been achieved in India,
and few In ians would try to make such a claim.
But democracy has put down solid roots, demo-
cratic habits are becoming stronger, while great
progress has been made in driving back old socml
evils that formerly retarded India’s economic and
political develo ment.
Indians are Justly and understandably proud
of the rapid and successful transition they have
made from colonial status to independent nation-
hood but this has not blinded them to the over-
whelming character of their economic tasks.
Rather I’hdian leaders, from Nehru on down, are
acutely aware that their hard-won political rights
cannot survive for ion without real economic
progress, rogress for t e masses of India long
submerged) in hopeless overty but now emerging
to demand more and Better food, clothing, and
housing. The people of India are attacking the
causes of Indian poverty with ima ination and
boldness. The Government’s Five ear Plan of
economic development is a. well-thought-out, ma-
ture program which tackles India’s most pressing
economic difﬁculty—her shortages in food-grains—
while at the same time laying the foundations for
the widespread industrial growth which must
evolve if India is to make real progress. This
plan is not one for the socialization of India. Al-
though the state plays an important part, eat
dependence is placed on speedy expansion 0 pri-
vate indust .
Perhaps {he most important art of the plan is
the so-called community-deve 0pment program
whose aim is to improve the overall productivity
of the Indian village where over 80 percent of
India’s people live. This is being done primarily
through simple improvements in the cultivation
methods of the Indian farmer but also by improv-
ing village handicrafts, health conditions, and
communications. Most important of all, this
whole process is bringing about a real awakening
of the Indian villager from generations of inertia
and indifference.
Ninety percent of this effort is entirely Indian
but I think Americans can take justiﬁable pride
in the fact that we have made a real contribution
in men and money to the measurable economic
progress made by the Indian people since achieving
their independence. In recent years American
county agents have gone out into Indian villages
to advise on plowing, planting, and the use of
improved seeds. American health experts have
assisted in the hard struggle against malaria, the
greatest killer and disabler. American dollars
