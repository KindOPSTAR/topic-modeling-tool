organize a world community in its own image.
In an interde endent world, in which the oceans
no longer diVide us from other countries and in
which communications have become universalized,
there can be no go it alone. The United States
no lon er has the choice of isolatin itself from the
rest 0 the world. We are a wor d power. Our
interests are not and cannot be conﬁned to an one
area. They are worldwide. In concert wit our
free world allies, we must continue to pool our
strength—military, political, economic, and mor-
al—lté) the advantage of ourselves and the free
wor .
What We Hope To Achieve by Charter Review
I have stated the case for charter review, its
essentially political nature, which in turn places
certain limits on extreme pro sals. It is also
a parent from what I have said that we do not
Visualize the charter review conference as a pana-
cea, a cure-all, a magic wand which by some feat
of legerdemain can alleviate the ills of the world.
It is not our intention to foster the same kind of
over-optimism with respect to charter review
which was revalent at San Francisco in 1945.
Changes in anguage alone cannot transform the
behaVior of nations. If our view is tempered by
the knowledge that politics is the art of the os-
sible, that charter review will require the wis om
and self-restraint of statesmanship and diplomacy,
then it is legitimate to ask what do we hope to
achieve at any review conference? Would any
review conference be a futile exercise in light of
the Soviet veto on all charter amendments?
Not at all. Let me quote for you the words of
Secretary Dulles:
The existence of this veto does not mean that the Re-
view Conference ls a futility. At San Francisco each
of the nations which had joined to draft the Dumbarton
Oaks Proposals had a “veto” over changes from these pro~
posais. Nevertheless. they did not exercise that veto as
against changes which were clearly reasonable and de-
manded by world opinion. We can hope that the same
conditions will prevail at the prospective Review Con-
ference. We can reasonably make our plans on the work-
ing hypothesis that no one nation will, in fact, be able
arbitrarily to impose changes or to veto changes.’
As a minimum a review of the charter and con-
stitutional rocedures and practices should bring
greater un erstanding to our people and to the
eoples of the world as to how essential the United
lilations is to the peace, security, and well-being of
Americans and the rest of the free world. It
should bring about an understanding of the extent
to which the potentialities of the charter are being
realized. It can help measurably to refurbish the
faith we have in the present charter without rais-
ing false hopes and expectations.
This is a minimum. Our greater objective is to
strengthen the United Nations in all its aspects
'lbid., Feb. 1, 1954, p. 173.
on the premise that this will foster the national
interests of the United States and the free world.
Charter review can nurture the common consensus
among the freedom-loving peoples and thereby
make the United Nations more effective as an in-
strument of peace, security, and well-being, pro-
vided, of course, that any differences of opinion
will not be pressed to the point where the solidar-
ity of the free world is disrupted and the United
Nations is torn asunder.
The United Nations is not a brooding omni-
presence in the sky. It is not a self-operating
mechanism which will automatically maintain
and enforce peace. It is rather an instrument
which can aid us to understand the strife, trouble,
and human need which exist in the world today
and provide us with the means to work in coopera-
tion with other nations for the peaceful solution
of common problems. It is an instrument which
aﬁ'ords nations the opportunity to combine their
moral and material strength in support of the
great principles of the charter. The effective-
ness of the United Nations depends not only upon
the lettered provisions of the charter but upon
the will and determination of the peoples of the
world to make it work. To the extent that charter
review can help to develop this will and determi-
nation, it will have served the interests of the
United States and of the free world.
