U.S. Protests Actions of
Soviet Union in Germany
Following is the teat of a protest sent on April
23 by Walter Dowling, Acting U. S. High 00m-
missioner for Germany, to the Soviet High 00m-
missioner, Vladimir Semenov :
The Acting United States High Commissioner
wishes to advise the High Commissioner of the
USSR. of the following facts.
On 20 Februar 1954 a citizen of the Union of
Soviet Socialist epublics presented himself be-
fore authorities of the United States of America
in Frankfurt am Main, which is located in the
Zone of Germany under United States jurisdic-
tion, requesting protection and asylum as a politi-
cal refugee.
The applicant identiﬁed himself as Nikolai
Ev eniyevich Khokhlov, oﬂicer assigned to the 9th
Otgel of the Second Chief Directorate of the Min-
istry of Internal Affairs (MV D), Government of
the Soviet Union, and stated that he had come to
the Federal Republic of Germany by order of the
Soviet Government to carry out the assassination
of Georgiy Serge evich Okolovich, a resident of
the Federal Repu lie of Germany and a stateless
person of Russian origin.
With respect to his mission of assassination the
applicant gave the following details:
In the fall of 1953 he was chosen by the Soviet
Government to carry out the assassination of
Okolovich. He therefore ﬂew to the Eastern Sec-
tor of Berlin, Germany, where he met Hans
Kukowitsch and Kurt Weber, both residents of
Berlin, whom he conducted to Moscow in Novem-
ber. Kukowitsch and \Veber were trained in Mos-
cow in the use of assassination weapons and were
returned to Berlin on 18 December 1953.
On 14 January 1954 Khokhlov proceeded by
Soviet milita aircraft to Vienna, Austria, under
the name of osef Hofbauer and there reported
to his superior ofﬁcer, Saul Evovich Okun, Lieu-
tenant Colonel of the MVD. Khokhlov met with
Kukowitsch and Weber in Zurich, Switzerland, on
13—14 February, after which the three men pro-
ceeded to Frankfurt am Main by separate routes.
On 18 February 1954 shortly after 7: 00 . m.
Khokhlov went to the house of Okolovich, i enti-
ﬁed himself, and stated that the Government of
the Soviet Union had assigned him the mission
of assassinating Okolovich, at some convenient
time prior to 20 March 1954, but that he had no
intention of carrying out these orders which were
repugnant to his conscience and contrary to hu-
manitarian principles. After discussions with
Okolovich, Khokhlov surrendered himself to oili-
cials of the United States Government on 20 Feb-
ruary 1954, requesting asylum and protection. On
25 February 1954, Kukowitsch and Weber were
taken into custody by United States ofﬁcials in
Frankfurt am Main, and confessed their com lic-
ity in the assassination attempt described herein.
In the possession of Kukowitsch and Weber were
assassination weapons consisting of two automatic
7mm. noiseless pistols and two devices disguised
as cigarette cases containing an electrically oper-
ated mechanism for the discharge of poisoned
pellets.
Mr. Khokhlov has not only requested the asylum
and protection of this Government, but has more-
over besought on humanitarian grounds its good
oﬂices to make representations to the Government
of the Soviet Union to permit and arrange the
travel of his wife, Yelena Adamovna Khokhlova,
together with their infant son, Alexander Niko-
layevich Khokhlov, resently residin at Don 5,
Kuartira 13, Krivonikolski Pereulok, Ioscow, tel-
ephone number 3—91-95, to the Federal Republic
of Germany to rejoin him.
The foregoing events, which were followed on
15 A ril 1954 b the brutal kidnapping in Berlin
of A exander Ti'ushnovich, a prominent stateless
Eerson of Russian descent and an associate of
cor 'y Sergeyevich Okolovich, indicate a delib-
erate y outrageous and uncivilized course of con-
duct on the part of the Government of the Soviet
Union against which the Acting U.S. High Com-
missioner protests in the most v1gorous terms.
