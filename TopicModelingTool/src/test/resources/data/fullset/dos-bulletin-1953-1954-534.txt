Fifth Anniversary of NATO
STATEMENT BY PRESIDENT ElSENl-IOWER
White House press release dated April 4
Five years ago today, the signing of the North
Atlantic Treaty launched a unique working part-
nerslii among the Atlantic eoples. Their alli-
ance or the preservation 0? peace and mutual
defense a ainst Communistic aggression is now
a mighty ulwark of the free world.
NATO symbolizes the unity of free men in an
age of peril. Fourteen nations, diverse in lan-
guage and economy and custom and political struc-
ture, are joined within it because each nation is
determined to sustain its own independence.
Dedicated to a common pur ose, their strength is
multiplied, their inexhaustib e energies are pooled.
During my service with N no there were many
uniforms worn, many tongues spoken at my head-
uarters. But daily I found new inspiration in
t e unity of spirit among my comrades.
The inspiration remains with me; a cherished
memory, a heartening proof that free men—
united—can face any peril unafraid. NATO is
visible evidence that, in cooperation among the
free peoples we can best preserve our common
heritage of reedom against any threat.
REMARKS BY SECRETARY INJLLES1
DANIEL SCiiORn (CBS) : Mr. Secretary, what
beneﬁts has NATO brought us in the last 5 years?
SECRETARY DULLESI \Ve have received a number
of advantages.
First of all, NATO has helped to prevent war. A
few years ago many eople thou ht that another
world war was inevita le. Not on y has this failed
to hap en, but the danger of world war may have
receded) in recent months. If so, and I hope it is so,
this is due in large part to the growing strength
and unity of the Atlantic peoples.
N no has helped to protect free Europe against
Communist conquest. In addition to our deep
cultural and spiritual attachment to this area,
which is the fountainhead Of Western civilization,
we in the United States realize that the enslave_
ment of free Europe would give the Soviet Union

the means to attain industrial and scientiﬁc superi-
ority over our own country. This would be a ter-
rible catastrophe for the United States and the
whole free world. It is signiﬁcant that the Com-
munists have not gained any new territory in
Europe since NATO was signed.
NATO has directl sup lemented our national de-
fense system. To a , t e protection that we get
from our own arme forces is increased by allied
forces of even reater size. And in addition, we
and our NATO it lies have worked together in con-
structing a large number of joint air bases. These
bases can be used for rapid and effective retaliation
so that all told, we have gained a great deal from
NATO and can expect to gain still more as the NATO
program continues forward.
MR. SCHORRZ That sounds like a ve valuable 5
years for us. What, then, has been t e principal
shortcoming of NATO?
SECRETARY DULLEs: I would say the most seri-
ous shortcomin is simply the fact that 14 sov-
ereign nations inevitably encounter difﬁculties in
harmonizing their policies and programs. And
this difﬁculty is articularly acute in Europe,
where, of course, t iere are longstanding rivalries
and suspicions among certain nations and these
facts have hampered cooperation in the common
interest. Now, an outstanding example is found
in the fact that the German Federal Republic, with
its large population and resources, has not yet
been permitted to contribute to the collective de-
fense system. I am convinced that NATO can be
successful in the long run only if the nations of
free Europe can overcome such differences and
achieve greater cooperation amon themselves, in-
cluding a substantial degree of po itical, economic,
and military integration.
MR. SCHORR: What can be done to increase the
effectiveness of NATO in the coming years?
SECRETARY DULLI‘BZ It seems to me that the
answer to your last question gives the clue to what
should be done for the future. The nations of con-
tinental Europe need to continue their present
movement toward unity. Already considerable
progress has been made. Six of these continental
nations have already merged their coal and steel
industries into an independent, separate commu-
nity and they have also signed a treaty which will
