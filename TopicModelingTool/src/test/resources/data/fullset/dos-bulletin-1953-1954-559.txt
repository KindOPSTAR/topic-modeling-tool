is also an indication that more attention should
be directed to the production of consumer goods.
Although fears of inﬂation which have preoccu-
pied some economic leaders in Berlin are perhaps
exaggerated, means must be found to increase
mass purchasing power, cut down unemployment,
increase production, and create a more balanced
economic interchange. There has been no serious
question as to the usefulness of the types of capital
investment made so far. Proposals have been
brought forward, however, for greater diversiﬁ‘
cation and a more comprehensive effort to employ
the unemployed and to produce goods which the
unemployed can consume. Berlin is reasonably
able to compete. It should be possible under these
circumstances to reduce somewhat, at least per-
centage-wise, the importation of consumer goods.
These considerations will all inﬂuence the future
direction of the investment program with the goal
of reducing the dependence of Berlin on outside
aid.
Unemployment in Berlin is an issue over which
the Communists are constantly endeavoring to
make political capital. Just before his death in
September 1953, Mayor Renter of Berlin, in
thanking President Eisenhower for the gift of
food from the United States to the people of
the Soviet Zone of Germany, raised the Problem
of unemployment in Berlin in the following
words:‘
You know that in spite of all diﬂiculties, the people of.
Berlin have never been diverted from their determination
to maintain and defend the freedom and independence of
Berlin. Without the unparalleled attitude of the
Berliners during the last years, the revolts of June 16 and
17 which attracted the attention of the whole world would
have never happened. Therefore,‘l should like to express
my conviction and hope that, the stronger and healthier
Berlin is as a whole, the greater will also be the power
radiating from the city into the surrounding Soviet Zone.
Therefore, the reduction of the number of unemployed in
Berlin is an urgent political and moral concern of the
entire free world. If we succeed in creating before long
another 50 to 100 thousand places of work, we shall be in
a position to add another decisive victory to the moral and
political success achieved by the events of June 16 and 17
and the distribution of food which is still being carried
through.
President Eisenhower showed his awareness of
Berlin’s problems by responding to Mayor
Renter’s appeal in the following words: ‘
The American people have not lost sight of the serious
diﬁiculties with which the people of West Berlin must
cope so long as they are separated from their fellow
Germans in the East and West, and cannot enjoy free
communication and unimpeded access to supplies of raw
materials and markets for their production. While great
progress has been made in raising the level of economic
activity and employment in West Berlin we all realize
that much remains to be done. The present investment
and work relief programs in Berlin were, I am informed,
carefully developed in the light of the needs of Berlin and
the ability of the Berlin authorities, business and labor,

to assist in the creation of additional jobs in existing t-
new enterprises.
I have no doubt that the Berlin authorities can improve
present programs in consultation with the Bonn authori-
ties and the Oﬂice of the United States High Commis-
sioner. If proposals can be devised which would give
promise of a further substantial increase in employment
in Berlin, the United States Government would be pre-
pared to explore with the Federal Republic what further
steps the two governments might ﬁnd it possible to take
to achieve this objective.
The ideas expressed in this exchan of letters
continue to hold true in 1954, and8 President
Eisenhower’s words still represent U.S. policy
toward Berlin.

Western Powers’ Attitude
Toward East German Government
Following is the text of a joint declaration
issued at Bonn on April 8 by the U.S., French,
and British High Commissioners for Germany:
The Allied High Commission desires to clarify
the attitude of the governments which it repre-
sents toward the statement issued on March 25 by
the Soviet Government, purporting to describe a.
change in its relations with the overnment of
the so-called German Democratic Republic.1
This statement appears to have been intended to
create the impression that sovereignty has been
anted to the German Democratic Republic. It
oes not alter the actual situation in the Soviet
The Soviet Government still retains ef-
" The three governments represented in the Allied
High Commission will continue to regard the
Soviet Union as the responsible power for the
Soviet Zone of Germany. These governments do
not recognize the sovereignty of the East German
regime which is not based on free elections, and do
not intend to deal with it as a overnment. They
believe that this attitude will e shared by other
states, who, like themselves, will continue to recog-
nize the Government of the Federal Republic as
the only freely elected and legally constituted gov-
ernment in Germany. The Allied High Commis-
sion also takes this occasion to express the resolve
of its governments that the Soviet action shall not
deter them from their determination to work for
the reuniﬁcation of Germany as a free and sov-
ereign nation.
