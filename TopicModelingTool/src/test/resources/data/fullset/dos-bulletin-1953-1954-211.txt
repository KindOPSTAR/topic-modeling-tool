counted with imports. The past ear witnessed,
however, an important shift in the alance on cur-
rent transactions between the United States and
foreign countries, the broad features of which are
dis layed in Chart 24.“ Excluding transfers of
mi itary-aid goods, which require no dollar ﬁnanc-
ing by the recipient countries, the United States
had an estimated deﬁcit of 7 00 million dollars on
current account in 1953. This contrasts with a
sur lus of 1.7 billion in 1952, 10.7 billion in 1947,
an about 5.5 billion in 1948 and 1949.
Thus, the free world has continued to make
pro ess toward economic and ﬁnancial strength.
In t e postwar period, taken as a whole, foreign
economies have been able to adjust to a shar
reduction of United States economic aid sinclu -
ing loans), and still maintain a hi h leve of 1m-
ports from the United States. heir gold and
dollar holdings have increased by about 8 billion
dollars in the last ﬁve years and are now 50
percent higher than in 1937. Ofﬁcial monetary
reserves outside the sterling area are probably
better distributed today than ever before, from
the standpoint of their relation to the volume of
imports and the different needs of foreign coun-
tries for liquid balances to meet ﬂuctuations in
ex ort earnings.
umerous factors have contributed to the great
improvement in the dollar osition of foreign eco-
nomics. The outstanding actis the great increase
in their productive power, which has enabled them
to increase exports to the United States while
meeting their own enlarged domestic r uirep
ments. Some part, of course, of the current ollar
earnings of forei countries arises from our Gov-
ernment’s expen itures abroad for military goods
and services. These amounted to an estimated 2.5
billion dollars in 1953, which is equal to about 15
percent of our total payments for foreign goods
and services and about equal to the increase in
foreign holdings of gold and dollar balances
during the year. .
Chanwes since 1947 in the current account bal-
ances of major trading areas with the United
States are shown in Chart 25.2 The most notable
improvement was recorded in the transactions of
Western Europe, which closed with an estimated
surplus of 1.5 billion dollars in 1953, in contrast
to a deﬁcit of over 5 billion in 1947. The indus-
trial production of Western Europe is now run-
ning about 40 percent above 1938, and the volume
of exports has risen by some 60 percent, while
imports—includin raw materials processed for
ex ort—are only s ightly above their prewar level.

Korean deﬁcits began in mi 4952 and continued
in 1953 with the accumulation of a surplus of

sterling area countries and facilitated the adap-
tation of their economies to the collapse of the raw
materials price boom in 1951. The same was gen-
erally true of raw material exporting countries.
The current account deﬁcit of the Western Hem-
is )here in 1953 is traceable entireéy to Canada.
WllOSB deﬁcit was offset by United tates private
investments and by net exports to other countries.
The countries of Latin America, taken as a whole,
were close to a balance in their 1953 current ac-
count; but it should be noted that this resulted
artly from the tighter import controls imposed
y some of them. Difﬁcult readjustments are still
in prospect in Far Eastern countries whose normal
trade atterns were distorted by the Korean war
and o lier political disturbances.
GOVERNMENTAL POLICY IN A YEAR
OF ECONOMIC CHANGE
lntcrnatlonal Economic Policy
The aim of the Federal Government durin the
past year was to maintain stability in the ﬁe d of
commercial policy, pending a broad survey of all
aspects of our international economic relations.
At the President’s request the Congress extended
for one year the Reciprocal Trade Agreements
program without major amendment, and set up
a Commission on Foreign Economic Policy to rec-
ommend appropriate means for the improvement
of international trade—“consistent with a sound
domestic economy, our foreign economic policy,
and the trade aspects of our national securit and
total foreign policy.” In line with the Eresi—
dent’s recommendation, the Congress also enacted
the Customs Simpliﬁcation Act designed to sim-
plify, and to remove the inequities of, customs
regulations. The United States articipated in
international efforts to stabilize the markets for
wheat and sugar. Extensive military and eco-
nomic assistance to foreign countries was con-
tinued, but with the im rovement in the economic
strength of Western urope, the economic aid
program was curtailed. Emphasis was also con-
tinued on fostering im rovements in the industrial
productivity of frlen 1y countries, in the interest
of stimulating their economic development and
raising the living standards of their people.
