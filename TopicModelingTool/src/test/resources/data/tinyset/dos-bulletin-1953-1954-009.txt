the common defense. If that prospect disappears,
then the basic strategy of NATO will have to be
reexamined.
2. There is not merely the roblem of providing
German contingents, but of oing so in a form rea-
sonably acceptable to Germany’s neighbors. E00
meets this problem by limiting German forces and
providing that the ermans who are armed will
orm part of a six-power army. They will not be
subject to a German General Staff and they cannot
be used for national purposes. This gives assur-
ances to France and other nations, including the
Soviet Union, which have a legitimate concern that
Germans shall not be rearmed under conditions
which would make ossible a recurrence of such
invasions as they ave suffered from German
militarism.
3. There is the problem of ermanently sealing
the breach between France an Germany.
Twelve years a 0, as the United States formally
entered into Worlgd War II, I wrote:
Continental Europe has been the world's worst ﬁre
hazard. Now the whole structure is consumed in ﬂames.
We condemn those who started and spread the ﬁre. But
this does not mean when the time comes to rebuild that
we should reproduce a demonstrated ﬁre trap.
To my mind this is the dominant consideration.
It takes recedence over getting German divisions
under ATO, important as that is. The essen-
tial is to end, once and for all, the suicidal strife
which has long plagued the Western World. It
has so weakened it, both materially and in pres-
tige, that Western civilization can now be seriously
challenged by a materialist civilization, which,
behind a thin veneer of sanctimonious theory
actually reproduces the human degradation of
dark ages.

“Al'ternatlves” to £00
It is said that there must be alternatives to E00.
Of course, if Enc fails, there will be things to be
done. lVe are not blind to that. But I do not see
“alternatives” in the sense of other practical ways
of accomplishing the three Enc goals I mentioned.
Let us, by way of illustration, take the “alter-
native” which is most mentioned, that is, to re-
store sovereignty to the West German Republic
and then to make it a member of NATO.
That is simply said, but hardly done; at best it
accomplishes merely the ﬁrst of the three purposes
of Eve. It would bring German soldiers into
NATO.
But how about the second goal, of doing this
in a way to reassure France and Soviet Russia?
It would recreate a German national force which
could be withdrawn for national purposes at the
will of a German general staff. This is not
reassuring.
How about the third goal, of creating organic
unity in Western Europe which will assure an
ending of its suicidal strife? This great goal Will
be lost in the rebirth of nationalism.
But supposing we decided, as we might, to try
this way. Let us not imagine that the procedure
would be simple or expeditious. First, it would
call for renegotiation of the present four-power
convention designed to restore West German sov-
ereignty. That is because, as I pointed out, the
resent convention depends upon the coming into
orce of Eve. The renegotiation of that treaty
under present circumstances might not be easy, nor
is it clear that the four powers would again readily
ﬁnd themselves in a eement.
If, however, this urdle can be overcome, there
would then be the problem of bringing West
Germany into NATO. This would require ﬁrst of
all willingness on the part of West Germany to
apply for NATO membershi . This willingness
cannot be assured. Many ermans stron 1y op-
pose the re-creation of a German nationa army
with a German General Staff.
There would then be the problem of securing
the necessary amendment of the NATO treaty by
each of the 14 member nations. There are many
in France who wonder whether a French Parlia-
ment which rejected German rearmament under
the severe limits of Eve would ratify an amend-
ment to NATO which would entitle West Germany
to arm without those limitations. France has in
this matter a legal power of veto.
There are, of course, many other suggested
“alternatives.” I would not want to be understood
as rejectin an of them. But all of them, as
President isen lower has said, are “feeble.” Also,
they all would take time, a factor which cannot
now be i ored.
Power 111 forces are now here to draw together
the six nations of the proposed European Defense
Community, and Britain and the United States are
prepared to pledge to this Community their ﬁrm
support. But unless unity is achieved soon, this
historic moment may pass and different and
divisive forces may take command.
Already there is evidence of this in Europe.
The Soviet Union is playing the dangerous game
of seeming to support France and Germany
against each other. Soviet pro aganda is re-
creating in France the fears of ermany. It is
creating in Germany resentment against France,
on the ground that its indecision is prolonging an
occupation of Germany which already has lasted
for nearly 9 years since the armistice. Chancellor
Adenauer already last week found it necessary to
plead with the German people to be patient. The
fact that that plea was necessary should be a warn-
ing sign that we do not have time to burn.
We have reached one of those points where the
perfect is the greatest enemy of the good. No
doubt the E00 treaty is less than perfect. How-
ever, it does decisively pose the fateful choice. It
has become the symbol of Europe’s will to make
it possible to achieve a unity which will depend-
