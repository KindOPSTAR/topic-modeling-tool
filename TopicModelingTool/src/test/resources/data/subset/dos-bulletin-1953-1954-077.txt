quirements and our supply potential, will show us
the gaps in our mobilization base. Thus we shall
have more realistic plant expansion and stock-
piling goals. We shall speed their attainment.
This Nation is at last to have an up-to-date mobili-
zation base—the foundation of a sound defense
program.
Another part of this foundation is, of course,
our continental transport system. Some of our
vital heavy materials come increasingly from
Canada. Indeed our relations with Canada, hap-
pily always close, involve more and more the un-
breakable ties of strategic interdependence. Both
nations now need the St. Lawrence Seaway for
security as well as for economic reasons. I urge
the Congress promptly to approve our participa-
tion in its construction.
Sixth, military and nonmilitary measures for
continental defense are being strengthened. In
the current ﬁscal year we are allocating to these
purposes an increasing portion of our effort, and
in the next ﬁscal year we shall spend nearly a
billion dollars more for them than in 1953.
An indispensable part of our continental secu-
rity is our civil defense effort. This will succeed
only as we have the complete cooperation of State
governors, city mayors, and voluntary citizen
groups. With their help we can advance a co-
operative program which, if an attack should
come, would save many lives and lessen
destruction.
The defense program recommended in the 1955
budget is consistent with all the considerations
that I have just discussed. It is based on a new
military program unanimously recommended by
the Joint Chiefs of Staff and approved by me
following consideration by the National Security
Council. This new program will make and keep
America strong in an age of peril. Nothing should
bar its attainment.
The international and defense policies which I
have outlined will enable us to negotiate from a
position of strength as we hold our resolute course
toward a peaceful world. We turn now to mat-
ters which are more deﬁnitely domestic in
character, though well realizing that our situation
abroad aﬁ'ects every phase of our daily lives—
from the amount of taxes to our very state of mind.
Internal Security
Under the standards established by the new
employee security program, more than 2,200 em-
ployees have been separated from the Federal Gov-
ernment. Our national security demands that the
investigation of new employees and the evaluation
of derogatory information respecting present em-
ployees be expedited and concluded at the earliest
possible date. I shall recommend that the Con-
gress provide additional funds where necessary to
speed these important procedures.
From the special employment standards of the
Federal Government I turn now to a matter re-
lating to American citizenship. The subversive
character of the Communist Party in the United
States has been clearly demonstrated in many
ways, including court proceedings. We should
recognize by law a fact that is plain to all thought-
ful citizens—that we are dealing here with actions
akin to treason, that when a citizen knowingly par-
ticipates in the Communist conspiracy he no longer
holds allegiance to the United States.
I recommend that Congress enact legislation
to provide that a citizen of the United States who
is convicted in the courts of hereafter conspiring
to advocate the overthrow of this Government by
force or violence be treated as having, by such act,
renounced his allegiance to the United States and
forfeited his United States citizenship.
In addition, the Attorney General will soon ap-
pear before your committees to present his recom-
mendations for needed additional legal weapons
with which to combat subversion in our country
and to deal with the question of claimed immunity.
Strong Economy
I turn now to the second great purpose of our
Government: Along with the protection of free-
dom, the maintenance of a strong and growing
economy.
The American economy is one of the wonders
of the world. It undergirds our international po-
sition, our military security, and the standard of
living of every citizen. This administration is
determined to keep our economy strong and to
keep it growing.
At this moment, we are in transition from a
wartime to a peacetime economy. I am conﬁdent
that we can complete this transition without seri-
ous interruption in our economic growth. But
we shall not leave this vital matter to chance.
Economic preparedness is fully as important to the
Nation as military preparedness.
Subsequent special messages and the economic
report on January 28 will set forth economic plans
