The Precarlous Foundltlon
So far, so good. However, if we go farther and
delve dee er, it is not so good. NATO has become
a splendi structure. But it rests upon a founda~
tion which is precarious and which must cause us
grave concern.
United States postwar policy has consistently
recognized the imperative necessity of a closer
integration of Western Europe. Congress ex-
pressed that when it ado ted the Euro )ean Re-
covery Program in 1948, w en it ratiﬁed tlie North
Atlantic Treaty in 1949, and when it subsequently
provided economic and military assistance to Eu-
rope. In so doing, our Congress was not impos-
ing an American concept on Europe. It was en-
dorsing a conviction that every Western European
statesman of this generation has eloquently and
forceful] expressed.
Actual y, much progress has been made toward
economic, military, and political unity.
A Coal and Steel Communit has already been
created and the possibility of roader unity now
resides in the treaty to create a European Defense
Communit Enc). This treaty was signed in
May 1952 by rance, Italy, Belgium, the Nether-
lands, Luxembourg and the West German Repub-
lic. In essence, this treaty provided for the
establishment of a common military force, drawn
from the six countries, which would be placed
under common institutions created by them.
They would operate under a single budget, with
common procurement of military equipment.
They wou d have similar uniforms and training
and would be put at the disposal of the NATO
Supreme Commander.
t the same time that this EDC treaty was
signed, the United States, the United Kingdom,
and France signed a convention with the West
German Republic designed, in effect, to end the
postwar occupation.‘ This convention, however,
rovides that it does not come into force unless the
DC treaty comes into force.
It was contemplated by the E00 treat that it
would be ratiﬁed within 6 months. ow 18
months have elapsed and there is still no assurance
of early action, although good pro ress toward
ratiﬁcation has been made in severa of the E00
countries. No Parliament to which the E00
treaty has been submitted has voted against rati-
ﬁcation. But some of the Parliaments have not
wanted to face the issue.
None of us must underestimate the difﬁculty of
affirmative action. It involves a merging of na-
tional institutions which the nations identify with
their respective histories. It involves substitut-
ing fellowship for hatreds which are both ancient
and recent. However, the day of decision cannot
be indeﬁnitely postponed. We are close to a date
when nonaction is the equivalent of adverse ac-
tion. This is the more true because the Mutual

Security Act of 1953 conditions much of our
European military support upon the actual ex-
istence of Enc.‘
“The Deadly Danger of Pncrnatlnatlon"
General Eisenhower, in an address made in
London on July 3, 1951,“ made an appeal for
European unity which has rare] , if ever, been
equaled in its eloquence and in tie clarity of its
reasonin . After speakin of the immense gains
that cou d be achieved tirou h unity, General
Eisenhower pointed out that ‘the project faces
the deadly dan er of procrastination. . .
The negative is a wa s the easy side, since it holds
that nothing should7 be done. The negative is
happ in lethar , contemplating, almost with
comp acent satis action, the difiiculties of any
other course.”
Since he spoke, 21/2 years have gone by and the
truth of his observation has been manifest.
When I was in Paris last week, I mentioned the
importance of action soon, and said that if there
was not an early and afﬁrmative response, the
United States would have to undertake an “ago-
nizing reappraisal” of basic foreign policy in rela-
tion to Europe.
That statement, I thought, reﬂected a self-evi-
dent truth. Successive international communiques
issued throughout this year have said that the con-
summation of Eve was “urgent,” of “paramount
importance,” “necessary,” “needed” and “essen-
tia .” But these weighty utterances seem not to
have sunk in. Let me, therefore, mention three of
the factors which make Enc essential.
1. There is the immediate problem of the so-
called “forward strategy” in \Vestern Europe.
This means a plan, and a will, to defend the entire
area of the prospective Eoc countries rather than
to contemplate from the beginning the abandon-
ment of advanced positions in Germany, which
might make the rest untenable. In pursuance of
this strategy, a substantial part of the United
States Army occupies advanced positions in West
Germany. However, without the E00, it is not
legally permissible to draw on German strength
for the defense of German soil. Equally, of course.
it is not acceptable that the United States should
continue in the role of being a principal defender
of Germany, while the Germans themselves look
on as mere observers. The “forward strategy” was
initiated in September 1950 on the assumption
that there would soon be German participation in

‘The Richards amendment to the Mutual Security Act
of 1953 stipulates that. of the equipment and materials
made available for military assistance to Europe with
funds authorized for fiscal year 1954, 50 percent shall be
transferred to "the organization which may evolve from
current international discussions concerning a European
defense community" or “to the countries which become
members thereof."
