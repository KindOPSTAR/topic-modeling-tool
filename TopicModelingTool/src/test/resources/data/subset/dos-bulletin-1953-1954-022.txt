of this is done over the lon distance telephone.
Generally speaking your abinet members and
our Cabinet members are on intimate terms, and
as a consequence discuss many problems that arise
on an informal basis.
To an unusual de ee, the ri hts and obligations
of Americans in anada an Canadians in the
United States are not deﬁned by treaty. We
trust each other to treat our citizens properly.
Fair play is our common herita . In each coun-
try we have inherited the Eu lis common law, as
well as that Roman law whic is your legal foun-
dation here in the Province of Quebec and ours in
the State of Louisiana.
Nevertheless, with all this common heritage
which we are fortunate enough to share, there still
arise and will continue to arise important prob-
lems to plague us.
From time to time every government in the
performance of its obligation to remote the wel-
are of its people ﬁnds itself ob iged to take ac-
tions which have adverse eﬂ'ects upon some part
of the population of another country. Such inci-
dents arouse strong feelings, frequently out of
pro ortion to the importance of the issue.
ortunately, when we have been faced with such
situations, we have held that the best approach
was for honest representatives of our two coun-
tries to sit down together and to discuss the prob-
lem in a spirit of fairness and understanding. If
we continue to chart such a course, and I trust we
always will, there are few obstacles that cannot
be overcome.
You know, I am sure, the machinery that has
been established to deal with problems concernin
our boundary waters. It is the Internationa
Joint Commission of which both the United States
and Canada are justly proud. Another less well-
known exam le of this approach is the Joint In-
dustrial Mobilization Committee which was estab-
lished during World War II and revived in 1951
as a result of the Korean outbreak. This Com-
mittee was set up to stimulate joint production for
defense purposes.
Last month this same point of view led us to
establish the Joint Comm1ttee on Trade and Eco-
nomic Aﬂairs, a consultative and advisory ou
composed of Canadian and United States oébia s
at the Cabinet level.3 The businessmen of our two
countries are facing a highly competitive period.
In these circumstances, char s and counter-
charges, 'ustiﬁed and unjusti ed, are to be ex-
ted. he Committee will consider such prob-
ems among others and recommend to their
respective Governments the measures to improve
economic relations and to encourage the ﬂow of
trade between our two countries.
To make it practicable for our Governments to
implement such recommendations they must, of
course, be supported by public opinion. For, as
' lbid.. p. 739.
President Eisenhower honestly and frankly recog-
nized in his recent address to the two Houses of
Parliament in Ottawa,
. . every common undertaking, however worthwhile
it may be, must be understood in its origins. its applica-
tion, its effects by the peoples of our two countries. With-
out thls understanding it will have negligible chance of
success. Canadians and citizens of the United States do
not accept government by edict or decree. Informed and
intelligent cooperation is. for us, the only source of en-
during accomplishment.
Here I would like to give you a little philosophy
of my own which I developed from the ractical
ex eriences of my business and social li e.
f we businessmen are going to foster an orderly
economic evolution and assist in developing the
“informed and intelligent” public cooperation to
which President Eisenhower refers then some of
us_are going to have to contribute effective leader-
s l .
as must produce a philoso by that is under-
standable and convincing. e must have the
courage of our convictions and be able to express
them persuasive] .
This means alzitting sufﬁcient time out of our
workaday lives to decide what are the true values
in our daily activities and then determine to con-
centrate our efforts on their preservation.
None of us would choose exactly the same basis
of values or arrive at the same methods of achiev-
ing the desired ends, but that very contrast is the
real strength of our democracy. Differences in
opinion produce a balance, and when at last a com-
mon denominator appears in the thinking) of all
citizens, we move ahead. If a proper alance
is to be continued, the businessman must play an
im rtant art in the creation of opinion.
ften a change in individual responsibility ives
us a long look back at the road along wine 1 we
have traveled. Every well-managed business in-
stitution takes physical inventory at re lar in-
tervals, when every screw, nut, and lt are
counted. In the business that I was in before join-
ing the diplomatic service, every bushel of oats,
grain, wheat, barley and the various items that
go into making up our ﬁnished products, are
counted. We do this in order that we may know
our assets. The discrepancies which are uncov-
ered by this process are at times quite surprising.
Inventory ot lntanglhlos
Shouldn’t we do exactly the same thing with
our intangibles? It is essential that we take pe-
riodic inventories of our ideas and beliefs. This
is a process that must come from our hearts.
It is my belief that every man who carries busi-
ness responsibilities should from time to time sit
down alone with himself and determine what he
is trying to accomplish with his life. Unless he
does that, he will be unable to tell whether his
daily rushing from one thing to another adds up
