operation on the bases of equal rights and mutual advan-
tage. The Soviet Union is one of those States which are
striving toward the development of healthy trade and
which decisively condemn the policy which has discred-
ited itself in this ﬁeld of discrimination and pressure on
economically dependent countries. The interests of the
foreign policy of the Soviet Union do not demand the cre-
ation of military blocs and alliances directed against any
other states, nor does it demand the establishment of
military bases on the territory of other states. The
Soviet Union considers incompatible with normal rela-
lions between states the policy which would mean support
of diversionary subversive acts in other countries or
ﬁnancing of agents-saboteurs. Efforts to improve rela-
tions between states should have led to mutual recognition
of those principles which cannot contradict the national
interests of any state and which at the same time fully
accord with the interests of strengthening peace and inter-
national security.
Speciﬁcally for this reason the Soviet GoVernment con-
siders so important not only the forthcoming conference
in Berlin but also the conference of ﬁve powers with the
participation of the Chinese People’s Republic, since in
present circumstances only the Joint efforts of all great
powers together with the eﬂorts of other states can
assure the lessening of tension in the whole international
situation and appropriate solution of individual interna-
tional problems which have come to a head. This also
accords with the Charter of the United Nations under
which special responsibility for preserving the peace and
international security is laid on ﬁve states: the United
States of America, England, France, the U. S. S. R. and
China. In addition, it is completely evident that at the
present time speciﬁcally the Chinese People‘s Republic
should represent the great Chinese people in the United
Nations.
Wishing to assist in raising the role and authority of
the United Nations in strengthening universal peace, it
follows that one must display special pertinacity in bring-
ing together the positions of the ﬁve great powers on the
question of cutting short the race in atomic and all other
armaments. Any step toward agreement between these
powers both regarding the removal of the danger of the
use of atomic or hydrogen weapons and regarding the
cutting short of the armaments race in general would
undoubtedly be unanimously supported by all the United
Nations. Above all, there are present in this course im-
portant possibilities for lessening tension in the interna-
tional situation and for the strengthening of peace.
Having stated his opinion concerning the signiﬁcance of
atomic weapons. President Eisenhower spoke of the de-
sirability of holding appropriate confidential or diplomatic
conversations among interested states.
in addition, President Eisenhower advanced the pro-
posal that appropriate states should immediately begin to
transfer and in the future continue to transfer for the use
for peaceful purp0ses “from their stockpiles of normal
uranium and ﬁssionabie materials to an international
atomic energy agency" which would be under the auspices
of the United Nations. In this proposal, in addition, it is
indicated that this international atomic energy agency
“could be made responsible for the impounding, storage
and protection of the contributed ﬁssionable and other
material."
It is necessary to examine the signiﬁcance of this
proposal.
First, this proposal means that from existing and newly
created reserves of atomic materials it is proposed to allot
for peaceful purposes only a "certain" small part. From
this it follows that the principal mass of atomic materials
will as before be directed toward the production of new
atomic and hydrogen bombs and that there will remain
the full possibility of further stockpiling atomic weapons
and for the creation of new types of these weapons with
still greater destructive force. Consequently, this pro-
posal in its present form in no way ties the hands of the
states which can produce atomic and hydrogen weapons.
Secondly, the proposal of President Eisenhower in no
way limits the very possibility of using atomic weapons.
Acceptance of this proposal in no way limits an aggressor
in using atomic weapons for any purposes and at any time.
Consequently this proposal in no measure lessens the
danger of atomic attack.
Thus, one must conclude that in its present form the
proposal advanced by the United States neither stops the
growing production of atomic weapons nor limits the pos-
sibility of using these weapons. in evaluating the actual
signiﬁcance of the proposal in question, one cannot but
take this into account.
This proposal would have other signiﬁcance if it pro-
ceeded from the recognition of the necessity for the pro-
hibition of atomic weapons, which are weapons of aggres-
sion. But in the speech of the President of the United
States of America, there is no reference to the necessity
for the prohibition of atomic weapons. The question of
prohibiting atomic weapons is passed over in this speech
despite the fact that President Eisenhower emphasizes the
special danger of atomic Weapons which exists for the
peoples of the entire world in the present atomic age.
The question arises as to whether one can speak of the
necessity of lessening international tension and at the
same time pass over the problem of outlawing atomic
weapons. To this question, there cannot be two different
answers. All who are striving for the lessening of ten-
sion in international relations and for the strengthening
of peace cannot but demand that governments achieve the
most rapid and positive solution of this problem.
It is well known that the anxiety felt by peoples is
principally connected with the possibility of the outbreak
of atomic war, the danger of which it is impossible to
remove without the prohibition of atomic weapons. From
the very beginning of its existence this has been recog-
nized by the United Nations which has spoken of the neces-
sity of the prohibition of atomic weapons.
No one can deny the diﬁiculties involved in solving this
task. However, it cannot be said that the United Nations
and primarily those states particularly concerned have
made suﬂicient eﬂort to reach international agreement on
the question of prohibiting atomic weapons and establish-
ing effective international control for enforcing this pro-
hibition. Therefore, it would not be possible to explain
to mace-loving peoples a situation in which the solution of
this question was further delayed, or if this question were
passed by despite its extreme acuteness at this time.
That is why the Soviet Government, as before, considers
that the unconditional prohibition of atomic and hydrogen
weapons and other weapons of mass destruction as well
as simultaneous establishment of strict international
supervision over this prohibition is a most important and
urgent problem. All peace-loving peoples are interested
in the speediest solution of this problem.
If all this means that only a small part of atomic
material will be used for peaceful purposes but that the
principal mass of these materials, the quantity of which
is growing ceaselessly, will be used for the production of
increasingly destructive atomic weapons, then the danger
of atomic warfare is in no way lessened. This can serve
to weaken the people‘s vigilance with regard to the problem
of atomic weapons but cannot contribute to reduction of
the real danger of atomic warfare.
If an agreement between states means that only a cer-
tain small part of atomic materials is to be allocated for
peaceful purposes, while the production of atomic weap-
ons will continue to be limited by nothing, then such an
international agreement would, in fact, give direct ap-
proval to the production of atomic weapons. Interna-
tional approval of the production of atomic weapons
would well suit aggressive forces. Such a situation not
only would not make easier achievement of agreement on
prohibition of atomic weapons but, on the contrary, would
also be a new barrier to the achievement of the afore-
mentioned agreement.
Since we are striving to strengthen the peace, neither
the weakening of vigilance with regard to the danger of
atomic warfare nor international approval of production
of atomic weapons can have a place among our objectives.
