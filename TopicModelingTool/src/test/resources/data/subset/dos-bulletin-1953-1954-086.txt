Recognizing the seriousness of this mutual prob-
lem, the countries of the North American region,
namely, Canada, Cuba, the Dominican Republic
Haiti, Mexico, the United Kingdom (in respect of
the Bahamas and Jamaica), and the United States,
have in the past negotiated agreements designed
to harmonize the use of frequencies in the medium-
wave broadcasting bands. Two such agreements
have already expired by their terms of reference.
A third, which was negotiated more than 2 years
ago and was aligned by all of the countries con-
cerned except aiti and Mexico, has so far been
ratiﬁed only b Cuba. In view of the tremendous
investments 0 time and money in US. standard-
band broadcasting and of its far-reaching inﬂu-
ence as an information and advertisin medium,
the Department believes it highly des1rable that
this agreement be ratiﬁed. In the absence of such
an international instrument, the United States in-
evitably will be faced with difﬁculties having no
legal basis for settlement.
M for lnternetlenel Television
The tremendous strides made in the ﬁeld of tele-
vision during the period since World War II are
awesomely apparent, particularly in the United
States. The continuing expansion of this com-
munications medium again raises questions of an
international character. The Department has
long reco ized that the full potentialities of tele-
vision wi 1 be realized only with the development
of unhampered visual communication between
nations.
From a technical standpoint, present facilities
do not make feasible the Widespread international
exchange of televised information. During the
early stages of research and experimentation,
engineers in different countries proceeded inde-
pendent] of each other and as a result television
systems me established on varying technical
standards. The United Kingdom, for example,
employs a system producing an image of 405 lines;
France has two systems producing images of 441
and 819 lines; a number of other Western Euro-
pean countries use 625 lines; the United States and
a number of Western Hemisphere countries use
525 lines.
In spite of concerted attempts to formulate
recommendations for standards permitting the
international exchan of televismn pro ams,
economic and politica factors have preclu ed the
universal adoption of existing experimental and
publicly operating systems. It is unlikely that
complete uniformity will ever be achieved, al-
though recent ﬁndin and studies show promise
of methods by whic television signals may be
converted for rebroadcast between countries with
diﬁering technical standards. The 525-line and
the 625-line systems have a compatibility feature
not present in other systems which makes possible
the reception of signals from either of the two
systems. Through minor receiver ad'ustments, the
programs of countries employing di erent systems
may thus become available to audiences near in-
ternational boundaries. It is the policy of the
United States to encourage the development of
compatible television systems not only in the
Western Hemisphere, where pro ess is en-
couraging, but among all nations in order that
audiences everywhere may someday have access to
this extraordinary instrument for understanding
between peoples.
Past prophecies in the communications ﬁeld have
been exceeded many times, and it is increasingly
diﬁicult to keep pace with the march of technical
advancement. 'I he ﬂowering of radio techniques
has been accompanied by equally impressive de-
velopments in other sectors of the electronics in-
dustry. The telephone and ocean cable systems of
the world have achieved an enviable record of de-
pendable service, and it is anticipated that their
role will continue to increase in importance. The
tremendous accretion of communications facilities
brought about by radio has not sufficed to accom-
modate the still greater increase in the need for
communications and electronic devices.
A growing number of experts close to the prob-
lem of 1‘8le frequency management have con-
cluded that the time will come when communica-
tions between ﬁxed points of transmission and
reception will be carried by wire and cable
wherever possible. Through augmented cable
facilities it is not unlikely that the tele )hone sub-
scriber of the future will be heard by his counter-
part in London, Paris, or beyond as clearly and
conveniently as local callers are heard today. The
telegraph sender, already efﬁciently accommo-
dated, will become the beneﬁciary of further tech-
nological improvements. The communications in-
dustry relies u on government for the furtherance
of its aims. rough the coordination of overall
US. interests at home and the promotion of those
interests abroad, the De artment of State makes
its own contribution to t e progressive expansion
of world telecommunications facilities. '
