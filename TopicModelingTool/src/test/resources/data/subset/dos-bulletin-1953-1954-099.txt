committee which held heari on the Palestine
refugee problem the followmg statement was
made:
American aid cannot continue indeﬁnitely. In fact the
subcommittee is of the opinion that unless considerably
more progress is shown in the near future than has been
shown up to this time, the Congress would not be justl-
ﬂed in continuing aid for this program through the United
Nations.
The American people are moved by strong humanitarian
motives, but they cannot be expected to bear indeﬁnitely
so large a share of the burden involved in this situation
when Israel and the Arab States show so little initiative
in helping to settle the matter among themselves. There
is a very real danger that the longer the United States
continues to supply relief money, the less desire there
will be on the part of the states in this area to make real
efforts on their own to liquidate the problem.
These sentiments were reﬂected in the statement of
Congressman James P. Richards, of the United
States Delegation to the United Nations, when the
question of continuation of UNRWA was under
consideration by the General Assembly, in No-
vember 1953.‘
VIII. The Political Aspects ol the Arab Refugee
Problem
The unresolved problems of the Arab refugees
are the result of the determined disagreement be-
tween the Arab States and the States of Israel.
Brieﬂy, it can best be presented by stating the
relative positions of the arties involved, as stated
to the Commission: ( 1) he Arab States; (2) Is-
rael, and (3) the refugees.
(1) The Arab States. The Arab attitude is
basically that Palestine is an area inhabited by
Palestinian Arabs for centuries and that they are,
therefore, legally and morally entitled to the lands
from which the refugees ﬂed as a result of hostili-
ties in 1947—48. Arab leaders reject the claims of
the Israeli Government that there is any other
outstanding legal or moral claim to Palestinian
lands. They have pointed out that a Jewish state,
as such, existed for only 150 years in the 4,000
years of the recorded history of Palestine. They
regard the circumstances of ﬂight by the refugees
to be the direct result of premeditated aggression
and terror by organized Israeli groups. They cul-
minated in fear-invoking incidents designed solely
for the purpose of creatm fear among the Pales-
tinian rabs so as to ma e them abandon their
homes and lands.
The Arabs contend that it was only for these
reasons that the Palestinian Arabs left their homes
and became unwilling refugees in neighboring
Arab States. These Arab States gave them refuge
and aid to the extent of their ability, but under no
circumstances did they assume moral or legal re-
sponsibility for them as their kin. Their only

relationship is one of common language. Their
predominant Moslem faith is one which the Arab
States share with 350 million Moslems in other
countries from the Philip ines to Spain to whom
they owe no moral or egal responsibility for
their well-being. The Arabs insist that simple
justice requires the recognition of the right of
the refugees to return to their homes and lands,
or if they do not elect to return to Palestine, that
they should be compensated for the loss of their
property. They repeatedly point to the recog-
nition of this principle by the United Nations
contained in its Resolution of December 11, 1948.
The Arab States basically fear, and often re eat,
that Israel’s motives are to further ex an its
territory, by force or other devices. T erefore,
any peace settlement would be only an interlude
before hostilities would be resumed to accomplish
these ends. The Arabs contend that the United
States, the United Kingdom, and the United
Nations are principally responsible for the cre-
ation of the State of Israel and, therefore, are
bound to ﬁnd the solution to the refugee problem.
(2) Israel. The attitude of Israeli leaders is
basically that there are historical and moral rights
to their homelands in Palestine which date back
to Biblical times. Also it is a fulﬁllment of their
religious obligation to re-establish a Jewish State.
It is contended that this is “rightin an historical
wrong”. This rinci le, they hol , was recog-
nized in the Ba four eclaration of 1917. They
point to the mi ation of their people during the
riod of the %ritish Mandate in which they
egally and roperly obtained claims to land, in
addition to t at owned by the Levantine Jewish
people who had lived there for centuries. They
regard the hostilities of 1948 as being acts of
Arab aggression and Iipint to the Arab refusal to
accept the Partition lan. They also maintain
that when the Palestinian Arabs ﬂed into neigh-
borin Arab countries they did so of their own
accor at the urging of Arab leaders. Moreover,
these areas have since been settled and built up
by their people, and as such they have established
a ri ht to the lands.
A though the Israeli Government recognizes
the principle of compensation for lands owned by
the Arabs, it regards this as a matter to be dealt
with in a general peace settlement. Repeatedly
they point to the fact that since 1948, in addition
to 350,000 refugees from Eurgpe, the have re-
settled over 300,000 Jewish re u es from Arab
and Moslem countries, principa ly from Iraq,
Yemen and North Africa. Because they are ac-
tive in the integration of these Jewish refugees
they consider the Arabs should show a similar
concern for the integration of Palestinian refu-
gees into Arab countries.
The Israeli Government takes determined ex-
ception to the policy of the Arab States in im-
posing and maintaining an economic blockade of
Israel apparently for the purpose of forcing them
