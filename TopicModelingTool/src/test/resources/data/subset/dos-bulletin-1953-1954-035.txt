was to assure a more efﬁcient administration of the eco-
nomic assistance being extended to the Republic of Korea
by the member nations of! the United Nations through the
Uniﬁed Command. In activating the Korea Civil As-
sistance Command under the direct control of Headquar-
ters, United Nations Command, two intervening command
echelons were eliminated. The Korea Civil Assistance
Command will administer all phases of! civil assistance
rendered by the United Nations Command to the Republic
of Korea including formulation of programs for relief and
support of the civilian population, distribution of relief
supplies and carrying out projects of reconstruction and
rehabilitation which are not undertaken by the United
Nations Korean Reconstruction Agency.
SEVENTY-THIRO REPORT: FOR THE PERIOD
JULY 1—15, 1953 '
U.N. doc. 8/3133
Dated November 2, 1953
[Excerpts]
I herewith submit report number 73 of the United
Nations Command Operations in Korea for the period
1—15 July 1953, inclusive. United Nations Command com-
muniques numbers 1662—1676 provide detailed accounts of
these operations.
There Were no Armistice meetings during the first seven
days of July. Meetings of liaison ofﬁcers resumed on
8 July and on 9 July a liaison ofﬁcers meeting was called
by the United Nations Command. A meeting of the plenary
session was scheduled for 1100 on 10 July.
The Senior Delegates met in executive session through-
out the remainder of the period.
During the period from 10 July to 15 July the Commu-
nist Delegates asked the United Nations Command Dele-
gates questions relating to the implementation of the
Armistice Agreement. Meetings during this period were
in executive session. Communist questions mainly per-
tained to the action the United Nations Command would
take in the event that the Republic of Korea Armed Forces
do not abide by the terms of the Armistice Agreement.
The question of what the term, “post-hostilities period”
meant was introduced into the discussions. The United
Nations Command stated that this term includes the entire
period of the Armistice and that there is no time limit
to the Armistice.
The United Nations Command pointed out that the
Armistice being negotiated was a military Armistice be-
tween opposing commanders and that the United Nations
Command had clearly and unequivocally stated to the
Communists that it is prepared to enter into and abide
by all provisions of that Armistice Agreement including
Article 62.
Despite unilateral Communist violations of the agree-
ment on executive sessions, United Nations Command
radio broadcasts and leaﬂets continued to confine their
armistice reports to officially authorized information.
Extensive coverage was given. in broadcasts audible
throughout Korea, to the tireless efforts of the United
Nations and United Nations Command agencies in relief
and rehabilitation in Korea. Official statements were
broadcast, reiterating the determination of the United
Nations to continue working for unification of Korea
through peaceful means.

Progress Toward Evacuation of
Foreign Forces From Burma
Statements by Archibald J. Carey, Jr.
U .S. Representative to the General Assembly“
U.S. delegation press release dated November 27
As the members of this committee know, the
debate on the question before us was adjourned on
November 5 in order that our further considera-
tion of the matter might be taken in the li ht of
what has been and what is being accomplis ed to
implement the proposed evacuation of some 2,000
foreign forces from Burma.
We have recently received several progress re-
orts1° from the Joint Committee in Bangkok.
hese reports have been circulated in this com-
mittee, and they give many statistics which you
will probably wish to digest for yourselves. I do
not intend to review them in detail at this moment,
but I do wish to underscore the salient points for
comment.
As of today, November 27, 1,103 were troops,
including 33 women listed as doctors and nurses.

'Made on Nov. 27 and Dec. 4 in Committee I (Political
and Security). For previous statements, see BULLETIN of
Nov. 30, 1953, p. 761.

dated Nov. 27.
The remaining 175 are de endents. Practically
all of these individuals with the exception of one
hospital case have been airlifted to Formosa. In
two more days, on November 29, additional evac-
uees are expected, and on that day an estimated
150 individuals are due to arrive at the border.
Further groups estimated at from 100 to 150 evac-
uees are anticipated at the border on December 2,
December 4, December 6, and December 8, accord-
ing to the tentative evacuation schedule presented
to the Joint Committee by the foreign forces rep-
resentative at Mae Chan. To summarize, then,
nearly 1,300 individuals, of whom more than 1,100
are troops, have already been evacuated and with-
in the next 10 days or so, additional numbers es-
timated at between 550 to 750 are expected to be
evacuated.
As you will observe from the Joint Committee’s
basic report, which is before you, the majority of
the evacuees have been in good hysical condition
and on] about 2 percent of t em were medical
cases. gixt percent were between the ages of 20
and 40, an 12 ercent were between 15 and 19
years of age. ou will also observe from the re—
port before you the high percentage of ofﬁcers, in-
cluding enerals, colonels, lieutenant colonels, ma-
jors, and; so on down in rank.
There have, of course, been delays in the evacua-
tion. Some of them have been unavoidable. Fly-
ing weather, for example, caused the loss of 3
days. Other delays were caused by a dispute over
