International Bank Loans
Made in Brazil
The International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development on December 18 made two loans in
Brazil totaling $22.5 million.
The ﬁrst is a loan of $12.5 million to the Gov-
ernment of Brazil. It will be used primarily to
meet part of the cost of importing passenger train
units urgently required to maintain the suburban
service of the Central do Brasil Railroad in Rio
de J aneiro.
The second is a loan of $10 million to the Usinas
Elétricas do Paranapanema S. A. (USINAS), a
corporation owned almost entirely by the State of
S510 Paulo. This loan is guaranteed by the Bra-
zilian Government. It will be used to pay for
imported equipment for the construction of a hy-
droelectric plant at Salto Grande on the Parana-
panema River in the State of S50 Paulo and asso-
ciated transmission and distribution facilities in
the States of S50 Paulo and Parana. The power
will serve rapidly growing agricultural and urban
centers and will help electrify the Sorocabana
Railroad, one of the state’s im ortant railways.
The railway loan of $12.5 mil ion is the second
the bank has made for an emergency program
to rehabilitate and improve the serv1ces 0? the
Central do Brasil Railroad. This railroad con-
nects Brazil’s major industrial centers. A loan
of $12.5 million was made in June 1952 to cover
the Central’s immediate needs for freight cars and
other equipment to increase the carrying capacity
of the railroad. At that time the bank indicated
that it would be prepared to consider an additional
loan for the suburban service as soon as effective
steps were taken to improve administration and
0 rating conditions on the suburban lines.
ese steps have since been taken.
The proi'lect for the development of electric
power in t e State of S50 Paulo consists of the
construction of a dam across the Paranapanema
River at Salto Grands, the installation of four
15,000 kilowatt generating units, the erection of a
transmission system, and the expansion of the dis-
tribution systems of ﬁve private utilit companies
which will purchase power generate at the new
plant. The bank’s loan will be used to ay for
the import of turbines, generators, trans ormers,
transmission lines, and other equipment and ma-
terials.
The Salto Grande project is the ﬁrst step in the
development of the ower potential of the Para-
napanema River, w ich is situated in an area
devoted primarily to the raisin of coffee. New
wealth from coffee has brought a out immi ation
from other parts of the state and the rapi devel-
opment of urban centers. The privately owned
utilities serving these communities are at present
unable to keep up with the demand for power
but will be able to do so when they can obtain
power wholesale from Salto Grande and distribute
it over their extended systems.
