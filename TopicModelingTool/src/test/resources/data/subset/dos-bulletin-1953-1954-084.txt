but to assume active and energetic leadership in
all phases of international telecommunications
activities.
For a number of years the Department of State
was concerned primarily with the legal aspects of
telecommunications arising as a consequence of
this country’s participation in a number of con-
ventions and agreements and, eventually, its mem-
bership in the International Telecommunication
Union. Accordingly, the related Departmental
functions were assl ed to the Treaty Division in
1935. By 1938 the increasing complexity of prob-
lems having both political and economic implica-
tions led to the incorporation of telecommunica-
tions responsibilities in the newly created Division
of International Communications. In the face of
war-occasioned burdens and the rospect of their
continuation in the postwar perio , further adj ust-
ments were made with the establishment of the
Oﬂice of Trans ort and Communications in Janu-
ary 1944, at w ich time the Telecommunications
Division, now the Telecommunications Policy
Staff, was created.
It is the objective of the Department to achieve
a. telecommunications olicy which parallels the
litical and economic fbreign policy of the United
tates with the speciﬁc aim of insuring that the
Government, private organizations, and citizens
are afforded the opportunity to compete on an
equitable basis for the use of available communica-
tions facilities in order that each may receive the
maximum beneﬁts consistent with a fair return for
services rendered. This concept involves negotia-
tions for the establishment and regulation of fa-
cilities which will most effectively serve and
rotect the communications interest of the United
tates; opposition to discriminatory practices in
this ﬁeld wherever they may arise; and the advo-
cacy of low, uniform rates which will provide
adequate revenue to the private 0 eratin com-
pames. The Telecommunications olicy tail’ is
re onsible for the initiation and coordination of
po icy activities which will achieve these objec-
tives in coordination with the Federal Communi-
cations Commission, the Department of Defense,
and other de artments and agencies concerned.
’ The Ohio of the Telecommunications Policy
Staff represents the United States on the Admin-
istrative Council of the International Telecom-
munication Union. In the fulﬁllment of other
responsibilities the Staff is represented on nu-
merous interdepartmental committees. The Tele-
communications Coordinating Committee, for
example, was established in 1946, principally to
advise the Department of State on problems of
international telecommunications policy. It acts
only in an advisory capacity but can take ﬁnal
action when speciﬁcally authorized by unanimous
concurrence of all government agencies repre-
sented by its membership. Its chairman is the
Director of the Office of Transport and Com-
munications, and its members include representa-
tives from the Departments of the Treasury,
Army, Navy, Air Force, and Commerce, and the
Federal Communications Commission, and an
observer from the Bureau of the Budget.
One of the oldest of the U.S. telecommunica-
tions coordinating mechanisms is the Interdepart-
mental Radio Advisory Committee (IRAQ) which
was created in 1922. Under law the President is
res onsible for assigning radio frequencies for use
by EU.S. Government stations. Such assignments
are accomplished periodically through the instru-
ment of Executive orders. In actual practice, the
IRAC, as a Presidential advisory agency, may be
said to assign frequencies to government radio
stations, thus paralleling the similar function per-
formed by the Federal Communications Commis-
sion in relation to nongovernment stations. In
addition to its frequency assignment functions,
the IRAC furnishes advice and assistance to the
President and the Federal agencies on various
technical matters of interagency interest. One of
its current major activities relates to plans for
the frequency-band clearance and frequency shifts
required to im lement the frequency-allocation
tablre in the At antic City Radio Regulations of
194 .
International Allocation of Frequencies
This allocation plan grew out of intensive ef-
forts b the members of the ITU in recognition of
the ser1ous need for a greatly expanded allocation
table. Differing little in its fundamentals from
previous plans, it nonetheless accomplished the
tremendous task of scientiﬁcall allocating fre-
quency bands to all existing rad1o services. Par-
ticular provision was made for additional exclu-
sive frequency bands for the international broad-
casting and aeronautical services. Having spent
more than 4 months in the development of the
allocation table, the conferees were unable to ro-
ceed to the next stage, the implementation 0 the
table through assi ment of speciﬁc frequencies
to the hundreds 0 stations to be accommodated
within the broad allocations by services. Instead,
the conference created a tem orar body known
as the Provisional Frequency gourd"Y (PFB) for the
purpose of formulating an international fre uency
list which would attempt to provide for the egiti-
mate needs of all countries on the basis of sound
engineering principles.‘ It was intended that as
many countries as possible be represented on this
Board, which commenced work in Geneva in J anu-
ary 1948. The United States was represented by
a arge delegation of engineers from government
and private industry.
In view of the size and complexity of the prob-
lem, it had been further provided that frequency
lists for certain bands should be prepared by spe-
cial conferences convened for that purpose. Thus,
