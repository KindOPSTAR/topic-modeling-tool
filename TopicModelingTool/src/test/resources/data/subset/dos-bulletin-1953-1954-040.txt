China In the Shadow of Communlsm
by Walter P. McComughy
How have we come so abruptly to the present
sad and menacing state of ail'airs in China when
the National Government was victorious and
clothed with great international prestige in 1945?
A strong contributory factor undoubtedly was
the tragically devitalizing effect on China of a
decade and a half of struggle against Japanese
aggression.
Many observers were not unaware of the de-
bilitating effects of Ja anese encroachment, but
few appreciated to the till the extent to which the
Chinese governmental, economic, and social struc-
ture had been undermined. The collapse on the
mainland in 1948 and 1949 was in substantial
measure the evil fruit of that bitter and heroic
earl struggle.
\\ e cannot seriously believe that the ultimate
judgment of history will hold our country ri-
marily responsible for the debacle which took plilce
in China between 1945 and 19-19, the consequences
of which no man can foretell.
Our help before and during those ears was
very substantial, even though it prove to be in-
effective. v'In a sense the defeat re resented a
failure of free men, primarily in China, but see-
ondarily in every associated country that was free,
to recognize to the full the sinister nature of the
threat, which far transcended the borders of
China, and a corollary failure to respond with the
prodigious measure of sacriﬁcial eﬂ'ort that would
ave been required to forestall the catastrophe.
Support ol Government on Formosa
Today we see the government which was the
victim of that Communist conspiracy and aggres-
sion entrenched on Formosa, endowed with a
rent sense of dedication and a clear understand-
ing of the nature of the enemy, as a result of the
ﬁres through which it has used. Much of the
dross has been con: umed in t e searing experiences
of these years.
Aided by military and economic programs in
which we are participating heavily, it stands lit-
erally and ﬁguratively as a rallying point for all
Chinese who oppose the Communist oligarchy
which aims to keep the Chinese people in bondage
and use them for the further attainment of their
evil ob'ectives. The Chinese Government and its
{Wop e Formosa are redoubtable members of
the confraternity of free peo les who are ready
to take their stand against rther Communist
conquests.
In view of the limitations imposed by relatively
small geographic, manpower and economic re-
sources, care must be taken not to overestimate
that government’s material capabilities. The
strongest force they can master and sup rt is
none too large for the threat they face. it the
no less important moral and psychological spheres
their value to the common cause is enormous.
We have our problems with that government
as it no doubt has its problems with ours. Gov-
ernments are fallible, as are the humans who com-
pose them. The point is that this government is
essentially with us. It is a government with
which we can negotiate on a rational plane. We
arle dealing with it on a sane basis of give and
ta 1!.
- We are rendering substantial help to this gov-
ernment without intervening in its domestic af-
fairs or otherwise infringing on its sovereignty.
We are helping a beleaguered people to help them-
selves and the common cause. It is a program
from which we can derive some satisfaction. It
is our nurpose to continue to back this government.
_We believe that it is the only Chinese Govern-
ment which represents in any measure the authen-
tic as irations and the bona ﬁde national inter-
ests o the Chinese peo 1e.
Disillusioned thoughJ the mass of the Chinese
may have been with it in the dark days of 1948—49
its record on Formosa makes it look better an
better to the Chinese people on the mainland by
contrast with the ruthless exploitation which they
are sufferin at the hands of the regime of Mao
Tse-tung. here is reason to hope that the gov-
ernment at Taipei will continue to grow in
