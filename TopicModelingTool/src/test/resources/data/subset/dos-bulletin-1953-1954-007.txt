economic aid to the countries of Western Europe.
These countries have made a good economic re-
covery. Their currencies are showing greater
strength and stability. The inﬂationary pressures
are reduced, as a result of sounder ﬁscal and mone-
tary policies. There is also some progress toward
greater economic freedom and liberalization of
trade, though there continue to be serious restric-
tions on the movement of goods, and especially
on the import of dollar goods.
These NA'ro meetings, along with the activities
of other international groups, are spreading an
understanding of the requirements for economic
strength, which is basic to the political and mili-
tary strength of the West.
The Deterrent ot Captlves’ Dlscontent
It is important to bear in mind that while mili-
tary power is a principal deterrent to armed
a gression, it can be importantl reinforced by
ot er deterrents. For example, t e Soviet rulers
may hesitate to attack if contrasting social condi-
tions brin them domestic troubles.
At our aris meeting it was generally judged
by the NATO Ministers that the danger of 0 en
military aggression from Soviet Russia was ess
than it had been a year or two before. That, if
true, is largely due to NA'ro’s growing power. But
also it is due to internal pressures and discontents
resultin from the bad living conditions within the
Soviet b 00 and the contrasting better conditions
within the neighboring free countries.
It seems that the Soviet rulers’ exploitation of
their own and the satellite peoples has reached
a point where it would be reckless for them to
engage in sgeneral war. All recent major speeches
by high oviet ofﬁcials seek to encourage their
people to hope for more food and more consumers’
goods of better quality. That clearly shows a
opular demand so insistent that it cannot be
ignored. It suggests that perhaps the workers
within the Soviet Union may be allowed to work
less for military purposes and more for their own
good. That, of course, would be a welcome ap-
proach to the practices observed in the free world.
The revolt of last June within East German
exposed the vast underlying discontent whic
exists among the workers within the satellite areas.
It indicates that if there were an armed invasion of
Western Europe, the Soviet lines of communica-
tion might not be altogether secure.
These were among the factors which, the For-
eign Ministers at Paris felt, operated to deter an
invasion of Western Europe. It shows how im-
portant it is for the free world countries to con-
tinue to provide living standards really superior to
those within the captive world.
I am not suggesting that an orgy of self-
indulgenoe is the answer to the Soviet menace.
The danger is immense and persistent. This is no
time for the free world to relax and to weaken its
own military capacity to defend and strike back.
We are, however, at a time when we can usefully
confront Soviet rulers with a demonstration of our
capacity to do two things at once—i. e., to develop
military power and to increase well-being.
I said to the NATO Council—
We are convinced that our members can provide the
resources for an adequate defense, including a wide range
of new weapons, and at the same time permit a steady
improvement in the living standards and general welfare
of our peoples. . . . That itself is a security measure.
It nulliﬂes the Communists' subversive efforts against the
free governments. Also, it creates a striking contrast to
despotism, and thus confronts the Soviet rulers with a
dilemma at home.
\Ve gave consideration to the problem of the de-
fense of the North American Continent. Canada
and the United States form part of the treaty area
and the Council recognizes that it is important
to protect North America’s military potential.
The temptation to aggression would be great if the
ag essor could, by an initial blow, knock out the
in ustrial power of North America.
It is not feasible to rovide an absolute insur-
ance against serious amage to our cities and
industries. However, it is possible to secure a
substantial measure of protection.
The Foreign Minister of Canada 'oined with us
in emphasizing the importance to NATO of defen-
sive measures within this continent. But we both
indicated that this would not be sought at a scale
of expense which would impair the ability of our
countries to contribute to other aspects of the
NATO effort.
We were greatly im ressed by the spirit of vig-
orous fellowship whicii pervades NATO. The per-
manent NATO staﬁ', drawn from 14 countries, is
dedicated to a common purpose. That is an in-
spiring fact. Indeed, NATO is a unique organiza-
tion in more respects than one. Never before have
sovereign nations so freely exchanged military
information. Never before have nations taken
recommendations from an international body con-
cernin length of military service, balance of
forces iietween military services, and other equally
delicate problems and, what is even more surpris-
ing, accepted them in spite of adverse domestic
political considerations.
The American people can take pride in NATO
and take comfort in it. \Ve should sustain it on
the basis now planned—a basis which involves a
fair sharing of burdens and beneﬁts, and which
combines growing strength for NATO with eco-
nomic and ﬁscal integrity for ourselves and other
member countries.
Certainly, each member of NATO gets out of it
much more than the price of admission. It is
costly, but it is not nearly as costly as though each
tried to buy separately, for itself alone, the amount
of security that it now gets on a collective basis.
Indeed, no nation, at any cost, could get alone what
NATO provides for all its members.
