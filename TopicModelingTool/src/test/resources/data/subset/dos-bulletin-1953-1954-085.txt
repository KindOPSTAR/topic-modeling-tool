two conferences were held in 1949 and 1950 to
repare a frequency assignment plan for high-
requency broadcasting stations. During 1948 and
1949 conferences convened in Switzerland to de-
velop an aeronautical radio-frequency plan. In
addition, efforts were made to reach agreement on
frequency assignment plans for the several regions
of the world. Of these various conferences only
the Aeronautical Administrative Conferences
were entirely successful in achieving satisfactory
agreements.
The original concept had been that the fre-
quenc lists resulting rom the special conferences
woul be incorporated with the master list pre-
Eared by the Provisional Frequency Board for
nal approval by an Extraordinary Administra-
tive Radio Conference which would also establish
the date when the Atlantic City frequency alloca-
tions would take eﬂ'ect. Unfortunately this con-
cept could not be realized. The task assigned to
the Provisional Frequency Board was much more
complex than had been envisaged at Atlantic City,
largely as a consequence of the narrower fre-
quency bands allotted to the ﬁxed services under
the Atlantic City Table. In general the countries
of the world submitted frequency requirements far
in excess of their actual or foreseeable needs and
well beyond the capacity of the frequency spec-
trum to accommodate the desired services. Fur-
thermore, the work of the Pra was carried out in
a period of increasingly disturbed world condi-
tions accompanied by a diminution of sincere co-
operative effort. As a result the Extraordinary
Administrative Radio Conference scheduled to
convene at The Hague in 1950 was postponed.
Subsequently, however, a resolution of the ITU
Administrative Council proposing that. the con-
ference meet at Geneva in August 1951 was over-
whelmingly approved by the Union’s member-
ship. The conference was convened as scheduled
and the resulting agreement was signed on
December 3, 1951.
Results of Geneva Conference
Although the PM; had been unable to produce
an acceptable master frequency list, it made signif-
icant contributions to further progress. Throu h
its efforts the obstacles to implementation of t e
Atlantic City plan were more clearly deﬁned, and
an enormous amount of data was collected with
respect to the actual use of frequencies. The im-
practicability of devising an overall assi ment
plan had been demonstrated, and the eneva
Conference faced the task of bringing about the
desired implementation of allocations by other
means. _
A possible solution lay in the practical expedient
of a gradual implementation based on actual fre-
quency usage and without reference to ﬁnal dates
for the completion of this process. Being less
crowded, that portion of the spectrum above 27.5
megacycles presented no great problem. The
previously adopted plan for the shifting of the
aeronautical mobile services into their allotted
bands was available for implementation. Similar
accord was reached at the Geneva Conference on a
method for transfer of the Maritime Mobile
Services into their Atlantic City bands. It was
envisaged that, through the evolutionary process
of such partial realinements, the ﬁxed, land-
mobile, and tropical broadcasting services over
a period of time would have no alternative but to
conform to their proper allocations, and such has
been the encouraging tendency in actual practice.
As the agreed plans have taken effect the gradual
occupancy of frequencies previously used by other
services has in turn caused the latter to seek fre-
quencies within their allotted bands. It was also
agreed to emplo the gradual adjustment pro-
cedure for high- requenc broadcasting stations,
and the International requency Registration
Board was instructed to prepare an International
HF Broadcasting Fr uenc List on the basis of
pre-engineeredplans ta ing into account the actual
requirements 0 all countries.
A further decision was reached that the 1955
session of the Administrative Council should re-
view reports repared by the Iran on the progress
made under t e gradual adjustment process for the
ﬁxed, land-mobile, and tro ical broadcasting sta-
tions and the plans made For the high-frequency
broadcasting stations to determine whether or not
a deﬁnite date could then be established for bring-
ing the Atlantic City Table into force. If so, the.
Administrative Council would make its recom-
mendation to the ITU membershi for its ap-
proval. If not, it would consider Similar reports
from the Inn; at each subsequent session of the
Council until it became practical to establish such
a date.
In the meantime remarkable progress has been
achieved. The United States, having exercised
its leadership in the authorship and activation of
plans for the orderly sharing of radio frequencies
among the nations of the world, must meet its own
obligations to conform with those plans. Alread
more than 50 percent of the changes affecting U. .
services as a result of the EARC agreement have
been implemented, and this trend may be expected
to continue.
Such advances, though impressive, represent
but a small segment’s interest in the furtherance
of US. telecommunications objectives. In the
ﬁeld of radio alone the problems are extremely di-
verse. There are, for example, more than 2,500
broadcasting stations in the United States. Al-
though it is possible to minimize domestic problems
of interference between those stations through the
regulatory activities of the Federal Communica-
tions Commission, international agreements are
necessary to provide the same degree of protection
between broadcasting stations in neighboring
countries.
