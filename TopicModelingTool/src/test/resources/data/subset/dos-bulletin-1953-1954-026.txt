United States Senate on July 9, 1953, and ratiﬁed
by the President on behalf of the United States
on July 23.
The provisions of the conventions follow, in
neral, the pattern of tax conventions entered
into by the United States with a number of other
countries. The income-tax conventions are de-
signed to remove an undesirable impediment to
international trade and economic develo ment by
doing away as far as possible with dou le taxa-
tion on the same income.
The gift-tax convention with Australia is the
ﬁrst convention of its kind which the United
States has concluded with any country. It follows
closely in regard to 'fts the pattern of the estate-
tax conventions. T e estate-tax conventions are
designed to eliminate double taxation in connec-
tion with the settlement in one country of estates
in which nationals of the other country have
interests.
So far as the United States is concerned, the con-
ventions ap ly only with respect to United States
(that is, Fe eral) taxes. They do not apply to the
imposition of taxes by the several States, the Dis-
trict of Columbia, or the Territories or possessions
of the United States.
The income-tax convention with Australia is ef-
fective as of January 1, 1953. so far as United
States tax is concerned, and “for the year of in-
come” commencing on July 1, 1953, so far as
Australian tax is concerned.
The exchange of instruments of ratiﬁcation with
respect to the estate-tax convention has been de-
la ed, but it is expected that the exchange will
e place at an early date, on which date it will
enter into force, effective “only as to the estates of
persons d ing on or after” that date.
The gi t-tax convention with Australia is effec-
tive “only as to gifts made on or after” December
14, 1953, the date of the exchange of instruments
of ratiﬁcation.
U.S. To Reconsider
Ocean Station Participation
Press release 669 dated December 22
The following is the text of a letter which the
United States re resentative on the Council of
the Internationa Civil Aviation Organization
(Icao transmitted on December 22 to the Secre-
tary eneral of the Organization. The De art-
ment of State requested transmission of the etter
following approval by the interdepartmental Air
Coordinating Committee.
Following the Third North Atlantic Ocean Stations Con-
ference. my Government undertook a review of the pro-
gram in all its aspects, with particular reference to the
nature and extent of beneﬁts derived therefrom by the
United States. It was our conclusion that, although the
program provided real beneﬁt, its continued operation was
not required from the point of view of United States civil
aviation. Our decision not to extend United States par-
ticipation in the existing agreement was made known to
the Council and to interested governments in October.‘
Since that time, and in preparing for the forthcoming
conference, my Government has kept this mutter under
continuous review. In that connection the United States
has noted with interest the views of other governments
submitted to low on the same subject. We have been
impressed by certain trends of thought which appear in
these comments.
1. That an ocean stations network should continue to
exist;
2. That such a network might be somewhat reduced in
scope and still remain useful;
3. That substantial beneﬁts accrue to interests other than
trans-Atlantic civil aviation, particularly in Western
Europe.
In view of the foregoing, it seems probable that any con-
tinuation ot' the ocean station program would be most
effective on a basis of international cooperation.
Accordingly, my Government has decided to send a dele-
gation to the Fourth North Atlantic Ocean Stations Con-
ference in Paris. qualiﬁed to discuss all of the technical
and financial aspects of the program. An exchange of
views at the Conference will permit a determination as to
whether. as seems likely, a continuation of an interna-
tional ocean station program on a modiﬁed basis is the
best means of satisfying all of the interests involved. If
such a determination is reached the United States would
expect to cooperate in a modiﬁed program. subject to the
availability of necessary appropriations which it would
seek to meet its appropriate share of the costs.
