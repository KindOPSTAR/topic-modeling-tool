strength, in devotion to the cardinal principles of
democracy, and in international prestige, and that
its base of free Chinese support will steadily be
broadened so that it will be enabled to raise ever
higher a standard around which all Chinese may
rally who wish to save from extinction Chinese
freedoms and the ancient and distinctive Chinese
traditions.
We ﬁnd an element of irrationality in much of
the vituperation heaped upon that government
and its head. Grant that it committed errors of
'udgment after World War II; concede that it
ad in large measure lost the conﬁdence of the
Chinese people when it abandoned the mainland
4 years ago; after all that is taken into account we
have still the incontrovertible fact that it has stood
steadfastly by those princi les which free people
recognize as aramount. t has come a long way
since it estab ished itself on Formosa.
It seems to us that the intemperate abuse heaped
on the Chinese Government is often based on petty
rsonal grounds or on shortcomings which are no
onger re evant.
There is an occasional form of human perverse-
ness which tends to cause displeasure to rise higher
against a man of good will who is in diﬁiculty in-
volving others than against a dangerous public
enemy with whom there has been no personal con-
tact. But this reaction should be momentary at
the most.
If there was ever any excuse for overlookin
the faults of the enemy and ma ifying the allege
faults of the friend, 1t abrupt y ended in Novem-
ber 1950 when the Chinese Communists without
warnin or warrant hurled their forces against
the U. . defenders of Korea.
There is no doubt that the overwhelming ma-
jority of the American people do see this issue
in proper perspective. But an articulate though
small minority in our own country, and more in
some other countries, sometimes seem to fail to
distinguish friend from foe.
When it is possible to take the long view, we
may ﬁnd that one of the sad circumstances of these
days has been the proclivity of some of our friends
in various parts of the world to confuse Commu-
nist imperialism with bona ﬁde nationalism.
Slron Song of Communlsm
The siren song of communism in Asia, that it is
spearheading a pan-Asiatic revulsion against
white colonialism and imperialism, has beguiled
many Asians of good will who would not know-
ingly play the Communist game. \Vhen the Com-
munists so plausibly take over and exploit to their
own evil purposes the discontent of Eastern peo-
ples with their poor lot in life, perhaps it is no
wonder that many are deceived.
Equally to be deplored is the occasional tend-
ency to regard with considerable reserve any
Asiatic government which is standing four square
against Communist encroachment and is partic-
ipating in the U. S. mutual defense assistance
program as being somehow under foreign domi-
nation and less representative of its people than
a government whose position is equivocal. The
suspicion does not seem to attach e ually to Euro-
pean countries participating in t e program-—
only the Asian countries.
A word of caution now against those who say
that the battlelines are now drawn and that we
must immediately make a fateful leap in one direc-
tion or the other. They would have us either
enter into a full pro ram of attempted a pease-
ment of communism in Asia, or else embar upon
a dangerously provocative course which might
soon embroil us in active hostilities with conse-
quences be 0nd measure.
Althoug they would not admit it, their counsel
in effect is that we must 'ump either into the -
ing pan or the ﬁre. e do not propose to o
eit er.
ﬁur course is what we conceive of as a middle
one, calculated to limit the ca ability of the enem
for further aggression and tolbuild up the strength
of our friends. In that direction lies the best ho
for peaceful attainment of our objectives, and t 0
best preparation for any new challenge that may
be ﬂung at us.
Nonrocognltlon of Communlst Roglmo
One often-asked question deserves an answer:
“Since recognition doesn’t signify approval,
wh don’t we ‘accept reality’ and recognize the
Chinese Communist regime which is in full con-
rol of the country?”
To start with, let us take a look at the four
general] accepted criteria which a new regime
ordinari y must meet before its recognition as a
legitimate government and its acceptance into the
sisterhood of nations. These four criteria are (1)
effective control over the territory of the country;
(2) sovereign independence; (3) truly representa-
tive character—something in the nature of a man-
date from the people governed, or at least their
consent without coercion; and (4) acceptance of
its inherited and generally recognized treaty and
other international obligations and adherence to
a pretty well established minimum standard of
decency in its treatment of foreign nationals and
interests within its borders.
Of these four criteria it would seem that the
Peiping regime meets only the ﬁrst and that is
perhaps the least essential of the four.
Repeatedly we have recognized governments in
exile which could not meet the ﬁrst criterion.
But it would be a serious mater to overlook the
other three tests.
The Chinese Communists do not measure up
under any of them. They are subservient to Mos-
