have been withheld pending Uruguay’s signature.
In addition to an undertaking by Uru uay not
to im )ose duties higher than t 1088 speciﬁed for
a num er of products of interest to US. exporters,
the agreement provides for the making of adj ust-
ments by Uruguay in ﬁxed ofﬁcial valuations
(“aforos”) which Uruguay uses as a basis for as-
sessing “ad valorem” rates of duty. Such adjust-
ments are to be brought about without any increase
in the resulting incidence of duties as compared
with the incidence at the time the concessions were
negotiated.
Among the U.S. concessions initially negotiated
with Uruguay which were withheld pending Uru-
guay’s signature are the following to which effect
is given as of December 16, 1953. The duty on
cattle hides, now 5 percent ad valorem, will be re-
duced to 4 percent ad valorem. Binding of the
existing duty becomes eﬂ'ective on casein. Exist-
ing duty-free status of the following becomes
bound against change: unmanufactured agates,
dried blood; crude bones; bones, ground, ash,
dust, meal, and ﬂour; animal carbon for fer-
tilizer; and tankage, unﬁt for human consump-
tion.
