one of the best meals I had was at an enlisted
men’s mess on Okinawa. But the second point is
this—that they are representing America well
abroad. I was proud of what our GI’s were doing,
and many of the local people with whom I talked
told me instance after instance of how ﬁnely and
how ably the American GI’s were representing the
best of America in their service abroad.
And now may I ask you a question? Or should
I say this is the question that you might ask me:
What can I do? What can you do in this great
cause about which I have been talking?
\Vell, ﬁrst of all, let me say thatiiy deed and
word and thought it is essential that we rove
that the American ideals of tolerance, our elief
in liberty, our belief in equal rights, prove that
they exist and prove that we are dedicated to
them. May I give you an example? One day I
attended a dinner at which two legislators of a
. foreign country were present. One of them had
ot an unfavorable impression of America because
1e visited a city in which he got on a bus and the
bus driver made him move to the back of the bus
because his skin was not white. And another one,
on the other hand, had got a very favorable im-
pression of America because he visited a city and
was lined u at a restaurant which had a big crowd
in it, and e said, and I’m uotin him. that a
white man who was single a lowe him and his
wife to go ahead of him in the line when a table
for two opened up. Little things, you say, but
very important things.
And may I just say in that connection that every
act of racial discrimination or prejudice in the
United States is blown up by the Communists
abroad, and it hurts America as much as an espion-
age agent who turns over a weapon to a foreign
enemy. And every American citizen can con-
tribute toward creating a better understanding of
American ideals abroad by practicing and think-
ing tolerance and respect for human rights every
day of the year.
\Vell, this is just 2 days before Christmas, and
in most of the places we have visited Christmas,
as you know, is not celebrated. But the Christmas
spirit is there. Let me give you my last example.
Mrs. Nixon and I stopped at a school in Hong
Kong. It was an unexpected stop and the chil-
dren swarmed around us and we talked to them
and signed autographs, and as we were leaving,
one of the teachers who spoke English thanked me
for stopping. And I asked him to give this
message. I said: “Tell the children of the school
that I bring greetings and best wishes from all the
children of America to all the children of China.”
And he turned to me and said, “I will tell them
that, and will you express our greetings to the
children of America.”
And he said: “May I tell you, Mr. Vice Pres-
ident, we are all brothers in our hearts.”
May I say ﬁnally, we are fortunate to live in
America, to enjoy our liberties, and you can be
sure that in the future we will join with other
free peoples to build a world in which all men may
be free, in which nations may be independent, and
in which peoples may live in peace with their
neighbors.
Reduction of U.S. Forces In Korea
Statement by the President
White House press release dated December 26
The ﬁghting in Korea was ended by an armistice
which has now been in effect for 5 months. We do
not need as much rround strength there now as
when there was ﬁg iting. That is the more true
because of the capabilities of ROK forces which
were substantially built up during the war. Also
our growing national air power possesses greater
mobility and greater striking force than ever
before.
Accordingl I have directed that the United
States groun forces in Korea be pro essively re-
duced as circumstances warrant. is an initial
ste , two Army divisions will soon be withdrawn
an returned to the United States. While the
United States is acting in good faith to preserve
the armistice and accom lish its urposes, we re-
main alert to all possibilities. herefore, I em-
phasize that the actio‘h'being taken does not impair
our readiness and capacity to react in a way which
should deter aggression and, if aggression should
nevertheless occur, to oppose it with even greater
effect than heretofore.
Recently the United Nations members which
had forces in Korea clearly stated that, together,
we would be united and prompt to resist any re-
newal of armed attack.1 The same statement
pointed out that “the consequences of such a
breach of the armistice would be so grave that, in
all probability, it would not be possible to conﬁne
hostilities within the frontiers of Korea.”
The United States military forces in the Far
East will be maintained at appropriate levels to
take account of the foregoing and to fulﬁll the
commitments which the United States has under-
taken in that area, and which are vital to the se~
curity of the United States. These forces will
feature highly mobile naval, air, and amphibious
units.
Thus, we move forward in pursuance of our
broad policy to make evident to all the world that
we ourselves have no aggressive intentions and that
we are resourceful and vigilant to ﬁnd ways to
reduce the burdens of armament and to promote a
climate of peace.
