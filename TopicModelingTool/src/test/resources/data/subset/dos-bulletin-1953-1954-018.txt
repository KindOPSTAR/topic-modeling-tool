Attempted Negotlatlons at Panmunlom
b y Ambassador Arthur H. Dean ‘
As the Special Envoy appointed by President
Eisenhower and Secretary of State Dulles, I am
reporting to the American people tonight on my
7 weeks’ attempted negotiations at Panmunjom
Korea, with the dele ates from Red China an
Communist North orea in an effort to bring
about an early convening of the Korean peace
conference.
The Communists usually introduce false prem-
ises, exaggerations, colorations of fact, distortions
of the truth, and completely false accusations for
ropaganda purposes to mislead and to divert.
ese talks were no exception.
At the meetin on December 10, 1953, in an un-
interrupted 5%- our session, the Chinese delegate,
Huang Hua, after several warnings from me ac-
cused the United States of America of erﬁdy or
deliberate treachery in connection with t e release
of prisoners by President Rhee of the Republic of
Korea on June 17-18 I after Lieutenant General
Harrison had signed the terms of reference for
prisoners on June 8, 1953.‘
My Government has never been guilty of perﬁdy
and pray God it never shall.
I told him that his statement was false—that my
Government was not guilty of perﬁdy and unless
he withdrew the charge I would treat the meetings
as in indeﬁnite recess. He re eated the charge.
And I withdrew in rotest. o my mind it is
quite sufﬁcient. If had not, the Communists
would have broadcast far and wide that a re re-
sentative of the United States Govarnment d
admitted the charge of perﬁdy.
President Rhee said to me, “We salute you, Mr.
Dean, for the stand you took to teach the Soviets
that they cannot all the time throw insults at the
United States of America and get away with
them.”
Tonight I shall explain to you what we were
talking about at Panmunjom and why, and where
we go from here.

In our preliminary talks with the Communists
we were endeavorin to bring about the litical
or peace conference or Korea called for y para-
gra h 60 of the Armistice Agreement.
e urpose of the political conference origi-
nally sclicduled for October 28 is “to settle through
negotiation the questions of the withdrawal of all
foreign forces from Korea, the peaceful settlement
of the Korean question, etc.” The Korean ques-
tion is the uniﬁcation of a free, independent, and
democratic Korea.
The nations I represented at these preliminary
talks consisted of the 17 nations contributing
troo s to the United Nations Command, includin
the nited States of America and the Republic 0
Korea.
The other side consisted of Red China and Com-
munist North Korea. Not present, but really
there, was the U.S.S.R., which, as everyone knows,
actually instigated the aggressmn in Korea in June
1950.
As you know, through the noble and persistent
efforts of President isenhower, the Armistice
Agreement was signed by both sides on July 27,
1953, and was desi ed to brin about “a complete
cessation of hosti 1ties and 0 all acts of armed
force in Korea until a ﬁnal peaceful settlement is
achieved. ” ‘
The ﬁghting and the bloodshed and the destruc-
tion have been stopped.
If the political conference is not held, does that
mean hostilities will be resumed? No—it does
not. The armistice agreement provides that it
shall remain in effect until expressly su rseded.
\Vill the Communists resume hostilities? I do
not think so. The destruction in North Korea is
indescribable. Whole villages have been wiped
out, power stations have been destroyed, and ac-
tories, roads, farmhouses, and ublic facilities are
in ruins. The Communists too a terriﬁc beating.
We stopped the tide and timetable of Red aggres-
sion.
Posters all over North Korea depict peace, and
children releasing white doves. The emphasis is
on civilian building. The construction of huge
