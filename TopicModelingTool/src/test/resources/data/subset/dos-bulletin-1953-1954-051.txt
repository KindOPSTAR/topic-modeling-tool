only secure source of tin for half the world, the
rice of tin from Bolivia then soared to fantastic
heights despite our efforts to control it; and since
goods of all sorts were simultaneously scarce, this
stimulated inﬂation in Bolivia. Having bought
tin furiously during the crises, we stopped buying
once they were over, and tin dropped as precipi-
tously in rice as it had risen.
With t e national economy de endent on tin,
even the wisdom of Solomon wou d not sufﬁce to
direct Bolivian economic aﬁ'airs under such cir-
cumstances. If the Bolivians forget that we also
controlled the prices of products we sold them,
that the dollar saved by our citizens—and the one
borrowed by Bolivia—sank as much in purchasing
sower as the dollar Bolivia saved from tin sales
uring the crises, we should emphatically not for-
get the impression it makes, in terms of hard eco-
nomics as well as psychology, when we beg the
Bolivians to produce all the tin they can at one
moment and at the next won’t buy it at an price.
I shall leave the intricacies of price stabilization
and the controversy regarding expropriation to
the com etent international forums, but I do want
to sa t at, regardless of rights or wrongs, I do
not t ink we should permit people in Bolivia to go
hungry, and I think we would be very unwise to
drive the unpent social forces in Bolivia into the
gently smiling jaws of communism.
We should remember that the story of the Boliv-
ian tin miner could be told almost equally well of
the lead and zinc miners in Peru and Mexico,
countries moreover with which we have particu-
larly friendly relations. If the impact of eat
ﬂuctuations in the prices of those metals has en
less severe on those countries, it has been because
their economies are more diversiﬁed and their gov-
ernments have shown much statesmanship in
handling national economic affairs. The story
might a so be told of the Chilean copper miners—
which brings us to another story.
In Santiago de Chile an American utility com-
pany has until recently been unable to obtain from
the Chilean authorities rates which would permit
it to earn a fair return on their investment. San-
tiago is a rapidly developing city, and its demands
for electricity are growmg by leaps and bounds.
If that demand is to be met, new capital must be
obtained. It cannot be obtained from earnings if
earnings are insufﬁcient; and it cannot be obtained
from investors if they do not think the company
is a good investment. The Chilean may feel in-
adequate electric rates not only in dim lights and
a quavering radio; it may rob him of his job when
there isn’t enough power to run the factory.
But, the Chilean will naturally think, this is a
rich and greedy foreign monopoly which is trying
to rob me. Remember that his income is only
about one-eighth of that of an American and that
his family budget has been just as hard hit by the
chronic inﬂation in Chile as has that of the utility
company. He thinks of the company as big,
wealthy, and foreign; he forgets that it is owned
by thousands of American stockholders who like
him are trying to raise families on painfull tight
budgets. If the Chilean is not altogether air, let-
us remember that John Q. Public in the United
States too has not always been fair in his views
regarding business. If American com anies have
not always been fairly treated in Latin America
let us remember that, as in the United States, they
have not always acted fairly.
The record of American business in Latin
America has been increasingly good. Upon the
respective Latin American governments, rather
than ours, devolves the responsibility of seeing
that any remaining abuses are checked and that
business in their countries is conducted in the
national interest. Today I believe that it is a fact
that foreign business in Latin America is more
sinned against than sinning; that in some sectors
several atin American governments have gone
so far in harassment and restrictive measures as
to discourage the further foreign investment which
is so essential to their national development. I
am not referring to crass conﬁscation under Com-
munist inspiration; I refer to the multi le, onerous
economic controls which, in Dr. Mi ton Eisen-
hower’s words, spell creeping expropriation.
Latin American voices to which we listen with
the i hest respect in the United States have sug-
gestedg recently that they do not favor further
American investments in their respective coun-
tries. Let me make it unmistakably clear that the
Government of the United States is not trying to
force American investments on any countr which
does not wish to receive them. We consi er that
a country’s policies in re ard to new foreign in-
vestment are for its sole etermination in accord-
ance with its conception of the national interests.
Folr Treatment of Investments
We do ex ect fair treatment of our investments
already ma e in good faith. lVe feel it roper to
make representations on their behalf if tgiey have
been denied a remedy or suffered discrimination
under national law or if valid contracts with gov-
ernments have been unilaterally breached and jus-
tice denied. Obviously our policy in inter-
American relations does not place the protection
of our private investments at the top of our objec-
tives—our national security, for example, takes
precedence—but it is an important objective and
duty. We believe it should be an even more im-
portant objective of our sister republics, given
their present stage of development, to cultivate a
reputation of treating foreign capital fairly. A
reputation is acquired over the years—and can be
destroyed in a day.
No one, for example, raises an eyebrow when a
government buys out a foreign company by mutual
agreement, but a country may do itself great d15—
