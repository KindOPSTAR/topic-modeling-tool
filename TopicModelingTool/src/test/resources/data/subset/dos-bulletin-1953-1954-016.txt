There was another story. There is a river that
as arates Free China, or I should say the China
w iich is art of the New Territories in Hong
Kong, an the mainland of China, and on either
side of the river the peasants till the ﬁelds. As we
looked down almost a mile away to that area I
asked one of my Chinese friends who was an inter-
preter what was the difference between the eas-
ants on the Communist side of the river an _the
peasants on the other side of the river. He smiled
and said to me, “Well the major difference is that
the peasants on the Communist side of the river
pay about ﬁve times as much taxes as the ones on
the other side of the river.”
And then there was another example that was
given. They told me how across this river a widow
who was 70 years of age had crossed for many,
many years because she owned lands on both sides
of the river. But one day when she crossed, a Com-
munist uard shot her down. The ﬁrst shot
wounde her. He then walked up to her and
pumped three bullets into her back. Now what
does this all add up to? It means that the Commu-
nists’ deeds are catching up with them. And that
is why they are losing support not only among the
Chinese outside of the mainland of China but also
within China itself, and that’s why they are losing
exipport among peoples everywhere throughout
sia.
I wish I had the time to tell on about India—
India with all of its problems, ndia which needs
peace and wants peace in order that they can con-
solidate their new] won independence and in
order that they can eal with their great problems.
I wish I could tell you about India, and Indonesia,
about Burma, about Pakistan. The time is going
on and I must get on to some of the other roblems
that I wish to touch upon, because all 0 you are
going to ask an obvious uestion. And that ques-
tion is: “What does all t is add up to?” It adds
up to this, that the greatest danger that we face
today in Asia is no longer in my opinion armed
aggression. The greatest danger that we face is
internal subversion and revolution.
That is why Korea was so important. When
the Communists failed to extend their empire by
overt aggression in Korea, they lost their chance
to extend their control over the other nations in
Asia, in my opinion. They know that if they move
overtly any place else in the world, they will run
the risk of being stopped by the united forces of
the free nations. If they had not been stopped
in Korea, the risk of their moving somewhere else
in Asia or in Europe would have been increased
immeasurably. The danger from subversive tac-
tics in this area of the world is great, but I have
faith as to the outcome because I have faith in
the fundamental good sense of the people.
Did you ever stop to think what the people
of Asia want? Well, they want independence.
They want economic progress. They want peace.
They want freedom of choice as to their culture,
religion, and their economic systems. And they
want fundamental recognition of their equal dig-
nity as human beings. And communism in prac-
tice, as the great Indian philosopher and states-
man, Raj opalachari, the Chief Minister of
Madras, to d me, communism in practice will even-
tually fail because it runs counter to human na-
ture. Communism in practice goes against all
the fundamental desires of the eoples of Asia.
Instead of inde endence it has rought colonial
imperialism an slavery. Instead of economic
regress it has brought poverty. Instead of peace
it has brought war. It denies a choice of en ture,
a choice of religion or of an economic system to
those who are under Communist domination. And
so the obvious question now that on will ask is
this: What’s the matter then? \V y are we wor-
ried? And the problem is that we are not get-
ting our message across, and when I speak of our
messa e, I mean the message of the free nations.
Un ortunately we must recognize that there are
millions of people in this area of the world who
honest] believe in their hearts that the United
States is just as great a threat to the peace of the
world as is the Soviet Union and Communist
China. And they believe that we ma use our
military power aggressively, just as quickly as will
the Communists. Fortunately, may I say that
under the President we are ﬁnally getting the
kind of leadershi which is bringing to the world
the true icture of) American policy. In his speech
of A ri 16 and then in his eat speech before
the nited Nations, the PreSident has taken the
offensive in the drive for peace, and for the ﬁrst
time the Communists are on the defensive all over
the world.

Now there are other questions that I know you
would be asking if I were with on. And one of
them would be one that I woul expect, and it is
this: \Vhat about the eople that you know who
are in these areas of tie world that we visited?
And may I tell you something about them. First
of all, the people who serve in our Foreign Service,
the people who are with our diplomatic missions,
with our aid missions and with the various other
American missions abroad. May I say that I was
very favorably impressed with the ple in our
Foreign Service and in our various missions
abroad with whom I came in contact. They are
capable. They are hard working. They are
dedicated to the interests of America. And others
of you I’m sure would ask me what about our
military people, the men in service. We visited
Okinawa, we visited Korea, we visited Japan,
we visited Libya, and we saw thousands of GI’s
in all of these areas. And I should like to
leave one message with you tonight in regard to
them. First, they are being well treated. I think
