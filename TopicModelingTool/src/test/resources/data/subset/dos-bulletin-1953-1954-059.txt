Issues Involved in
Syrian Complalnt
Statements by Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.
U .8. Representative to the United Nations 1
U.S./UN. press release dated December 16
The Security Council since October 27 has had
under consideration the Syrian complaint on the
diversion of the Jordan River. We have heard
the representatives of Syria, Israel, Lebanon, and
Pakistan in a number of important statements.
The United States has followed the development
of the debate with intense interest. As a result
we have come to the following conclusions:
First, strict compliance with the armistice
agreement entered into between Israel and Syria
is of vital importance to the peace of the area and
this question is intimately involved in the present
case.
Second, the primary responsibility of the Secu-
rity Council in this matter is to uphold that
armistice agreement which it endorsed in its reso-
lution of 11 August 1949 as superseding the truce
and facilitating the transition to permanent peace.
The agent of the Security Council for these pur-
poses is the Chief of Staff of the Truce Super-
vision Organization.
‘ Made in the Security Council on Dec. 16 and Dec. 21.
Third, development projects which are con-
sistent with the undertakin of the parties under
the armistice agreement an which are in the n-
eral interest and do not infringe upon establis ed
rights and obligations should be encouraged. The
decision of the Chief of Staﬂ for the continuance
of the diversion of the Jordan River project would
be subject to these considerations. The Chief of
Staﬁ, as the authority responsible for the general
supervision of the demilitarized zone, is the proper
authority to determine whether the roject now in
question meets these conditions. ny unilateral
action from whatever side, which is not consistent
with this authority of the Chief of Staff threatens
the effective operation and enforcement of the
armistice agreement. Similarly, no government
should, in our opinion, exercise a veto power over
legitimate projects in the demilitarized zone.
On the basis of these conclusions, the United
States has joined with France and the United
Kingdom in submitting for the consideration of
the Council the draft resolution which has been
circulated. This resolution makes clear, in our
opinion:
(a) That the Chief of Staff of the Truce Super-
viswn Organization, as Chairman of the Syrian-
Israel Mixed Armistice Commission, is the respon-
sible authority with respect to questions aﬂ'ectin
the demilitarized zone under article 5 of the armi-
stice agreement;
(b) That the issues raised by the Jordan River
diversion project should be judged by the Chief
of Staff in accordance with his authority under
the armistice a cement, and
(c) That in t ese and other questions concerning
the status of the demilitarized zone an important
consideration should be the just and orderly de-
velopment of the natural resources affected, with
due regard for the general welfare and the inter-
ests of the parties and individuals concerned.
To these ends, Mr. President, we hope that the
Governments of Israel and Syria will cooperate
fully with the Chief of Staff and that they will
mutually beneﬁt from his decisions. In the opin-
ion of the United States, the draft resolution rep-
resents the proper line of action for the Security
Council to take in this case.
U.S./UN. press release dated December 21
At the last meeting of the Security Council the
representative of China, who, I believe, was sup-
ported in this by the representative of Pakistan,
took the position that the language of the pending
resolution was not clear as regards the rights of
the parties under the armistice agreement.
While I do not share their doubts and while it
seems to me perfectly clear that the Chief of Staff
would in the normal course under the terms of this
resolution naturally seek to reconcile the interests
of the two parties and would consult with them,
