SOVIET GOVERNMENT'S
STATEMENT OF DECEMBER 21
[Unomcial translation]
In his speech before the United Nations General Assem-
bly on December 8,‘ President Eisenhower of the United
States of America dwelt on the problem of the atomic
arms race.
With good reason, the United States President empha-
sized the danger for the peoples of the world of the situa-
tion created if governments do not take measures against
the atomic arms race. This is all the more correct now
when, in addition to atomic weapons, there have already
been created hydrogen weapons which greatly surpass the
atomic in their power. One must also not forget such new
types of armament as rocket weapons which current tech-
nology permits to be used over thousands of kilometers
without resort to airplanes, and also torpedoes with atomic
warheads, et cetera.
The discovery of the practical possibility of using atomic
energy is the greatest achievement of contemporary sci-
ence and technology. Both the possibility of using atomic
energy for military purposes and the possibility of its use
for peaceful purposes have been opened up. Up to recent
times, attempts have been made for the most part to use
atomic energy for the production of armaments. Mean-
while, humanity is interested in having atomic energy
used only for peaceful needs and in preventing the use. of
atomic energy for those purposes which are contrary to
popular honor and conscience, like mass destruction of
people and barbaric ruin of cities.
Almost 30 years ago the governments of 49 tates
‘ BULLETIN of Dec. 21, 1953, p. s47.
reached an agreement and signed the Geneva Protocol of
1925 regarding the prohibition of the use of chemical and
bacteriological weapons, having recognized as a crime the
use of such weapons of mass destruction of people. This
agreement between governments, signed also by the Soviet
Union in its turn, produced positive results.
Everyone knows that during the First World War there
were widely used such weapons of mass destruction of
people as suffocating and poisonous gases and also other
types of chemical weapons whose use has met with deci-
sive popular condemnation. Even at that time there was
also imminent the threat of the use of injurious bacterio-
logical weapons serving the purpose of infecting peaceful
inhabitants of cities with gravest illnesses, a situation
with which the conscience of the great majority of people
could not reconcile itself. This gave rise to the necessity
for international agreement in the form of the above-
mentioned Geneva Protocol which condemned and prohib-
ited the use of chemical and bacteriological weapons
in war.
If it had not been for this Protocol, signed by 49 states
although still not ratiﬁed by all states, it is completely
obvious that there would have existed no restraining
factor whatsoever against the use of chemical and bacteri-
ological weapons in the Second World War as well. The
fact that in the Second World War not a single govern~
ment decided to use chemical and bacteriological weapons
shows that the above-mentioned agreement among states
directed against chemical and bacteriological weapons had
a favorable effect. At the same time it goes without say-
ing that one must not belittle the fact that, taking their
stand upon this international agreement, the states of the
anti-Hitler coalition ﬁrmly announced that attempts by
the enemy to use chemical weapons in war would be given
a crushing repulse.
The observations which have been made are also fully
applicable to atomic and hydrogen weapons. It is known
that the United Nations do not classify these weapons
with conventional types of armament but consider them
as a special type of weapons, weapons of mass destruction.
One can understand the fact that President Eisenhower,
who is known as one of the outstanding military leaders
in the last World War, has emphasized the destructive
power of atomic weapons. It is also necessary to bear in
mind that the signiﬁcance of this problem is acquiring still
greater force with the passage of time.
It would be completely incomprehensible if states which
have atomic or hydrogen weapons did not attach the requi-
site signiﬁcance to the question of prohibition of atomic
and hydrogen weapons, like other types of weapons of
mass destruction. or if they were to put oi! until some
undetermined future time the achievement of international
agreement on this question. Such an approach to this
important and urgent problem could ﬁnd no justiﬁcation.
The Soviet Union is consistently struggling for the pro-
hibition of atomic weapons and, in addition, for the sig-
niﬁcant reduction of all other types of armaments. This
corresponds with the policy of the Soviet Government
which is directed toward the prevention of a new war
and the strengthening of peace and cooperation among
peoples.
In his speech regarding atomic weapons on December 8,
the President of the United States of America noted the
great signiﬁcance of the problem of easing international
tension and the creation of an atmosphere of mutual peace-
ful trust. This is also in accordance with the views of the
Soviet Government which unswervingly is striving to con-
tribute to the lessening of tension in international rela-
tions and to assure the strengthening of peace in the whole
world.
In order to achieve successes in this course, mutual
eﬁ'orts to remove factors interfering with the lessening of
tension in international relations are necessary. As re-
gards the Soviet Union, we are doing everything to con-
centrate the labor of the Soviet people and our material
resources on the solution of the new gigantic tasks of fur-
ther raising the peaceful economy and the culture of the
country and further to widen international economic co-
