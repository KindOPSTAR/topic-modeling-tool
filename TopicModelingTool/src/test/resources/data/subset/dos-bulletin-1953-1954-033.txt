Dated September 14, 1953
[Excerpts]
I herewith submit report number 70 of the United Na-
tions Command Operations in Korea for the period 16—31
May 1953, inclusive. United Nations Command commu-
niques numbers 1616—1631 provide detailed accounts of
these operations.
At the 16 May plenary session the United Nations Com-
mand Delegation again pressed unsuccessfully for Com-
munist acceptance of the Terms of Reference pr0posed by
the United Nations Command on 13 May.’ In the face
of continued Communist opposition the United Nations
Command proposed a recess until 20 May for administra-
tive reasons. On 19 May at the request of the United Na-
tions Command, Liaison Oﬂicers met. In this meeting the
United Nations Command Liaison Ofﬁcer requested that
the current recess be continued until 25 May 1953. Com-
munist Liaison Ofﬁcers replied that their Delegation con-
sidered that negotiations should not be delayed, but stated

that their side agreed to continue in recess until 25 May
1953.
On 25 May the Main Delegations met in plenary session
and the United Nations Command Delegation announced
that it had a new proposal to submit. The United Nations
Command then requested that, in order to permit the
most careful and solemn consideration of its latest pro-
posal, it desired that all details of the meeting be trans-
acted ln Executive Session. After a ﬁfteen minute recess
the communists agreed that all details of the meetings
would be kept secret until one side or the other announced
their desire to resume regular open sessions.
On 31 May the Communists requested a meeting of Liai-
son Oﬂicers and announced that their Delegation requested
a further recess until 4 June. The United Nations Com-
mand Liaison Ofﬁcer immediately agreed to the extension
of recess requested by the Communists.
In January, the United Nations Command issued a pub-
lication entitled “The Communist War in Prisoner of War
Camps".' This document exposed. clearly and factually,
the eﬂorts being made by subversive Communist agencies
to use those prisoners of war in United Nations Command
custody as part of their over-all military effort.
United Nations Command leaﬂets, radio broadcasts, and
loudspeaker broadcasts during this period gave particular
attention to summarizing the United Nations Command
position in the armistice negotiations. Petitions received
from prisoners of war, fervently expressing their opposi-
tion to forcible repatriation, were made public. The nu-
merous constructive steps taken by the United Nations
Command to narrow the area of disagreement on an armi-
stice were outlined to civilians and troops in enemy-held
territory. Details of the 25 May United Nations Command
proposal were not disclosed because of its presentation in
executive session, but radio broadcasts stressed the urgent
need for constructive action on the part of the Communists
to match that of the United Nations Command.
