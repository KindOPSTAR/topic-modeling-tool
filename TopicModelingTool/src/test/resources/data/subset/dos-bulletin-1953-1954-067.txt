Within the limits of funds available, the Combined Eco-
nomic Board will endeavor to ensure that obligations are
made as expeditiously as possible and that the procure-
ment, actual arrival. and distribution of goods are ex-
pedited as much as possible.
In order to raise the planned investment in the pro-
gram to the highest level consistent with ﬁnancial stability,
all endeavors will be made to keep the deﬁcit in the liOK
war account budget, which is due to the heavy defense
expenditures, at a minimum through careful screening of
expenditures and the adoption of measures designed to
increase tax and other revenues, and to reduce the relief
element in the aid program. Investments will be pro-
grammed in such a manner that, due regard having been
given to the importance of selecting essential investment,
all efforts will be made for the maximum feasible share
of the total cost to be borne by funds derived from such
current income, proﬁts, and savings as are available in
accordance with Annex A.
The Government of the Republic of Korea has estab-
lished the oﬁicial exchange rate of 180 hwan per US
dollar. The Government of the Republic of Korea and
the Government of the United States of America have
agreed to cooperate fully within the framework of the
economic reconstruction and ﬁnancial stabilization pro-
gram, to prevent further inﬂation and to create stable
economic and ﬁnancial conditions in Korea.
Counterpart deposits at a rate of 180 hwan per US
dollar will be made by the Government of the Republic
of Korea for all aid goods and services which arrive on or
after August 28. 1953. An amount not exceeding 5 per-
cent of the amount cumulatively deposited, except as the
Combined Economic Board may approve a higher per-
centage, shall be released from the counterpart account for
local expenses of the UN/US organizations administering
the aid program. The remainder of the counterpart fund
will be administered by the Combined Economic Board
with a view of covering eligible expenditure items in the
ROK war account budget and for such other purposes as
may be agreed. It is understood that decisions concern-
ing the use of that part of the counterpart fund which is
generated by UNKaA-ﬁnanced imports will be subject
to the approval of the agent general of UNKRA.
The Government of the Republic of Korea has decided
to limit the expansion of credit granted by the Bank of
Korea and the commercial banks to an annual amount of
hwan 5 billion, except for credit granted for the pur-
pose of making counterpart deposits and credit extended
from the counterpart fund. It is presently estimated that
the total credit expansion which can take place through
the banking system without endangering ﬁnancial economic
stability would be at the rate of hwan 11 billion in the
coming twelve months. This magnitude of credit ex-
pansion together with the utilization of Korean and aid
funds is designed to make possible an increased level of
industrial recovery and reconstruction and at the same
time to preserve essential ﬁnancial stability.
Mutualiy satisfactory procurement arrangements now
being developed will be instituted and announced shortly.
These will include suitable arrangements to enable en-
terprises to utilize FOA funds for the purpose of acquir-
ing necessary plant, materials and machines.
The pricing of aid goods and services offered for sale in
Korea shall be directed at maximizing collections from
these sales in accordance with the principles set forth in
Annex B.
All funds collected from the sale of aid goods that arrive
on or after August 28, 1953 will be deposited in a col-
lection account with the exception of those amounts needed
for meeting the cost of internal distribution of such goods.
The collection account will be used to reduce the indebted-
ness of the Government of the Republic of Korea to the
Bank of Korea and for such other purposes as may be
agreed upon.
This program will be carried out by skillful and vigor-
ous action as the actual course of developments unfolds.
Flexibility in administering the program will be com-

bined with the ﬁrm resolution to achieve the goals of the
program. Prior to the actual initiation of the programmed
projects, the Combined Economic Board will determine
whether they retain their original economic usefulness
and ﬁnancial feasibility in the light of subsequent de
veiopments.
The quantitative implications of the program are now
being developed.
The Economic Coordination Agreement of 1952‘ and
the Economic Aid Agreement of 1948 shall be amended
in accordance with Annex C.’

Annex A
FINANCING THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM
1. The CEB is agreed that the greatest possible portion of
the total cost of programmed investment shall be con‘
tributed by enterprises from their own funds or savings
rather than from credit. This policy principle is a re
quirement of the investment program in order to ensure
its consistency with the attainment of ﬁnancial stabiliza-
tion during the current program period.
2. In order to attain this objective, it is agreed that
in the assignment of individual investment projects pref-
erence will be given to enterprises which are able to con-
tribute the largest share of the total project costs from
their own funds or savings. As a general rule no enter-
prise will be eiigible for assignment of a new investment
project within the program unless it can provide an agreed
minimum proportion of the total cost of the project from
savings.
3. The Can shall, on the basis of recommendations of
the appropriate Can committees, devise detailed pro-
cedures for implementing these principles and review
the progress of ﬁnancing the investment program. It is
agreed that signiﬁcant shortfalls in the proportion of
savings obtained for ﬁnancing the investment program
will require adjustment in the volume of investment goods
imported under the program in order to maintain balance
with other elements of the ﬁnancial stabilization program.
Annex B
FORMULATION 0F PRICING POLICY
1. The Combined Economic Board shall accept as a
basic principle in formulation of pricing policy the desir-
ability of moving as rapidly as feasible in the direction of
price determination through the operation of free market
forces.
2. Aid goods from all sources which are offered for sale
in Korea shall be sold at prices approximating those of
similar items in the free market, but not less than prices
reﬂecting the hwan value of the dollar landed cost con-
verted at the established exchange rate plus all costs of
internal distribution. As exceptions the Combined Econo-
mic Board may in its discretion temporarily permit prices
of certain aid goods to reﬂect less than the commensurate
hwan value of the dollar landed cost converted at the
established exchange rate, where such action will con-
tribute to the achievement of important program objec-
tives. It is understood that, whenever deemed necessary,
aid goods may be sold by auction sale.
3. In all cases, the internal distribution costs of im-
ported aid goods, except of those distributed free as relief
