forces between Arab States and what is now Israel.
The movements and inter-relationshi of events
which resulted in this situation are eyond the
scope of this study, except to the extent that the
continue to inﬂuence the attitudes of the Ara
States and Israel in dealing with the refugee prob-
lem as outlined in Section VIII below. Brieﬂy,
it may be said that following the Balfour Declara-
tion of 1917, favoring the establishment in Pales-
tine of a national home for the Jewish eople, there
was increasing friction between Ara s and Jews
as the latter became more numerous and achieved
a recognized status through the Jewish Agency
under the British mandate. The persecution of
the Jews by the Nazis before and during World
War II led to increased pressures for mass Jewish
migration to Palestine and for the creation of a
Jewish state.
The seriousness of the problem and the question
of the legal status of the Palestine Mandate under
the League of Nations led the British Government
to place the Palestine question before a s ial
session of the General Assembly of the nited
Nations in April 1947. In response to the British
proposal, the General Assembly established a Spe-
cial Committee on Palestine to submit proposals
for the solution of the Palestine problem in
September 1947. Its report furnished the basis
for the decision of the General Assembly, Novem-
ber 29, 1947, adopting a Plan of Partition for
Palestine.
Under the rovisions of this resolution, the Gen-
eral Assembi; recommended the creation of an
Arab State and a Jewish State from the former
Palestine Mandate, with a separate international
status for the City of Jerusalem. The establish-
ment of the two roposed states was to be under
the auspices of a nited Nations commission. The
immediate rejection of this proposal by the Arab
nations, the indicated determination of the British
Government to surrender authority over the man-
dated area, and the determined planning by J ew-
ish elements to assume the statehood recommended
for them by the General Assembly led to violence
and terrorism in the area. Thus when on May 15,
1948, Israel declared its statehood and was im-
mediately recognized by the United States and
several other nations and when on the same date
the British Government formally surrendered its
mandatory owers, open hostilities broke out be-
tween arm forces of neighboring Arab States
and Israel.
By reason of hostilities, hundreds of thousands
of Palestinian Arabs ﬂed to neighboring Arab
countries, hopeful of an early return to their for-
mer homes. n 1949 their numbers were estimated
at over 1,000,000. Approximately half of them
found refuge in the new Kingdom of Jordan.
where they constitute over one-third of the popu-
lation of that country. Over 200,000 ﬂed to the
City of Gaza and its environs, under Egyptian
control, where they out-numbered the local inhabit-
ants three to one. Another group of 100,000
moved northward to Lebanon, increasin the pop-
ulation of that country by 10%. Near y 100,000
took ref in Syria.
Their s elter was whatever they could ﬁnd—
mosques, barracks, schools, huts, and even caves.
For many months the Arab governments made
temporary arrangements for feeding them. Since
this was a burden which the Arab States could not
long sustain, they appealed to the United Nations
for help.
"I. Early United Nations Interest and Concern
\Vith the outbreak of hostilities, the United Na-
tions was immediately faced with a three-fold
task: bringing about cessation of hostilities; as-
sisting in the negotiation of armistice agreements;
and taking measures for the relief of the refugees.
Through a series of decisions by the Security
Council and as a result of negotiations conducted
by the late Count Folke Bernadotte and Dr. Ralph
Bunche in their successive roles as United Nations
mediators, the ﬁrst two tasks were substantial]
completed early in 1947. With respect to relie ,
the General Assembly of the United Nations in
November 1948 established a $32 million relief
program to be supported by voluntary contribu-
tions from all governments, with ﬁeld 0 erations
to be carried on by the League of Red ross So-
cieties, the International Committee of the Red
Cross, and the American Friends Service Com-
mittee. This was admitted] it stop-gap relief
measure which left unresolvedv the question of the
future of the refugees.
The United Nations was equally concerned with
the lon er range task of bringing about a settle-
ment 0 the outstanding issues between the Arab
States and Israel. In its resolution of December
11, 1948, the General Assembly established a Pal-
estine Conciliation Commission, whose principal
function was to assist the Governments concerned
to achieve a ﬁnal settlement of all questions out-
standing between them. In paragraph 11 of this
same resolution, it dealt with the political aspects
of the refugee question in the following terms:
11. Rerolvea that the refugees wishing to return to their
homes and live at peace with their neighbours should
be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date,
and that compensation should be paid for the property
of those choosing not to return and for loss of or damage
to property which under principles of international law
or in equity, should be made good by the Governments
or authorities responsible.
Subsequent action by the United Nations is dealt
with in Section VI below.
IV. United States Interest and Concern
The American people have a natural humani-
tarian concern in the plight of these unfortunate
people. During the past three and one-half years
they have made contributions through numerous
