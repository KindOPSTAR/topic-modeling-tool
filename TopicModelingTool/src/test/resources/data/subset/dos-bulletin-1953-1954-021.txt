Canada-United States Relations:
A Businessman-Ambassador’s Point of View
by R. Douglas Stuart
Ambassador to Canada ‘
I am most a preciative of the honor that has
been paid my overnment by the Canadian Club
of Montreal in asking me, as a representative of
the United States, to s eak to you at this time.
I have enjoyed a life ong and intimate connec-
tion with Canada. My father was born in the
town of Embro near Ingersoll, Ontario. I com-
menced my business life in Canada.
I have visited Montreal many times with pleas-
ure—in fact it was a double pleasure, because I
didn’t have to make any speeches on those occa-
sions, but here I am again 1n your charming city.
To those of you whose native ton e is French,
I wish to express the regret that, un ike the Presi-
dent, I am not able to address you in French.2
I know, however, that you understand En lish
and I humbly acknowled e that this stan s to
your credit, while my lac stands to my debit.
There are some here toda that I can happily
call friends. For the rest I am quite simpl a
businessman who has worked in Canada and t en
in the United States ever since I was a young
man. While I am as interested in business as
ever, I am here today as a diplomat—a completely
new experience for me.
Today I am chieﬂy concerned with the eco-
nomic relationships between Canada and the
United States. Consequently, I would like at this
time to take a quick look at the conduct of our
economic relationships.
The ﬁrst consideration is that by and large our
economic relationships are handled by individual
businessmen. Only to a relatively small extent
do our two Governments enter into the picture.
This is so generally so that perhaps we forget
that it contrasts with the practice in many other
countries which for various reasons have adopted
partiall or completely the ractice of state trad-
ing. e in Canada and t e United States are
ﬁrmly wedded to the private enterprise system.
My own experience amply illustrates the ex-

tent to which private business relations operate
on this continent unham red by overnment. In
a lifetime of working th in anada and the
United States I have visited nearly all of the
important business centers of both countries, but
rarely have I had to go to Washington or Ottawa.
The same applies to a at majority of men who
have hadacomparable usiness experience. Many
businessmen can work in our two countries as if
they were one market and rarely have cause to
appeal to their Governments for help.
Unlmpodod Business Relations
There has developed in the course of years an
increasin ly easy two-way ﬂow of capital into
branch p ants, subsidiaries, and other investments.
This has resulted in very close business relations
which are the bases for grassroots cooperation be-
tween our business communities.
A ﬁne example of this cooperation is the Can-
ada-United States Committee of the Chambers of
Commerce of the two countries. I had the pleas-
ure of attending the Committee’s recent meeting
in October at the Seigniory Club and was greatly
impressed by the attendance at the meeting of so
many outstanding Canadian and United States
businessmen. ThlS Committee, as I understand
it, has been in existence since 1932—a very im-
pressive fact.
In view of this easy, unimpeded, private busi-
ness activity, you might well wonder what ﬁeld is
left to our two Governments. Here we have an
elastic and often very informal area. This is
illustrated by the manner in which the vast major-
ity of joint problems are settled.
It is the custom, as ou probably know, in most
countries of the wor d for roblems, including
economic ones, to be handle rimarily through
the foreign oﬁices and the em assies. However,
the contacts between the various other depart-
ments of the Government in Ottawa and Wash-
ington are so intimate from the top level down
that the tendency is to settle their roblems be-
tween themselves and settle them quickly. Much
