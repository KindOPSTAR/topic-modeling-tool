several rail and highway bridges were destroyed and
numerous rail and road cuts were inﬂicted.
In an effort to prevent the Communists from augmenting
their air arm in Korea, another feature of naval air has
been to maintain nine designated North Korean alrﬁelds
in an unserviceable condition. These airﬁelds were at-
tacked under close observation to insure their continued
unserviceabllity.
Enemy coastaldefense positions in the Wonsan Harbor
area continued to receive special attention when weather
conditions permitted. In continuation of the effort to
neutralize this particular threat to our surface forces
and friendly-held islands, air strikes and co-ordinated
air-gun strikes were scheduled against these positions.
HoWever, the effectiveness of these strikes was lessened
due to low overcast over the target areas.
United Nations Command surface vessels continued the
naval blockade of the Korean East Coast from the vicinity
of Kosong to Chongjin. Marginal weather reduced the
effectiveness of short bombardment in some instances.
However, routine day and night patrols were made to
insure that blockade runners were not using North Korean
ports or landing areas, and to keep mineswept areas under
surveillance. In addition these forces supported naval
aircraft in the interdiction of east coast railroad and
highway systems within range of ships' gunﬁre; supported
minesweeping operations; supported troops ashore with
naval gunfire and destroyed enemy facilities and installa-
tions whenever the opportunity presented itself.
A United Nations Command battleship, three cruisers
and destroyers assigned rendered direct support for front
line ground forces at the eastern terminus of the bombline.
These gunﬁre support missions were conducted against
enemy strongpoints, gun positions, troop movements,
bunkers, supply areas, trenches and supply routes.
Harassing and interdiction ﬁre was provided nightly on
troop movements, rail and road junctions, supply areas
and other worthwhile military targets.
Although enemy coastal gun positions in the Wonsan
area were less active than during previous periods they
continued to pose a threat to United Nations Command
surface forces and to friendy-heid islands in that area.
Various units were ﬁred upon on numerous occasions but
without being hit. Surface units continued to harass these
gun positions daily with naval gunﬁre and air strikes
which were vectored in on the particularly troublesome
positions when weather permitted.
All United Nations Command naval units were ordered
to cease ﬁre on 27 July at 10001 except to return enemy
ﬁre or to answer calls for upport of United Nations Com-
mand ground forces. On 27 July at 22001, in accordance
with armistice agreements, the surface blockade was
lifted and the major task of east coast surface forces
became the evacuation of friendly-held islands north of the
demarcation zone.
Surveillance patrols south of the line of demarcation
were set up to cover within the three mile limit in order
to protect friendly shipping, guard against breaches or
incidents concerning the armistice agreement and pre-
vent inﬁltration.
On 29 July United Nations Command naval forces re
ceived a request to assist as practicable in the search and
rescue of an Air Force RB 50 and crew reported down in
the Sea of Japan. A cruiser, two helicopters and ﬁve de-
stroyers were ordered to proceed and pick up survivors.
Carrier based planes assisted in the search and a P2V,
on routine anti-submarine patrol, was diverted to the
scene to assist. An exhaustive search was conducted for
nearly twenty-four hours. A trawler, ﬁshing vessels, and
other small craft were sighted in the area. A lifeboat,
considerable wreckage and several oil slicks were de-
tected. One survivor was picked up.
Marine aircraft based in Korea struck the enemy with
one thousand eight hundred seventy-ﬁve combat sorties.
The major effort was directed against Communist front
line and supporting positions in an effort to counter an
apparent effort by the Communist forces to gain ground
along the front line prior to a possible armistice. Numer-
ous bunkers, gun and mortar positions, supply and per-
sonnel shelters and enemy strongpoints were destroyed on
these close support missions. An undetermined number
of casualties were inﬂicted on enemy troops. Although
bad weather greatly curtailed the interdiction effort supply
lines, troop and supply areas and other military targets
were struck almost daily. In addition, reconnaissance. in-
tercept and escort sorties were ﬂown throughout North
Korea.
United Nations carrier based aircraft operating of!
the Korean West Coast continued their strikes on enemy
targets from the front lines to the Chinnampo area. Mar-
ginal to non-operational weather reduced the effective
sorties ﬂown during the period. However, in spite of gen-
eral] y poor weather conditions. nearly ﬁve hundred sorties
were ﬂown. Attacks were pressed on the troop billeting
areas, transportation facilities, supply areas and gun po-
sitions throughout the Hwanghae Province. Many rail
cuts were inﬂicted on the main supply routes and a number
of railcars, bridges and trenches were destroyed. At-
tacks were also made on particularly troublesome gun po-
sitions. Attacks on enemy troop concentrations resulted in
the destruction of numerous buildings. Many troop cas-
ualties were also inﬂicted. After the armistice became
effective planes of this unit engaged in reconnaissance
and shipping surveillance ﬂights.
United Nations Command surface units operating of!
the west coast of Korea continued to enforce the blockade
of that coast south of latitude thirty-nine degrees and
thirty-ﬁve minutes north to prevent ingress or egress,
mining, or supply and reinforcement by sea. In addition
these forces successfully defended friendly-held islands;
supported friendly guerrilla activities and destroyed mili-
tary installations and other worthwhile targets of oppor-
tunity. Coastal communications, troOp concentrations,
gun positions and other coastal targets were harassed
almost daily by gunﬁre.
After the cease ﬁre the major task of west coast surface
vessels became the expeditious evacuation of personnel
and equipment from coastal islands in accordance with
paragraph 13b of the Armistice Agreement.
Coastal areas, anchorages and channels were maintained
free of mines by daily minesweeping operations and check
sweeps by United Nations Command mlnesweepers.
Patrol planes ﬂew one hundred ﬁfteen scheduled mis~
sions during the sixteen day period. These planes con-
tinued to support the United Nations Command effort
in Korea by conducting daily shipping surveillance, anti-
submarine and weather reconnaissance missions over the
waters surrounding Korea.
In order to implement the exchange of prisoners in
accordance with the armistice agreements United Nations
Command surface units were directed to begin the lifts
of Prisoners of War from the various camps to Inchon.
Three ships loaded with 2400 prisoners of war arrived at
Inchon on 30 July.
United Nations Command naval auxiliary vessels and
transports provided personnel lifts and logistic support
for the United Nations Command forces in Korea.
The last month of the Korean War witnessed a con-
certed effort against enemy airﬁeids on the part of the
United Nations Command Air Forces as the Communists
intensiﬁed their repair and utilization of these installa-
tions. By maintaining close surveillance of the major
ﬁelds, it was possible to immediately attack those that
showed signs of increased activity. Post-strike and sur-
veillance photography, accomplished on 27 July of thirty
ﬂeids, revealed that none were serviceable for jet aircraft
and that only Uiju possessed any aircraft which could
be considered serviceable. At this installation photog-
raphy showed eight possible serviceable aircraft in addi-
tion to nine possibly unserviceable (or dummy) aircraft.
Therefore, the Communists are now legally denied the
asset of a major offensive Air Force in North Korea during
the period of the armistice, just as they were forcefully
denied this capability throughout the Korean War, by the
