The State of the Union
Message of the President to the Congress (Emerpts)‘
Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the
Eighty-third Congress:
It is a high honor again to present to the Con-
gress my views on the state of the Union and to
recommend measures to advance the security, pros-
perity, and well-being of the American people.
All branches of this Government—and I ven-
ture to say both of our great parties—can support
the general objective of the recommendations I
make today, for that objective is the building of
a. stronger America. A Nation whose every citi-
zen has good reason for bold hope; where effort
is rewarded and prosperity is shared; where free-
dom expands and peace is secure—that is what I
mean by a stronger America.
Toward this objective a real momentum has been
developed. We mean to continue that momentum
and to increase it. We mean to build a better
future for this Nation.
Much for which we may be thankful has hap-
pened during the past year.
First of all we are deeply grateful that our sons
no longer die on the distant mountains of Korea.
Although they are still called from our homes
to military service, they are no longer called to
the ﬁeld of battle.
The Nation has just completed the most pros-
perous year in its history. The damaging effect
of inﬂation on the wages, pensions, salaries, and
savings of us all has been brought under control.
Taxes have begun to go down. The cost of our
Government has been reduced and its work pro-
ceeds with some 183,000 fewer employees; thus the
discouraging trend of modern governments to-
ward their own limitless expansion has in our case
' Dellvered on Jan. 7 (H. doc. 251, 83d Cong., 2d 8688.).

been reversed. The cost of armaments becomes
less oppressive as we near our defense goals; yet
we are militarily stronger every day. During the
year, creation of the new Cabinet Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare symboliZed the
Government’s permanent concern with the human
problems of our citizens.
Segregation in the armed forces and other Fed-
eral activities is on the way out. We have also
made progress toward its abolition in the District
of Columbia. These are steps in the continuing
effort to eliminate interracial difﬁculty.
Some developments beyond our shores have been
equally encouraging. Communist aggression,
halted in Korea, continues to meet in Indochina
the vigorous resistance of France and of the As-
sociated States, assisted by timely aid from our
country. In West Germany, in Iran, and in other
areas of the world, heartening political victories
have been won by the forces of stability and free-
dom. Slowly but surely, the free world gathers
strength. Meanwhile, from behind the Iron Cur-
tain, there are signs that tyranny is in trouble
and reminders that its structure is as brittle as
its surface is hard.
There has been in fact a great strategic change
in the world during the past year. That precious
intangible, the initiative, is becoming ours. Our
policy, not limited to mere reaction against crises
provoked by others, is free to develop along lines
of our choice not only abroad but at home. As a
major theme for American policy during the com-
ing year, let our joint determination be to hold
this initiative and to use it.
We shall use this initiative to promote three
broad purposes: First, to protect the freedom of
our people; second, to maintain a strong, growing
