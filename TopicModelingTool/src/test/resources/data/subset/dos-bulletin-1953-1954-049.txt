by the Foreign Oﬂice that our Legation must cease
the distribution of the American publication.
This publication was a small monthly bulletin
which sought to give its readers an accurate ic-
ture of American life and thought. The rst
issue appeared in October of this year; its circula-
tion was approximately 1,600 copies.
The text of the U.S. note is as follows:
The Secretary of State presents his compliments to
the Honorable the Minister of Romania and has the
honor to refer to the dissemination of publications within
the United States at the instance of the Rumanian Lega-
tion. Special reference is made to the periodical bulletin
entitled. The Romanian News.
As the Legation is doubtless aware, the Rumanian
Government has requested the American Legation at
Bucharest to cease further distribution in Rumania of
a periodical issued by that Legation entitled New; From
America.
Accordingly, the Department of State requests the
Rumanlan Legation to cease forthwith the publication
and distribution in the United States of The Romanian
News. The distribution in the United States by the
Rumanian Legation of other similar pamphlets published
at the expense of the Rumanian Government or its organs
should also be terminated.
Mutual Economic Progress in the Americas
by John M. Cabot
Assistant Secretary for Inter-American Affairs ‘
How much news regarding our sister American
nations does the public in the United States read?
And what kind of news?
If in recent years we have paid much more
attention to problems in the Old World than to
those of Latin America, our relations with our
sister republics of this hemisphere are none the
less vital to us. Since the Monroe Doctrine was
ﬁrst enunciated, we have considered it the most
fundamental princi le underlying our national
security that no pre atory foreign power establish
its sway in an part of this hemisphere. In this
shrunken world we live in, and in view of the
astonishing rowth and development of our sister
republics, w lat was essential to us in 1823 is cer-
tainly no lessiessential today.
Already the voices of our sister republics speak
with increasin authority in world councils and
contribute vita ly to the moral forces which West-
ern owllization is mustering to maintain peace and
securit in the face of the Communist menace.
With razil already sur assing the Latin nations
of the Old lVorld and t e New in population as
well as area, with Argentina, Mexico, Venezuela,
and our other sister re ublics developing so fast
that one can scarce cre it one’s eyes, the growing
stature of our sister republics is bound to be an
increasingly signiﬁcant factor in world affairs.
‘Address made before the Export-Import Club of the
Columbus Chamber of Commerce, Columbus, Ohio, on
Dec. 16 (press release 662).
If only in obvious self-interest, we must strive to
keep it as friendly a factor in the future as it has
been in the past.
Our economic relations are no less important.
Our $7 billion of trade with our sister re ublics
is greater than our commercial trade with “urope
or any other part of the world. Our $6 billion
of investments in Latin America surpass those in
any other single area except Canada. From Latin
America we get most of our coffee and foreign-
roduced sugar and many other products such as
bananas, cacao, wool, and tobacco; we also get
many materials which we needed for our victory
in lVorld lVar II, such as copper, tin, lead, zinc,
oil, and vanadium, and which, with the steady
depletion of our own national resources, we are
likely to need even more exigent] in the future.
In Latin American markets we se 1 some $31/2 bil-
lion of our products annually.
The interplay of our cultures enriches our lives
throughout the hemisphere. We on the balance
have made liberal exports not only of the autos,
movies, and bathtubs with which our culture is so
often disdainfully associated but also of political
ideas, books, education, science, medicine. In re-
turn, we have received paintin , architecture,
exotic dishes, dances, and the cu tural stimulus
which comes from so rich, varied. and different
cultures in lands so close to us. \Vhen you travel
