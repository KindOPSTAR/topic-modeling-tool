been taken is not intended in any way to be a
diminution of our recognition of responSibilities in
that area, or of our ability to discharge those
obligations.
Let me reaffirm what the President said, namely,
that United States military forces in the Far East
will be maintained at appropriate levels to take
account of the commitments which the United
States has undertaken in that area and which are
vital to the security of the United States. These
forces will feature highly mobile naval, air, and
amphibious units.
Viet Mlnh Penetration of Laos
Press release 678 dated December 29
At his rcss conference on December 29, Score-
tary Dul es was questioned regarding the signiﬁ-
cance of the Viet Minh enetration of Laos. Mr.
Dulles made the following reply:
My impression is that recent accounts have been
exaggerated. There has been talk about cutting
Indochina in two. The reality is that there has
not for a long time been any movement north and
south thron 'h that area. The normal movement
is by sea an by the river, and the interior has been
spotted with Communist inﬁltrations for a long
time. I imagine that the buildup which has been
'ven this is due in considerable part to its political
implication which exaggerates the matter beyond
its military si iﬁcance. I don’t know where the
source of this uildup comes from. My informa-
tion is that the French press has not attached as
much importance to it as apparently the American
press has. I don't know how to account for that
exactly, but it seems to be the fact. Certainly it
is a fact that our analysis does not attach the im-
portance to it which seems to be attached by many
of the stories.
“'e have always taken a serious view of the
entire situation in the Indochina area. It is a
difficult struggle. It is an area in which any side
which wishes to take an offensive can do so. But
my 'udgment of the total situation is not appre-
ciabfv affected by the Communist offensive in the
last ew days. I do not believe that anythin that
has happened upsets appreciably the timeta le of
General Navarre’s plan. There is no reason that
I am aware of for anybody to get panicky about
what has happened.
Now as to your questions of whether this de~
tracts from the sincerity of the highly publicized
“peace feelers” of the Viet Minh, whether this
penetration is coordinated with Communist moves
elsewhere, and whether it constitutes a threat to
Thailand, let me say this: With respect to the
“peace feelers,” I have never thought there was
much sincerity in them. So when you subtract
nothing from nothing, you still have nothing.
It is not impossible that this move bears a rela-
tionship to the prospective meeting of the Foreign
Ministers in Berlin.
The fact that Communist troops are again close
to the borders of Thailand obviously causes some
concern. But the Communist forces on the border
are not now, according to our information, in such
numbers as to carry any present serious threat to
Thailand.

between the U. S. and Soviet Governments regard-
in the proposed four-power meeting of Foreign
Mgnietera at Berlin. The U. S. note was delivered

Ambassador Charles E. Bohlrn. Similar notes
were delivered to the Foreign Ministry on behalf
of the British and French Governments.‘
U. 5. NOTE OF JANUARY 1

While regretting that the Soviet Government has
not acce ted the proposed date of January 4, the
United States Government agrees to the date of
January 25 now suggested in the Soviet note.
The United States Government also agrees that
representatives of the High Commissioners should
discuss the technical arrangements for the meet-

formerly used by the Allied Control Authority
offers all the necessary facilities.
In its earlier notes, the United States Govern-

sary to revert to these matters which will shortly
be the subject of discussion between the Foreign
Ministers of the four countries.
