service b a unilateral expropriation. The sover-
eign rig it of a nation to expropriate foreign
property in its jurisdiction cannot be questioned—
ut we do insist on prompt, adequate, and just
compensation. By the same token, an nation has
the undeniable sovereign right to dec are war on
any other nation if it so chooses, but it would
scarcely be argued that the exercise of such a sov-
erei n right would entail no international respon-
sibi ities. In other words, the question of the
treatment of foreign capital is not essentially one
of right, and it should not be considered in terms
of absolutes; it is a question of what is fair, what
is wise, what is practical, what is in the national
interest, what will preserve the international
comity.
It has been suggested that there is no capital in
the United States which would seek investment
abroad. How then ex lain the outﬂow of direct
ca ital investments to atin America of some $1.7
bi ion between 1946 and 1952? How explain that
our citizens made a net direct investment of over
$1 billion in Canada in the same span of years, not
to mention portfolio investments
It has been suggested that foreign capital milks
a country economically, leaving nothing for the
0 le. How then explain that some 70 percent of
(231i ean, some 97 ercent of Venezuelan and at
least 55 percent 0 Costa Rican exports are pro-
duced by foreign companies? \Vithout those ex-
ports what would become of those countries?
And can there be any really clear cases cited where
American companies have paid lower than re-
vailing wages, or provided poorer than stan ard
working conditions? Obviously they couldn’t get
workmen if they did; obviously the fact that they
do improves wages and working conditions.
It has been suggested that forei n capital tends
to dominate a country’s politica life. At the
present time there are American investments in
Canada of some $8 billion—considerably larger
than our investments in all Latin America, though
the po )ulation of Canada is less than one-tenth
that of Latin America. Our good neighbors to
the north would deeply resent and know to be
untrue any suggestion that our investments in-
ﬂuence their political life.
Is it altogether an accident that, while some $25
billion of foreign and domestic capital were being
invested in Canada in the years 1946 to 1952, per
capita income in the period 1939—52 tripled in
terms of dollars and rose 60 percent in terms of
goods. even though the average work week was
dropping from 48 to 43 hours? Is it without
signiﬁcance that Canada’s oil production, largely
developed by foreign capital, rose from 21,000
barrels daily in 1947 to 169,000 barrels in 1952 and
that in four years Canada thereby saved $300
million in foreign exchange?
Canada has wisely used native capital to the
greatest feasible extent but has not hesitated to use
foreign capital when this was convenient. The
new ca ital, native and foreign, invested in
Canada as helped the Canadian workman to rival
the American’s standard of living. May I add,
for people in the United States who think that the
development of foreign countries will hurt our
foreign trade, that Canada’s forei n trade in this
extraordinary period of internal evelopment has
risen b ﬁve times!
Fina ly, it is to be noted that Canada has had to
rant no special privileges to foreign capital.
Capital has flowed in because over the years and
decades it has learned to count on fair treatment.
That this has not been without its advantages for
Canada is suggested by the fact that the interest
rate on government bonds averages about 3 percent
as against 8—10 percent in most of Latin America.
That extra return is primarily the cost Latin
America pays because of the added risks which
foreign capital must face there.
In short, we can and should do several things
to help our sister republics in the economic sphere;
but for the most art their economic future rests
in their own ban 3.
If some of our Latin American friends say that
Canada is a special case I would invite their atten-
tion to Puerto Rico. Idere is a tiny land, increas-
ingly overpopulated, lacking in natural resources
and the elements for heavy industry. Despite a
long-standing law limiting landownership to 500
acres, sugar companies formerly controlled vastly
greater acreages. The sugar companies were
forced to divest themselves of their large land-
holdings—but they always obtained just com-
pensatlon.
A wise and energetic government has attracted
some 1,388 industries to the island in the ast 12
years; and the per capita income has tre led to
$400 per year, igher than that in most Latin
American republics. Puerto Rico roudly con-
siders itself a bridge between Nort and Latin
America; and certainly its economic experiences
mi ht be studied advantageously by nations with
sue similar problems. Its example has shown
what even a naturally handicapped economy can
do by prudent policies to raise living standards
and is being increasingly studied in other countries.
Communlst Attack on Capital
lVe must never forget that the Communists
attack capital in Latin America—and particularly
foreign capital—because, on the one hand, it is a
subject which lends itself to their false propa-
ganda and, on the other, they recognize that capi-
tal, by promoting national development and
raising living standards, is a potent enemy of their
agitation. There can be individual conﬂicts be-
tween capital and labor, between foreign com-
panies and national interests, but in general
cooperation and fair play between government,
capital, and labor are necessary to the interests of
each of them.
