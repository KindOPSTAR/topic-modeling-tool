of the administration and its recommendations
for congressional action. These will include ﬂex-
ible credit and debt management policies; tax
measures to stimulate consumer and business
spending; suitable lending, guaranteeing, insur-
ing, and grant-in-aid activities; strengthened old
age and unemployment insurance measures; im-
proved agricultural programs; public works plans
laid well in advance; enlarged opportunities for
international trade and investment. This enu-
meration of these subjects only faintly hints the
vast amount of study, coordination, and planning,
to say nothing of authorizing legislation, that
all together will make our economic preparedness
complete.
If new conditions arise that require additional
administrative or legislative action, the adminis-
tration will still be ready. A government always
ready to take well-timed and vigorous action, and
a business community willing, as ours is, to plan
boldly and with conﬁdence, can between them de-
velop a climate assuring steady economic growth.
Conclusion
I want to add a ﬁnal word about the general
purport of these many recommendations, which
are not in any sense exclusive. Others will from
time to time be submitted to the Congress.
()ur Government’s powers are wisely limited by
the Constitution; but quite apart from those limi-
tations there are things which no government can
do or should try to do.
A government can strive, as ours is striving, to
maintain an economic system whose doors are open
to enterprise and ambition—those personal qual-
ities on which economic growth largely depends.
But enterprise and ambition are qualities which
no government can supply. Fortunately no Amer-
ican government need concern itself on this score;
our people have these qualities in good measure.
A government can sincerely strive for peace, as
ours is striving, and ask its people to make sacri-
ﬁces for the sake of peace. But no government
can place peace in the hearts of foreign rulers.
So it is our duty to ourselves and to freedom it-
self to remain strong in all those ways—spiritual,
economic, military—that will give us maximum
safety against the possibility of aggressive action
by others.
No government can inoculate its people against
the fatal materialism that plagues our age. Hap-
pily, our people, though blessed with more mate-
rial goods than any pcople in history, have always
reserved their ﬁrst allegiance to the kingdom of
the spirit, which is the true source of that free-
dom we value above all material things.
But, ladies and gentlemen of the Congress, a
government can try, as ours tries, to sense the
deepest aspirations of the people and to express
them in political action at home and abroad. So
long as action and aspiration humbly and earn-
estly seek favor in the sight of the Almighty,
there is no end to America’s forward road; there
is no obstacle on it she will not surmount in her
march toward a lasting peace in a free and pros-
perous world.
