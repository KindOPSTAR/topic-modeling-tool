THE FOREIGN SERVICE



Resignation of Ambassador
Warren Lee Pierson
Press release 679 dated December 29
Following is an exchange of correspondence be-
tween Secretary Dulles and Warren Lee Pierson
u on the completion of Mr. Pierson’s work as
United States delegate to the Tripartite Commie-
n'on on German Debts:
Mary Dulles to Mr. Pierson
DECEMBER 23, 1953
Mr DEAR MR. Pmnson':
I have your letter of November 20, 1953 wherein
on submit your resignation as the United States
elegate to the Tri artite Commission on German
Debts, the work 0 which was concluded success-
fully u on the entry into force on September 16,
1953 0 a series of intergovernmental agreements
designed to settle Germany’s external debts.
When on were called upon to serve on the Tri-
partite ommission on German Debts it was not
expected that on would be required to devote so
much time and, effort to the work of the Commis-
sion. As the negotiations regressed, however,
conﬂicting interests arose an numerous problems
of a very complex nature developed. The fact that
settlement arrangements were ﬁnally worked out
which are satisfactory to all parties at interest and
which have reasonable prospects of fulﬁllment,
may be regarded as a truly remarkable achieve-
ment and a tribute to your able leadership of the
United States Delegation. The successful settle-
ment of this problem is a major step forward in the
attainment of our political objectives in Europe.
In view of the fact that the work of the Com-
mission has been completed, I accept your resigna-
tion as United States Delegate to the Tripartite
Commission on German Debts with the personal
rank of Ambassador.
Sincerely yours,
J oun F os'rsa DULLas
Mr. Pierson to Secretary Dulles

The Honorable
The Secretary of State
SIR:
I have the honor to submit herewith my resig-
nation as United States Delegate to the Tripartite
Commission on German Debts with the personal
rank of Ambassador, to which I was appointed
on June 16, 1951.‘
The Tri artite Commission on German Debts
was established by the Governments of the Re-
public of France, the United Kingdom of Great
ritain and Northern Ireland and the United
States of America in order to work out a general
aggeement for the settlement of German external
e ts.
The Commission held preliminary discussions
in June and July 1951 with representatives of
the Government of the Federal Republic of Ger-
many and with representatives from some of the
princi al creditor countries.
In ecember 1951 the Commission reached a
decision with the German Government on terms
for the settlement of claims of the three Govern-
ments for post-war economic aid furnished to
Germany.I
The Commission then summoned a general con-
ference which assembled in February 1952 at Lon-
don to consider a settlement of Germany’s pre-war
debts. Over 25 creditor countries were repre-
sented at the Conference and representatives of
private creditor groups also participated. In spite
of the great complexity of the problems which
faced the Conference and the number of interests
which had to be reconciled, a report was adopted
in August 1952 which received the unanimous
agreement of all the creditor interests involved.I
Thereafter a series of agreements were drawn
up based upon the recommendations of the Lon-
don Conference, which I signed on behalf of the
United States Government at London on February
27, 1953.“ The Agreements were submitted to the
United States Senate for its advice and consent
for ratiﬁcation.
I participated in the hearings before the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee in June 1953. The
