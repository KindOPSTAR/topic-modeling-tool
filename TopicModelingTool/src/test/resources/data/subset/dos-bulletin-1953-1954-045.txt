[Unoﬂicial translation]
The Soviet Government takes into consideration the
United States Government's agreement to the convocation
of a conference of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the
United States of America, England, USSR and France at
Berlin.
The Government of the USSR reafﬁrms the position
which it set forth earlier on the question of the convoca-
tion of a conference of Ministers of Foreign Affairs. It
views the importance of this conference in connection with
the possibility of the achievement of a lessening of tension
in international relations given appropriate desires on the
part of all participants in the conference and in connec-
tion with the necessity of assuring European security and
eliminating the threat of the rebirth of German militarism.
The Soviet Government takes note of the United States
Government‘s agreement to discuss the question of the
U. S. Continues Efforts Toward Return
of Lend-Lease Vessels by U. S. S. R.
Press release 676 dated December 38
Following are the texts of several communica-
tions exchanged between the Department of State
and the Embassy of the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics on lend-lease matters:
U. S. AIDE-MEMOIRE OF SEPTEMBER 11 1
On November 5, 1952 the Acting Secretary of
State addressed a note to His Excellency the
Ambassador of the Government of the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics 2 concerning the negoti-
ations for a settlement of the obligations of the
Soviet Government under the Master Lend-Lease
Agreement of June 11, 1942.8 In this note it was
pointed out that although the Soviet Government
ad expressed its readiness to return to the United
States 186 naval craft, the return of which the
Government of United States initially requested
in its note of Se tember 3, 1948 and repeatedly
requested therea ter, the Soviet Government had
not been prepared to take any concrete action for
this purpose. It was suggested that if it was in
fact the intention of the Soviet Government to
return those vessels, the Government of the United
States should be informed without further delay

convocation of a conference of five powers with participa-
tion of the Chinese People's Republic, inasmuch as the con-
ference of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the ﬁve powers
can naturally contribute in the highest measure to the
settlement of international problems which have come to
a head.
Taking into account the necessity for appropriate prep-
aration for the conference of Ministers of Foreign Affairs
and also the importance of assuring the proper conditions
for participation in this conference for all governments,
the Soviet Government considers the most suitable date
for such conference January 25, 1954, or any subsequent
day.
As to building where above-mentioned conference should
take place. it would appear expedient to decide this ques-
tion by agreement among the representatives of the High
Commissioners of the four powers in Berlin.
Similar notes have also been sent by the Soviet Govern-
ment to the Governments of England and France.
of the dates and ports of return, or alternatively
of the date when Soviet representatives would be
available to work out with representatives of the
Government of the United States the details for
the return of the vessels.
The Actin Secretary’s note also reiterated the
position of t 1e Government of the United States
with respect to the other lend-lease vessels remain-
ing in the custod of the Soviet Government. As
had been made c ear in the United States notes of
April 6, 1951 ‘ and January 7, 1952 5 and in meet-
ings of the lend-lease delegations of the two Gov-
ernments since January 1951, the offers of the
Government of the United States early in the set-
tlement negotiations to sell lend-lease merchant
vessels and a number of lend-lease naval craft were
expressly conditioned u on the prompt conclu-
sion of a satisfactory len -lease settlement. When
in January 1951 the Soviet Government had not
arrived at a settlement of its lend-lease obligations
the Government of the United States withdrew
these offers and requested the return of all lend-
lease vessels. Furthermore, it had become un-
mistakably clear from the history of the negotia-
tions that the Soviet Government had consistently
avoided the conclusion of a prompt settlement.
With respect to the question of a ﬁnancial settle-
ment the note of the Acting Secretary recalled
that the Government of the United States had
oﬂ'ered to accept the sum of $800 million which it
