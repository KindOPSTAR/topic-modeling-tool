the Swedish and Swiss s. I ave
a so read the accompanyin communications indi-
cating the manner in whic failure to agree to a
single point developed. Of the two reports, I ﬁnd
that prepared by the Swedish and Swiss delega-
tions much more objective, factual and indicative
of the operations of the Neutral Nations Repatria-
tion Commission.
In view of the fact that the 90-day period for
explanations has now terminated, and because the
issues during this phase of Neutral Nations Repa-
triation Commission operations have been so
clearly identiﬁed by both reports, I see little posi-
tive value to be gained by expressing detailed
opinions on such issue. However, in order to
clarify unmistakably the position of the United
Nations Command on what I consider to be certain
key elements, I am constrained to submit once
more a reiteration of certain salient points:
A. The United Nations Command categorically
denies any implication that we have attempted, in
any way, to exercise control to the slightest degree
over prisoners in the south camp by the intro-
duction of agents provocateur, or that we have
attempted to maintain any type of covert intel-
ligence network.
gations and the interim report dprepared and si ed
elegation
B. The allegation that prisoners alone in the south
camp were responsible for the failure to complete
explanations I ﬁnd totally unacceptable. Al-
though the United Nations Command had no
permanent representation in either the Neutral
Nations Repatriation Commission or custodian
force, India, it appears clearly obvious from re-
ports received from our duly authorized liaison,
observation and explainer personnel, as well as
from official statements of the Neutral Nations
Repatriation Commission itself, that the primary
causes of failure were due to:
(1) The severe disappointment of the representa-
tives of the Korean People’s Army and the
Chinese People’s Volunteers at their inability to
secure more than a nominal percentage of re-
turnees from groups receiving explanations.
(2) The delaying tactics adopted by Korean
People’s Army and Chinese People’s Volunteers
including:
(A) Unreasonable and changing demands for
facilities.
(B) Refusal to accept reasonable numbers of
willing prisoners for explanations during each
a .
(C); Refusal of Korean People’s Army and
Chinese People’s Volunteers to utilize available
explaining time unless the Neutral Nations Re-
patriation Commission and Custodian Force,
India conformed to all their demands which in-
cluded the use of force and other impracticable
actions.
C. The United Nations Command, on the other
hand, supports fully the stronv stand taken by the
Indian, Swedish and Swiss Ilelegations prohib-
iting the use of force against defenseless prisoners.
D. The terms of reference plainly specifv that ex-
planations would be terminated as of 23 ecember
1953. We therefore cannot accept any alternate
proposal which may be made by any other agency
on this point, just as we shall not acce t any other
roposal WhlCh amends the date 22 anuary, the
ast day upon which prisoners in Neutral Nations
Repatriation Commission custody can be denied
their freedom.
E. The termination date of custody, 22 January
1954, 120 days after the Neutral Repatriation
Commission originally assumed custody, is ﬁxed
and does not de end on the holding of any politi-
cal conference, t e holding of which was, by terms
of the armistice agreement, to be recommended
to their respective governments by the command-
ers of each side in the Korean conﬂict.
With s eciﬁc reference to that part of your letter
of 28 ecember 1953 (forwarding the aforemen-
tioned reports) which discusses the action to be
taken by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Com-
mission now that the ex lanation period has
ended and no political con erence is in session, I
believe the foregoing views are sufficiently clear
to serve as a basis for a sound and logical course
of action. As of 230001 1 January 1954, risoners
now in custod of the Neutral Nations epatria-
tion Commission, having then become entitled to
civilian status are free to move to destinations of
their choice. For those who wish to be assisted
by the United Nations Command I suggest that
they be moved south in orderly, manageable
groups and according to a phased schedule, so
that they may be received at a mutually agreed
upon location along the southern boundary of the
demilitarized zone. The United Nations Com-
mand is fully prepared to receive them and aid
them to move to destinations of their choice to
settle into peaceful civilian pursuits.
For those who may apply to go to neutral nations,
the United Nations Command (as previously out-
lined to you) stands ready to assist the Neutral
Nations Repatriation Commission in care and dis-
position during the period 22 J anuary—21 Febru-
ary. Whether we can continue assistance after 21
February will depend upon the situation then pre-
vailing; I can, however, assure you of our coopera-
tion insofar as practicable in my capacity as a
military commander.
With assurances of my continued esteem, I am,
sincerely yours, J. E. HULL, General, United States
Army, Oom/mander-z'n-Uhief.
