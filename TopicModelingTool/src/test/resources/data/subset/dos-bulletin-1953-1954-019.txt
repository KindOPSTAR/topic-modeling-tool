concrete bunkers and tunnels in the north leads
us to believe they have no wish to resume hostilities
but are reparing to hold the north.
Will resident Rhee unilaterally resume hos-
tilities? In my judgment the answer is “no.”
President Rhee is an indomitable ﬁ hter for a
free, united, and democratic indepen ent Korea.
Those are our objectives and of the United Na-
tions. We admire his patriotism and courage and
his ﬁght against communism tremendously.
We have signed the armistice and are deter-
mined to keep it. On August 7, 1953, President
Rhee and Secretar Dulles signed a joint com-
munique in which resident Rhee agreed to leave
his troops under the United Nations Command
and to take no unilateral action until the mutual
defense pact might be expected to come into opera-
tion next spring if approved by the Senate.“ In
view of his talks with Secretary Dulles, Assistant
Secretary of State Robertson, and Vice President
Nixon and my many talks with him on this subject
I believe President Rhee will take no unilateral
action.
IVhat is the argument all about? Why can’t we
and the Communists agree on the time, place, and
composition of the conference?
Time and place are relatively easy. As to time,
we are agreeable to any date so long as there is
adequate time to prepare the necessa facilities,
transport the delegations, etc. As to p ace, we say
Geneva, the Communists say New Delhi, and we
could probably agree on Beirut, or Colombo or
Kandy or N uwara Eliya in Ceylon.
Problem of Conference Composltlon
The meat of the coconut is the composition.
Who will attend the conference—Who will be
bound by agreements reached? Can we bring
about uniﬁcation of Korea and the withdrawal of
foreign forces?
With regard to composition, although the armi-
stice does not so prowde, the other side roposed
we should invite ﬁve neutrals, inclu in the
USSR. as one of them, with the same rig ts to
participate in the discussions and to vote as the
nations on the two sides. They include the
U.S.S.R. among these truly neutral nations pre-
sumably to hide her aggression in Korea. The
USSR. cannot be class1ﬁed with such trul ﬁne
neutrals as Burma, India, Indonesia, and aki-
stan. We have said the U.S.S.R. can attend pro-
vided the other side wants her.
It is readily apparent why the USSR. is not
a neutral and why it would be desirable to have
her at the conference and to know her attitude on
each agenda item at the conference—whether she
agreed with the other side and whether she will
be bound by any agreements reached.
Why do the Communists want neutrals? The
' I bid., Aug. 17, 1953, p. 203.
Communists think they can stir up trouble for us
with India by nominating her as a neutral at the
conference. They want well-intentioned eople
to believe that the Government of the United
States does not like India, its great leader, or its
freedom-loving people, which is fantastic.
Let me here pay tribute to a great milita man,
a great humanitarian, and a man com ining
su erb common sense with patience and a warm
friendly feeling for the helpless prisoners of war—
General Thimayya of India, Chairman of the
Neutral Nations Re atriation Commission. I be-
lieve that General ¥himayya is in full sympathy
with our desire to observe the unalterable clock-
work timetable of the agreement for the release of
the prisoners of war.
Release at War Prisoners
If the political conference is in session December
22 to January 22, it can discuss until that date but
no longer the disposition of risoners who have
not elected repatriation to tﬁ)e country of their
origin. It cannot discuss that question longer
than January 22. If it is not in session that does
not affect by one jot the automatic operation of the
time schedule for the release of prisoners.
On midnight, Januar 22, unless both sides ask
them to remain, the Indian forces will withdraw
and the prisoners will be assisted to a neutral
countr . We have assured General Thimayya
our si e will not so request.
I think there is reason to hope that there will
be no action either by the Communists or the Re-
public of Korea to cause bloodshed and that the
prisoners will revert to civilian status on January
22 without diﬂiculty or trouble.
To stop the other side’s byplay as to neutrals
and to further the early convening of the confer-
ence, our side has put forward an overall con-
structive proposal for the participation at the
conference of neutrals as nonvotin observers on
the items on the agenda as agree between the
two voting sides and in the order of discussion as
agreed upon.6 This would permit India and the
others to participate as nonvoting observers and
to discuss items on the agreed agenda and in the
agreed order. If an item is not on the agenda it
cannot be discussed. Nor can items be brought up
out of their agreed order.
Except for the other side’s insistence on the
USSR. participating as a neutral, and ironing
out the particular neutrals to participate which
really constitutes no fundamental difficulty, we
have fully met the other side on this question as
to the participation of nonvoting observers and
their rights at the conference and voting pro-
cedures.
As to voting, each side votes as a unit. But
