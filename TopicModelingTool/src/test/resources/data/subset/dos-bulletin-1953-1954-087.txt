Crown Colony of Hong Kong, Foa over the week-
end authorized $150,000 out of its Esca ee Pro-
gram funds toward the procurement o shelter,
food, and medical care for the homeless.
The funds are being made available to the relief
authorities in Hong Kong through the United
States Consul General there. The British Gov-
ernment in Hong Kong has already provided £200,-
000 ($500000) for disaster relief. Other action
alread ta en by the free world to alleviate the dis-
tress o escapees from Red China includes a $10,000
gift from the Pope, in addition to efforts by various
voluntary agencies.
President Eisenhower and the United States
Congress have lon recognized the need for assist-
ance to refugees w 0 have ﬂed the Soviet orbit in
ursuit of a. life that can be lived in freedom and
uman dignity. When a catastro he such as the
Christmas ﬁre at Hong Kong stri es, it is a true
expression of the humanity of the people of the
United States to relieve suﬂering by helpin to
provide food, shelter, and medical care for ree-
dom-loving eople in distress. I am conﬁdent that
these United) States funds will bring substantial
help to the refugees from Red China and give them
new hope as the new year begins.
FOA received $9 million this year for the ad-
ministration of the escapee and refugee program
for relief and resettlement throu hout the world.
The major efforts to date have en in Western
Europe and the Near East. This is the second re-
glrlit use of funds to assist refugees from Red
ina.
India’s Railway System
To Receive FOA Aid
India’s railway system, vital to communications
within the country, will receive 100 new loco-
motives and 5,000 new freight cars as part of
United States economic aid to India in the current
ﬁscal year, it was announced on December 28 by
the Foreign Operations Administration.
An agreement signed in New Delhi by repre-
sentatives of the Foa Mission to India and the
Government of India calls for expenditures of $20
million of US. funds and 32 million rupees
(about $6.73 million) on the project. The Indian
Government will deposit the equivalent of $20
million in rupees in a fund to be used on further
development projects agreed to by the Indian and
American Governments.
United States funds will go for urchase of the
locomotives and freight cars outsi e of India. It
is expected that bids will be received from most
countries of the free world having facilities to
manufacture railroad rolling stock. Rupee costs
will be used for ocean transportation to India,
handling costs and assembly of freight cars im—
ported under the agreement.
The project is part of the rehabilitation of
Indian railroads under India’s Five Year Plan.
With 34,123 miles of track, the Indian railways
system is the fourth largest in the world exceeded
only by the United States, the Soviet Union, and
Canada. The system carries 80 ercent of internal
freight trafﬁc and 70 percent of) passenger trafﬁc.
It employs more than 900,000 persons. The aver-
age daily number of trains is 3,877 and the number
of passengers carried more than three million.
Because of the pressure of traﬁic on available facili-
ties, the passenger system is probably the most
crowded in the world.
Indian railways have been in operation 100
years. The present situation, calling for replace-
ment of many over-age locomotives, arises largely
from the strains placed on the system in World
War 11. Despite a large increase in volume of
traﬁic, Indian railways, even with their own
shortages, released a large number of locomotives
and cars for various theaters of war, abroad as
well as in India.
Under the 5-year development plan, India has
already placed orders for 769 locomotives and will
place orders for 500 or more during the last 2 years
of the plan. Similarly orders have been placed
for 32,293 new freight cars already, and 29,000
more will be ordered in the last 2 years of the plan.
By March 1956, however, some 3,600 locomotives
will be over 40 years old. It is estimated that once
the accumulated arrears of repairs and replace-
ments are overtaken, the resent level of trafﬁc
can be moved with about ,800 locomotives with
an average age of 20 years. At this level, replace-
ment requirements will be about 200 locomotives
a year, well within the productive capacity of
India’s two locomotive plants.
Some 73,000 freight cars are over-aged already
or will be during the period of the Five Year Plan.
The normal annual requirement, once arrears are
cleared, would be about 6,000 cars and this also
can be met from present manufacturing capacity.
The element of railway transport is closely in—
volved with other sectors of the economic devel-
opment program now under way in India. Food
grains, other a ,ricultural products and mineral
products inclu ing coal, manganese, and other
ores, make up 60 ercent of the freight tonnage
of the railways. ﬂicient trans ort is imperative
not only for the sustenance and development of
the country but for maintenance of essential ex-
ports to foreign countries.
American aid to India in the past 2 years has
been devoted primarily to measures to increase
agricultural production, a top priority area of the
Five Year Plan. This has included import of
fertilizer, along with technical assistance for ex-
pansion of India’s own new Sindri fertilizer plant,
the biggest in Asia. It has also included import
of iron and steel for farm implements, to aug-
ment India’s own steel output, and projects for
drilling irrigation wells, adding to the thousands
already in existence.
