these vessels offered for sale to the Soviet Govern-
ment. Furthermore, Article V of the Lend-Lease
A ement of J une 11, 1942 provides uncondition-
al y that the Soviet Government shall return lend-
lease articles to the United States when requested
to do so b the President of the United States.
According y the return of lend-lease vessels re-
quested by the President of the United States is not
an issue for negotiation nor can it be made depend-
ent u n the resolving of other questions in the
lend- ease negotiations.
It is the position of this Government, therefore,
that the ﬁrst step should be the working out of de-
tailed arrangements for the return of the 186 naval
craft. In this connection, the United States work-
ing oup previously designated for this purpose
willie prepared to meet at the earliest convenience
of the Soviet representatives. Following the
working out of such arran ments the two Govern-
ments should be prepare to take up the remain-
ing matters under the Lend-Lease Agreement.

religious, anti-Communist, and Hwngarian organ-
izations held in New York, N. Y., on December 27

I am very lad to have the opportunity of
addressing a rief message to the assembly of
persons meeting in observance of the ﬁfth anni-
versary of the imprisonment of Cardinal Joseph
Mindszenty of Hungary.
It is ﬁtting and roper that a large body of our
citizens and their riends from abroad, represent-

is actively fore the conscience of his countrymen
and that of free people throughout the world.
The prolongation of his unjust incarceration adds
daily to the moral poverty of his captors.
