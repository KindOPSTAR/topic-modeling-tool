ment A/C.1/L.92. In view of this fact and since
the revised draft resolution commands we believe,
wide support among the members of this commit-

not press for a vote on the amendments which we
submitted.
ICJ To Advlse on Relation
of Assembly and Tribunal
Statement by James P. Richards
U .8. Representative to the General Assembly
U.S. delegation press release dated December 8
The Fifth Committee has voted to refer to the
International Court of Justice certain legal ques-
tions pertaining to the relationship of the Assem-
bly and the Administrative Tribunal. I consider
this to be in lar e part a recognition of the position
taken by the gUnited States dele ation on the
matter of the Tribunal awards 1 an the power of
the Assembly to reject them. The referral to the
Court means that the awards will not be paid
now—and further consideration of them b the
Assembly will be postponed until after the ourt
gives its advisory opinion on the legal questions
ut to it. If the Court answers these questions as
Ithink it will, then I feel certain that the Assem-
bly will reject the awards at its next session.
