lion bushels durin the period from December
10 1953, to Septem r 30, 1954.1
In communicating its decision to this Govern-
ment the Canadian Government had indicated
that its action in limiting shipments of oats to the
United States was taken with the expectation that
substantial quantities of oats would not enter the
United States from other sources and thus displace
the com )etitive osition of Canada which has tra-
ditionally supp ied almost the whole of United
States imports of oats. Accordingly, the action
by the President in limitin imports from other
sources is su plementary to t e Canadian decision.
Taken toget ier, the two actions will have the ef-
fect of treatin imports of oats from all sources
on an equitable asis.
TEXT OF PROOLAMATION 3041'

Wnnarzas, Pursuant to Section 22 of the Agricultural
Adjustment Act, as added by Section 31 of the Act of
August 24, 1935, 49 Stat. 773, re-enacted by Section 1 of
the Act of June 3, 1937, 50 Stat. 246, and as amended by
Section 8 of the Act of July 3, 1948. 62 Stat. 1248, Section
3 of the Act of June 28, 1950, 64 Stat. 201, and Section
8 (ii) of the Act of June 16, 1951, 65 Stat. 72 (7 U. S. C.
624), the Secretary of Agriculture has advised me that he
has reason to believe that oats are being or are prac-
tically certain to be imported into the United States under
such conditions and in such quantities as to reader or
tend to render ineﬁ'ectlve, or materially interfere with,
the price-support program undertaken by the Department
of Agriculture with respect to oats pursuant to Sections
301 and 401 of the Agricultural Act of 1949 ((13 Stat.
1053, 1054), or to reduce substantially the amount of
products processed in the United States from domestic
oats with respect to which such program of the Depart-
ment of Agriculture is being undertaken; and
anus, on June 6, 1953, 1 caused the United States
Tariff Commission to make an investigation under the
said Section 22 with respect to hulled and unhulled oats
and unhulled ground oats ; and
\VliEREAB, the said Tariff Commission has made such
investigation and has reported to me its ﬁndings and
recommendations made in connection therewith; and
\VHEREAS, on the basis of the said investigation and
report of the Tariff Commission, I ﬁnd that hulled and
unhulled oats and unhulled ground oats are practically
certain to be imported into the United States during the
period December 23, 1953, to September 30, 1954, inclusive,
under such conditions and in such quantities as to render
or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with,
the said pricesupport program with respect to oats; and
“'ilI-ZREAB, 1 ﬁnd and declare that the imposition of
quantitative limitations not in excess of 23,000,000 bushels
of the product of Canada and not in excess of 2,500,000
bushels of the product of other foreign countries are
shown by such investigation of the Tariff Commission to
be necessary in order that the entry, or withdrawal from
warehouse, for consumption of oats described in the pre-
ceding paragraph of this Proclamation during the period
December 23. 1953, to September 30, 1954, will not render
or tend to render ineffective. or materially interfere with,
the said price-support program: and I further ﬁnd and
declare such permissible total quantity to be propor-
tionately not less than 50 percentum of the total average
aggregate annual quantity of such oats entered, or with-
