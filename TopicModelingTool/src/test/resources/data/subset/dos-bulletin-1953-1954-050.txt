jestic scenery, and ni htclubs; consciously or un-
consciously you are inking also of the colorful
civilizations of the lands ou are visiting. May I
add that, as traveling am assadors, I hope you see
to it that you are good ones.
I shall not dilate further on the basic impor-
tance of Latin America to us. Everyone in the
United States is aware of it; everyone wants
friendly relations with our sister republics. The
difﬁculty is that, like the sky, sea, and air of a
beautiful day, we are at times not as inclined as
we should be to think about it and appreciate it.
Just because we don’t have to argue about it, let us
nonetheless never forget it.
For from the moment you drink your morning
coffee—blended Brazilian and Colombian or other
milds—til] your wife opens for supper a can coated
with tin from Bolivia, Latin America is always
with you. If on don’t slee in a brass bed made
from copper rom Chile, t 1e oil to produce the
electricity for your home may come from Vene-
zuela, the lead for your automobile battery from
Mexico, the sugar for your cereal from Cuba, your
bananas from Costa Rica, and that nice rum in the
cocktails before dinner from Haiti. The soft
scarf vou’re wearin may well have some alpaca
wool rom Peru, an quite possibly your suit some
Uruguayan wool. On these cold, dark winter
mornings you may step out of bed onto a carpet
made of Argentine wool. And your child may
take with his school lunch a chocolate bar made
of Ecuadoran cacao.
Dependence on Letln Amerleen Products
And do not forget that your job may depend
on these and other im orts from Latin America.
Antimony isn‘t a very arge import in value—only
some $3.2 million in 1952—but we imported nearly
80 rcent of it in that year from Latin America
an it is a vital defense item. The manganese
ore we get from our sister republics—some 2.2 mil-
lion pounds in 1952—may not be large in value,
but remember that we can’t make steel without
manganese.
In short, your well-being here in Ohio de ends
very signiﬁcantly on our relations with tin
America. Without it, many of your great fac-
tories would be crippled. If on could et many
materials at all, it would be on y at sharpIy higher
prices. Your breakfast table without coffee and
sugar would be dreary indeed, but how would you
like your ho to have to ﬁght without the arms
made with tin American materials?
Let us glance at our relations with Latin Amer-
ica on an individual basis, for, after all, our rela-
tions with our sister republics are determined by
the 160 million individuals in the United States
and the roughly equal number in Latin America.
The western wool grower, to take a speciﬁc ex-
ample, is in competition with the Uruguayan wool
grower. Though existing duties add to the cost of
the suits you and I are wearin , the domestic wool
grower naturally enough from is viewpoint wants
more protection. Perha 5 he is just facing cut
proﬁts, but perhaps he is facing real loss—the
need for getting out of an un roﬁtable business.
Now, no one likes to see tiat domestic wool
grower hurt. We must nonetheless remember that
we did not grow into the greatest economic power
on earth b preserving high-cost production.
Within the nited States no protection is possible
against more efﬁcient production in other sections
of the country. In New England our econom has
had to go throu h four stages since colonial times.
It is our prong boast that we have no natural
resources except rocks and ice—and that we
exported them both! Modern technology has
stricken even these items from our ex ort list.
Today the textile era in New England is ollowing
the farming and shipping eras into history—but
New England is still rosperous.
Surely this examp e—which has brought loss
and misery to quite a few individuals yet healthy
growth to New England as a whole—nevertheless
as a lesson for the country. The New England
farmer, textile worker, and investor may have suf-
fered temporarily, but the country at large has
cheaper and more abundant food and clothin .
Moreover, within our great economy it is possibﬁa
to ada t oneself to changin conditions.
But at us look at the position of the Uruguayan
wool rower. His is a democratic country—a
staunc friend in two world wars and in many
ideological battles; but it is a small country whose
obvious natural resources are largely agricultural
as in New England, and it does not have the ad-
vantage of eat domestic markets. The national
economy is uilt on wool—which constitutes about
50 percent of Uruguayan exports. If we do not
raise the tariff on wool, it may be tough for the
domestic wool grower. If we do, it may be tough
not only on the Uruguayan wool grower as an
individual; it may be disastrous for Uruguay as a
nation. It may also decrease sales in Uruguay of
auto tires and jeeps and steel and cash registers
and electrical goods and a lot of other things made
in Ohio. A protective tariﬂ' may shield individ-
ual domestic producers from hurt; but it will do
this only at the hurt of other domestic producers.
If we cut of! imports of Uruguayan wool or
Chilean copper or Venezuelan oil or Bolivian tin
or Mexican lead or Cuban sugar or Peruvian tuna,
we shall simply reduce their purchases from us by
the same amount. They can buy from us only
what they sell to us.
Let us turn to the Bolivian tin miner. His job
notably contributes to your wife's convenience
when she prepares your supper; it also contributes
an element essential to war production, for ex-
ample of engine bearings. Twice in the past 15
years he has been asked to produce a vital ingredi-
ent to keep the free world free. As virtually the
