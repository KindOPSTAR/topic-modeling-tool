general, tried to present as dismal a picture as possible
for the (‘ommunlst photographers who were conveniently
on hand. Positive evidence that the United Nations Com-
mand had provided adequate food and medical care for
all the prisoners at war in its custody was plain for all
to see. and was duly recorded by press representatives.
In spite of all the difﬁculties and obstacles placed in
the United Nations Command path by the returning hard
core Communists, the United Nations Command handled
its portion of the exchange with patience and ﬁrmness.
liy the end of the period of this report. a total of 29.830
prisoners in United Nations Command custody had been
returned to Communist control.
Meanwhile, as those United Nations Command repatri-
ates from Communist control began telling their indi-
vidual stories, it became increasingly clear that the
enemy had taken every measure possible to instill in
the minds of their captives that the United Nations, and
especially the United States, had started the war. The
conditions of the ﬁrst returnees bore mute evidence of
the inadequate and often brutal treatment United Nations
t'ommand prisoners had suffered at the hands of the
Communists. By 15 August. the following numbers of
United Nations Command personnel had been released
from Communist captivity and were well on their way
to home and loved ones:
United States . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 957
Other United Nations . . . . . . . . . . . 693
Republic of Korea . . 2,726
Total . . 4,870
At 2200 hours on 27 July, the order to cease ﬁre was
complied with by United Nations Command divisions
along the entire battle front and withdrawal to new de-
fensive positions south of the Demilitarized Zone was
bonn-
Seventy-two hours after the cessation of hostilities all
United Nations Command troops had withdrawn south of
the zone. Subsequently unarmed tr00ps returned to the
southern half of the Demilitarlzed Zone to clear mine
ﬁelds and other hazards to the safe movement of personnel
of the Military Armistice Commission and its Joint 0b-
server Teams. Other unarmed troops were engaged in
salvaging equipment, and marking the southern border of
the Demilitarized Zone. These operations continued
throughout the period.
Meanwhile, south of the zone United Nations Command
troops were expeditiously re-establlshiug their new lines
of defense and instituting a training programme designed
to maintain a high degree of morale and combat readiness.
In accordance with the Armistice Agreement all hostili-
ties ceased and the United Nations Naval Blockade of the
Korean Coast was terminated at 2200 on 27 July. One
of the immediate tasks of the United Nations Naval Forces
became the evacuation of the coastal islands of Korea.
0n 2 August, United Nations Command Naval Forces re-
ported that the withdrawal of personnel, supplies and
equipment had been completed from all islands north of
the southern boundary of the Demllltarized Zone off the
east coast of Korea and from islands lying to the north
and west of the provincial boundary line between Iiwang-
hae Do and Kyouggi-Do off the west coast except the
island groups of I'aengyong D0, Taechong Do, Sochong
Do, Yonpyoug Do (including Kunyonpyong Do and Soyong-
yong Do), and U-Do which are to remain under the mili-
tary control of the (‘ommander-in-Chief United Nations
Command.
The basic concept of all United Nations Naval operations
in the ﬁrst post Armistice ﬁfteen-day period has been that
of maintaining forces in position to counter immediately
further aggression or attack; conduct training exercises,
and achieve a high state of material readiness. Immedi-
ately following the signing of the Armistice, units not
required in execution of initial tasks or in operating areas
adjacent to Korea were placed in a maintenance status.
United Nations Naval aircraft operating from fast at-
tack carriers in the Sea of Japan conducted intensive
training exercises, maintained an alert state of readiness.
and at all times complied with the provisions of the
Military Armistice Agreement. One thousand and one
hundred seventy-eight sorties were ﬂown during the period.
The largest percentage of these were training ﬂights.
During this period the feasibility of obtaining a marked
impact area in East Korea to he used for training purposes
was investigated. At the close of the period an area was
under preparation and will be available about 1 September.
A United Nations Command carrier has been selected
as a helicopter landing platform in order to lift approxi-
mately 5000 Indian troops from Inchon to the Dem"-
itarlzed Zone. The troops are scheduled to arrive at
Inchon by ship from 1 through 26 September. The troops
will then be transferred to the carrier by landing craft
thence to the Demllltarized Zone by Army and Marine
helicopters.
Patrols were established and have been conducted of!
the Korean West Coast to seaward of the Han River
Estuary under supervision and south of thirty-seven
degrees thirty-ﬁve minutes north latitude for protection
of the friendly coast. Patrols oi! the Korean East Coast
were established and executed from the eastern terminus
of the southern boundary of the Demilitarized Zone to 127
degrees east longitude. No signiﬁcant events were
observed at any time.
Planes from the First Marine Air Wing based in Korea
conducted intensive training exercises during the period.
In addition ﬁfty-four intercept and day and night patrol
sorties were ﬂown. No signiﬁcant activity was reported.
United Nations Naval patrol planes continued their
aerial reconnaissance of the Japan and Yellow Seas.
These planes ﬂew one hundred seven sorties during the
period. conducting daily shipping surveillance, anti-sub-
marine and weather reconnaissance missions over the
water surrounding Korea. In addition. these planes sup-
ported and engaged in special training exercises as
directed.
In order to meet the sixty-day deadline for the comple-
tion of “BIG SWITCH" as agreed to by the United Na-
tions in the Armistice Agreement. embarkation of prison-
ers of war in ships specially crihhed for this purpose began
on 28 July. The importance of this operation is shown. to
some extent, by the fact that ten ships otherwise sched-
uled to return to the United States were retained to
accomplish this task.
As of 15 August the United Nations Command had lifted
