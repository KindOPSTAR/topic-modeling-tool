economy; third, to concern ourselves with the hu-
man problems of the individual citizen.
Only by real progress toward attainment of
these purposes can we be sure that we are on the
road to a better and a stronger America. All my
recommendations today are in furtherance of these
three purposes.
Forelgn Attaln
Because our position as a sovereign nation in re-
lationship to other sovereign nations overshadows
and inﬂuences every other problem to which this
Government falls heir, it is appropriate that I
should start my speciﬁc discussions with the sub-
ject of foreign affairs.
American freedom is threatened so long as the
world Communist conspiracy exists in its present
scope, power, and hostility. More closely than
ever before, American freedom is interlocked with
the freedom of other people.
In the unity of the free world lies our best
chance to reduce the Communist threat without
war. In the task of maintaining this unity and
strengthening all its parts. the greatest responsi-
bility falls to those who, like ourselves, retain the
most freedom and the most strength.
We shall, therefore, continue to advance the
cause of freedom on foreign fronts.
In the Far East, we retain our vital interest in
Korea. We have negotiated with the Republic of
Korea a mutual security pact which develops our
security system for the Paciﬁc. I shall promptly
submit it to the Senate for its consent to ratiﬁca—
tion. We are prepared to meet any renewal of
armed aggression in Korea.
We shall maintain indeﬁnitely our bases in
Okinawa. I shall ask the Congress to authorize
continued material assistance to hasten the success-
ful conclusion of the struggle in Indochina. This
assistance will also bring closer the day when the
Associated States may enjoy the independence
already assured by France. We shall continue
military and economic aid to the Nationalist Gov-
ernment of China.
In South Asia, profound changes are taking
place in free nations which are demonstrating their
ability to progress through democratic methods.
They provide an inspiring contrast to the dictato-
rial methods and backward course of events in
Communist China. In these continuing efforts,
the free peoples of South Asia can be assured of
the support of the United States.
In the Middle East, where tensions and serious
problems exist, we will show sympathetic and
impartial friendship.
In Western Europe our policy rests ﬁrmly on
the North Atlantic Treaty. It will remain so based
as far ahead as we can see. Within its organiza-
tion, the building of a united European commu-
nity, including France and Germany, is vital to a
free and self-reliant Europe.
This will be promoted by the European Defense
Community, which offers assurance of European
security. With the coming of unity to \Vestern
Europe, the assistance this Nation can render for
the security of Europe and for the entire free
world will be multiplied in effectiveness.
In the Western Hemisphere, we shall continue
to develop harmonious and mutually beneﬁcial co-
operation with our neighbors. Indeed, solid
friendship with all our American neighbors is a
cornerstone of our entire policy.
In the world as a whole, the United Nations,
admittedly still in a state of evolution, means much
to the United States. It has given uniquely valu-
able services in many places where violence threat-
ened. It is the only real world forum where we
have the opportunity for international presenta-
tion and rebuttal.
It is a place where the nations of the world can,
if they have the will, take collective action for
peace and justice. It is a place where the guilt
can be squarely assigned to those who fail to take
all necessary steps to keep the peace. The United
Nations deserves our continued and ﬁrm support.
Forelln Asslstance and Trade
Now, in the practical application of our foreign
policy, we enter the ﬁeld of foreign assistance and
trade.
Military assistance must be continued. Tech-
nical assistance must be maintained. Economic
assistance can be reduced. However, our economic
programs in Korea and in a few other critical
places of the world are especially important, and
I shall ask Congress to continue support in these
particular spots in the next ﬁscal year.
The forthcoming budget message will propose
maintenance of the presidential power of transfer-
ability of all assistance funds and will ask author-
ity to merge these funds with the regular defense
