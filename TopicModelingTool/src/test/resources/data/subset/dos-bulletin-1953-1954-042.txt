cow and international communism; they impose
an alien minority rule by force and falsiﬁcation
on an intimidated, isolated and misinformed pop-
ulace; and they openly ﬂout every Chinese treaty
obligation, every principle of the U.N. charter
and every clause in any reasonable formulation of
human and pro erty rights for aliens.
Apart from t e horrors wantonly inﬂicted on
millions of Chinese since 1949, the story of the
ﬂagrant abuse of scores of American citizens is
e which rightfully causes us to burn with wrath.
7“ The shocking crimes against humanity of re-
cent years have blunted world sensitivity to mass
sadism so that we no longer seem to express the
full measure of our moral indignation against
these great wrongs. But we cannot lightly dis-
miss the agony of our fellow citizens arrested by
Chinese Communists on trumped-up char es; held
incommunicado for months or years wit out ac-
cess to friends or legal counsel and often with-
out knowledge of what offense if any is charged
against them; and in many cases subjected to
physical or mental tortures aimed at extorting
alse confessions that can be used in the vicious
hate-America propaganda campaign, a campaign
which unhappin may in time turn a new genera-
tion of Chinese against America and Americans
by a systematic poisoning of their minds against
this country beginning in childhood.
On grounds of international law, the case against
recognition is very strong. On practical grounds,
t argument is equally strong.
Recognition has assumed a political and sycho-
logical signiﬁcance which is new. It has come
a symbol. Recognition in this case would mean in
the eyes of millions, especially in Asia, not neces-
sarily approval but acceptance, accommodation,
and reconcilement.
Nonrecognition means refusal to accept the
Communist triumph as deﬁnitive. It means to
many that the will to resist Communist ex-
ansion is alive; that communism is not the
inevitable “wave of the future” for Asia; that
communism is not assured of acceptance and
legitimation in every country where it may gain
a beachhead; that our Asian friends who have the
courage to stand up against communism will not
have the ground cut out from under their feet if
communism should attempt to subvert or take
over their native land.
Some ma be unable to see why the recognition
issue slioul signify all this: but the fact is that it
does to many Asians, including numbers who are
“on the fence.” Many an Asian has told me that
American nonrecognition of the Communist re-
gime in Peiping has had much to do with checking
the impetus of the Communist advance in Asia.
Even Chinese who are not particularly in sym-
pathy with the Chinese National Government tell
us that recognition of the Communist dictators in
Peiping would be the greatest single nonmilitary
triumph for the Communist cause and the hardest
sychological blow against the will to resist the
¥urther spread of communism that could be
devised. _
It would be an unthinkable betrayal of the Chi-
nese GoVernment and its people on F ormosa and
likewise a grave disservice to the mass of Chinese
people on the mainland suﬂerin under Commu-
nist dictatorshi . Our friendship for them shall
not waver, an it demands that we shall not
strengthen the hand of their oppressor.
i'The Communist side is becoming increasingly
aware of the immense political and psychological
advantages, as well as the parliamenta advan-
tages in the United Nations, which con (1 be ob-
tained from general worldwide recognition of the
Peiping regime. Hence we are beginning to see a
series of maneuvers out of Moscow and Peiping
designed to force the general international accept-
ance of the Mao Tse-tung re 'me as the legitimate
government of China, entit ed to occupy China’s
seat in the United Nations. This endeavor must
be resisted.
We see in the arro ant, incorrigible, unyielding
position taken b hinese Communist mouth-
sieces wherever t ey appear at a conference how
iflicult it is to negotiate even the simplest matter
with them. The current negotiations in Korea are
an example. The patience, the ﬂexibility, the
opeii-niindedness, the reasonableness and resource-
fulness of even a consummately skilled negotiator
a e largely wasted.
There is nothing to be gained from diplomatic
relations with such a regime, which believes in the
use of diplomacy as a weapon of pro aganda and
subversion rather than as a means 0 constructive
di lomatic intercourse.
he ambitious plans of the Pei ing regime to
build its industrial base for wa through a com-
prehensive 5- car economic development plan are
deeply distur in . There is no reason to believe
that its longstanding plans for expansion in Asia
have been modiﬁed.
Korean Issue Remains Open
',' Even the aggression in Korea cannot be consid-
ered as terminated merely by an armistice. In
the absence of a satisfactory settlement in a politi-
cal conference, the Korean issue remains open.
The fundamental threat posed by the Pei ing
regime through its Korean aggression calls or a
continuance of the concerted UN. economic sanc-
tions which have been applied against it since
1951.
/\Ve believe that the regime, if allowed to carry
on foreign trade freely, would disregard the
normal consumer requirements of the Chinese peo-
ple and continue to impose the severest limitations
on imports of consumer goods, while concentrating
on strategic and industrial imports essential to
the build-up of a war economy which might later
be used against us.
