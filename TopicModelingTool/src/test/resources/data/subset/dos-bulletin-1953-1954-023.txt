and makes much sense. Only when his own sense
of values is clear may he, with courage and conﬁ-
dence, undertake the problems which have been
entrusted to him.
I fear there are some men who, when dealin
with ideas, operate on a “Lifo” principle. “Life
is a. recent invention of the chartered accountants
which means “last in—ﬁrst out.” The kind of in-
dividual I have in mind accepts what the last per-
son has said as his own opinion.
This sometimes brin about a sort of Gresham’s
law of ideas and belie s, by which the least valu-
able is given the greatest circulation. Good ideas
would drive out the bad if each man, before re-
issuing another’s opinion, would weigh it and
make sure it was sound.
In the inventory of ideas and beliefs, the
thoughtful businessman must have a strong con-
viction as to what kind of a country he wants his
country to be. He ﬁrst must learn what kind of a
country it is, and that is not easy when he ﬁnds
himself in the midst of the storms of current con-
troversy. He must have ideas as to what makes
his country strong, as well as to what makes for
weakness, and then strive to support the one and
overcome the other.
He must carry those convictions into his daily
tasks. To leave to others the considerations of
the general welfare is wrong. He, as an indi-
vidual, must act as though the responsibility for
the general welfare is solely his. This is not
always easy to do amid the uproar and cross
currents.
As opinions ain currency they are given labels.
The most famﬁiar labels are liberal and radical,
as opposed to conservative and reactionary—and
I am not speaking about any political parties.
These words are used as terms of reproach or self-
righteousness, depending upon the circumstances.
There have been times when they have been used
to rally friends or to denounce foes and have lost
all meaning.
If one is a conservative who wishes to hold to
that. which has proven worth while until some-
thing better has been proved, then certainly I am a
conservative.
On the other hand, I would also claim to be a
liberal if by liberal is meant one who, with an
open mind, is willing and ready to reexamine and
reevaluate any old institution or idea and be ﬂexi-
ble enough to strike out boldly on a new course if
such action is indicated.
Discrimination and sound judgments are the
important thin , not change for the sake of
change, nor foo ish loyalty to the old merely be-
cause it is old.
It would seem that our generation and the future
generations are bound to live in a world of crises.
This demands that we carefully review our way
of life, our ideas of freedom and of the dignity of
man and maintain their validity in this changing
world.
Current history has reduced one disaster after
another. lVe are shoc ed at the freedoms which
were lost in Nazi Germany and are still lost in
Communist Russia. These dreadful tragedies and
nightmares should make us much more ap recia-
tive of the values which we still possess. Fsome-
times wonder if it does, and if it does, we should
ask ourselves the question, “Are we doing any-
thi€€7g to help preserve these values?”
e condemn corruption and low moral stand-
ards in our public and national life. Yet there
seem to be too few who are willing to acknowledge
the real spiritual values and who earnestly strive
to continue the ancient truths from which our code
of morals 5 ring by supporting the or nized
churches an other spiritual agencies. e must
never lose our faith in God. S iritual things are
of much greater importance t an the material.
Halppiness comes from what we have in our hearts
an minds. We are great defenders of freedom of
speech, but not all of us can take criticism from
t ose who disagree. “’0 must never overlook the
homely virtues of thrift and hard work, which are
as necessary for success as they were a hundred
years ago.
Gentlemen, Canada and the United States are
great countries, wonderful countries. But those
are mere words unless we know why they are
great, and unless we, as individual citizens, strive
to continue and im rove those aspects of our coun-
try which have 1e to their greatness.
