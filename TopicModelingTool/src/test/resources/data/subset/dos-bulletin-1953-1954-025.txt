Having in mind the desirabilit of maintaining,
as in the past, the closest colla oration between
the Governments of Canada and the United States
in matters of common concern, President Eisen-
hower has asked me to seek the cooperation of
the Canadian Government in this matter. The
President is most anxious that a solution be found
which will cause the least possible damage to trade
relations between our two countries.
The Canadian Reply, December 10
MY DEAR Ma. Ac'rnvo SECRETARY:
The Government of Canada has given careful
consideration to your letter of December 7, 1953,
regarding the ur ent situation which is giving
concern to your Government with res ect to the
marketing of oats. The Canadian overnment
attaches the greatest importance to the extension
of mutually proﬁtable trade between our two coun-
tries and to avoidance of restrictions which would
interfere with such trade. However, in a desire
to meet President Eisenhower’s request for co-
operation towards the solution of this exceptional
and urgent problem, the Canadian Government
has decided, as a tem orary measure, and without
obligation, to take al practicable ste s to limit
shipments of Canadian oats to the United States
to the extent and for the period suggested in our
letter. In taking this action, the Canadian ov-
ernment is aware of the fact that your Govern-
ment is now reviewin its agricultural policies
with a view to ﬁnding ’longer-term solutions of a
constructive nature.
The Canadian Government takes note of the
information contained in our letter, that Canada
supplies almost the who e of the United States
imports of oats and only small quantities come
from other countries. The Canadian Government
wishes to make clear that it will reconsider the
decision set forth in this letter in the event that
substantial quantities of oats are imported into
the United States from other countries during the
period in question. The Canadian Government
assumes that in this event the Government of the
United States will itself also wish to review the
situation.
President Requests Study
of Rye Imports
White House press release dated December 10
The President on December 10 directed the
United States Tariff Commission to make an im-
mediate investigation of the elfects of rye imports,
including rye ﬂour and meal, on the domestic price
support program or rye and on the amount of
products processe in the United States from do-
mestic rye. The President, having been advised by
the Secretary of Agriculture, directed the Tariff
Cormniesion to make its investigation as provided
u/ndcr section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment
Act, as amended. Following is the text of the
President’s letter to Edgar B. Brossard, Chairman
of the Tar-if Commission:
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN:
I have been advised by the Secretary of Agricul-
ture that there is reason to believe that rye, includ-
ing rye ﬂour and meal, is racticall certain to be
imported into the United tates un er such condi-
tions and in such quantities as to render or tend to
render ineffective or materially interfere with the
price support program for rye undertaken by the
epartment 0 Agriculture pursuant to sections
301 and 401 of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as
amended, or to reduce substantially the amount
of products processed in the United States from
domestic rye.
The Department of Agriculture is sup orting
prices of rye and at the same time unusua i; large
imports of rye are occurring. The Tariﬁ Commis-
sion is directed to make an immediate investigation
of this matter in accordance with Executive Order
Number 7 233, dated November 23, 1935, promul-
gating regulations governing investigations under
section 22 of the Agricultural Ad'ustment Act, as
amended. The investigation an report of ﬁnd-
ings and recommendations of the Tariff Commis-
sion should be completed as promptly as prac-
ticable, to permit a decision as to whether action is
necessary under section 22 to be made as early as
possible.
The Commission shall determine whether rye,
including rye ﬂour and meal, is being or is prac-
tically certain to be imported under such condi-
tions and in such quantities as to render or tend
to render ineffective or materially interfere with
the rye price support program, or to reduce sub-
stantial] the amount of products processed in the
United tates from domestic rye.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
