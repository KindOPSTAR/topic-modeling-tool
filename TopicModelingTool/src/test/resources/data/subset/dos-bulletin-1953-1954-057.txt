(b) Include in such plan, to the maximum extent
feasible, a system of public works projects which the
two Governments determine to be desirable and prac-
ticable in order that both the country of Jordan and
the persons receiving assistance will receive maximum
beneﬁts.
(c) Pursue all appropriate measures to reduce its
relief needs, to increase production and supply, and to
improve the distribution of foodstuffs within Jordan in
order to lessen the danger of similar emergencies in
the future.

ﬁcations as may from time to time be mutually agreed
to be necessary to achieve the famine relief objective.

ferred to above and to enhance the value to Jordan of
the assistance program, the Government of the Hashemite
Kingdom of Jordan will establish in its own name a Spe-
cial Account in a bank in Jordan agreed upon by the two
Governments (hereinafter called the “Special Account“),
and will depoait in this account promptly amounts of
local currency accruing, after deducting the transporta-
tion expenses and handling costs to the Government of
the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, from the sale of wheat
supplied under this Agreement, or revenues otherwise
accruing to the Government of the Hashemite Kingdom
of Jordan as a result of the import of such wheat. The
Government of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan may
at any time make advance deposits in the Special Account.
4. The Government of the Hashemite Kingdom of
Jordan may draw from the Special Account such amounts
as may be agreed upon by the Government of the United
States of America and the Government of the Hashemite
Kingdom of Jordan to defray the expenses of public works
projects and other activities for the beneﬁt of the people
of Jordan agreed upon by the two Governments.
5. The Governments will, upon the request of either of
them, consult regarding any matter relating to the appli-
cation of this Agreement or to operations thereunder.
The Government of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan
will provide such information as may be necessary to
carry out the provisions of this Agreement, including
statements on the use of assistance received hereunder
and other relevant information which the Government of
the United States of America may need to determine the
nature and scope of its Operations under this Agreement
and to evaluate the effectiveness of the assistance fur-
nished or contemplated.
6. It is assumed that the Government of the Hashemite
Kingdom of Jordan will give full and continuous publicity
in Jordan to the objectives and progress of the program
under this Agreement, including information to the people
of Jordan that this program is evidence of the friend-
ship of the people of the United States of America for
them. The Government of the Hashemite Kingdom of
Jordan will make public, upon termination of this program
and at least once each quarter during the course of its
operation, full statements of operations hereunder, in-
cluding information as to the use of assistance received
and use of the local currency deposited in the Special
Account.
7. The Government of the Hashemite Kingdom of
Jordan agrees to permit representatives of the Govern-
ment of the United States of America to observe, without
restriction, the distribution in Jordan of wheat made avail-
able hereunder, including the provision of facilities neces-
sary for observation and review of the administration
of this Agreement and the use of assistance furnished,
and to receive any additional persons who may be neces-
sary for the purpose. Upon appropriate notiﬁcation from
the Government of the United States of America. the Gov-
ernment of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan will consider
such persons as part of the Diplomatic Mission of the
United States of America to the Hashemite Kingdom of
Jordan fer the purpose of enjoying the privileges and
immunities accorded to that Mission and its personnel
of comparable rank.
8. All or any part of the assistance provided hereunder
may be terminated by the Government of the United States
of America if it is determined that, because of changed
conditions, continuation of assistance is unnecessary or
undesirable. Termination of assistance under this pro-
vision may include the termination of deliveries of all
wheat scheduled hereunder and not yet delivered.
Upon receipt of a note from Your Excellency indicating
that the provisions set forth in this note are acceptable to
the Government of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan,
the Government of the United States of America will con-
sider that this note and your Excellency’s reply thereto
constitute an Agreement between the two Governments.

Excellency's note in reply.
