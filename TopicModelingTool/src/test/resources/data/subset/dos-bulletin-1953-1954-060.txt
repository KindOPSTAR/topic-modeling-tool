I am always glad to try to defer to the opinions of
the members and seek to clarify the point.
In this spirit, the sponsors of the resolution sug-
gest addin" a new paragraph—paragraph 14—to
read as fol ows:
Nothing in this resolution shall be deemed to supersede
the Armistice Agreement or to change the legal status of
the Demilitarized Zone thereunder.
This seems to us to be a concise way of removing
any doubts which may exist regarding the Chief
of Staﬂ’s consulting with the parties in accordance
with their rights and interests. We do not think
that the doubts reviously expressed are well
founded, but are g ad to go as far as we can to re-
solve them and in this spirit of helpfulness, we
propose this amendment.
