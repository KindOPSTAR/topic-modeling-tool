mountains in Af hanistan, right near the top of
the world; and t e magniﬁcence and delicacy of
Persian art in Tehran.
In addition we were entertained. “Ye were en-
tertained by emperors, by kings, by prime minis-
ters, by (11 lomats, and we received some me-
mentos of t 1e trip, some very beautiful and some
very signiﬁcant. I recall articularly that when
we were in Hong Kong, the Chinese community
there gave a dinner for us, and the memento that
they gave us was an ivory replica of the Statue of
Liberty. I have it here, and it’s interesting to
note—and this is an indication of the ﬁne work
that is done there—the detail, detail which would
never be done erhaps any place else in the world,
that around t e torch, inscribed in lettering so
small that it can’t be seen by the naked eye, is the
whole Declaration of Independence in Chinese
characters.
100,000 Handshake:
Well, so much for the things that we saw and
the things that we did. However, much as the
impression was that they made upon us, the great-
est impression that was made upon us was some-
thing very diﬁ'erent, and it was a result of
something we did that was different. You may
have read in the papers that in addition to seeing
the top otlicials of the governments of the countries
we visited, we made it a point to talk to workers
and farmers and schoolchildren. Mrs. Nixon,
while I had interviews with the prime ministers
and the kings and the emperors, visited hos itals
and orphanages and welfare institutions. \ e ﬁg-
ured up after we got back and we think that we
shook hands with over a hundred thousand people
in 2 months and 2 weeks. As a matter of fact we
even shook hands with some Communists. \Vhen
we were up in Pegu in Burma, they were picketing
us, and we walked right among them, met them,
greeted them, talked to them, and as a result of do-
m that the Communist demonstration broke up.
I have here, incidentally, some of the literature
that the were assing out. It’s addressed to
“Richardv Nixon, S( uire, Deputy Chief Executive
of the U. S. A.” at’s their term, I guess, for
Vice President.
But you ask this question: Well, wh see these
ordinary people? And I’ll tell you w y. There
were two purposes. We wanted them to know
America, and we wanted to know them. Because,
you see, a vicious smear of America and Americans
13 being made by the Communists all over the
world. They have created in the minds of the
people that we are arrogant, that we are mean,
that we are prejudiced, that we are superior, that
we are bent on war rather than on a program that
will lead to peace. And the only answer to such
ro aganda is not words. The only answer is
eegs. And so we decided to act just as we would
at home despite the warnings that were given us
that the people of Asia wouldn’t appreciate this
kind of approach, that they were different from
people of the United States. We found that they
weren’t nearly as different as we imagined or as
some of those who had been there before had told
us that they were. \Ve found that we were very
much more alike than we were different every
place that we went.
And I want to say in that connection that we
wanted to know what the people of Asia, the
people of the countries we visited, were like. \Vhat
were their aspirations? What were their hopes?
I think it’s pretty well summed up by what a very
wise and a very young king told me—the King of
Thailand. He was speaking about the needs of
Thailand, a country which is threatened from
Communist subversion within and possible Com—
munist aggression at any time, of course, from
without. He said they needed military assistance,
the needed economic assistance, and the needed
un erstanding. And signiﬁcantly enoug 1, he told
me that understanding was the most important of
the three.
Now let me say that all of you will of course
have the next question on your minds—what did
we ﬁnd as a result of this kind of approach? Well,
we found a great well of friendship for America.
We found, it is true, terrible poverty and hard-
ship. Let me give you some examples. We found
that in India, in portions of India, the per-capita
income is one-twentieth of what it is in Mississi i.
In Hong Kong I talked to a police sergeant. is
job was to register the hawkers, the unlicensed
salespeople on the street. And he said when they
came in that they would give addresses for a fam-
ily of ﬁve like this: “A stairway,” “a hallway,” “a
street corner.”
We found in the villages in some of the places
that we visited that they had desires for things
that we just take for ranted—for a school, a
ﬁrehouse, a water supp y, a sewer system. We
found children with yaws, and trachoma and
Mrs. Nixon visited hos itals in which she said the
sanitary facilities, not y choice but by necessity,
weren’t even equal to the kind of facilities we have
for animal hospitals in the United States. But in
spite of this poverty, in spite of this hardship,
we found fundamental courage and dignity and
decency among the ple every place that we
went. And des ite e fact that there were differ-
ent religions, iﬂ'erent music, different art, we
found the great majority of the people there were
like the majority of the people here in their beliefs.
They believe in the dignity of man, they believe
in the existence of a supreme being. They have a
patriotism and a love of country and they want
independence. They love their children, they
respect their parents just as people love their chil-
dren and respect their parents in the average
American family. lVe found that they can and
would like to be friends of America and the free
world. We found that they may be forced to be
powerful enemies.
