period, four of these on the night of 26 July. These latter
four sorties distributed “Operation Wind-up" leaflets
throughout North Korea, designed to create demands by
the Communist ﬁghting men upon their leaders to be
released from service now that the war was about over.
Other targets attacked by the Superforts were the Hong-
won marshuiling yard and the 'i‘aewo-rl supply area.
Combat cargo aircraft ﬁcw normal logistical airlift of
supplies, equipment and personnel in support of United
Nations Command operations in Korea.
In late July 1953, President Eisenhower directed that
distribution of about 10,000 tons of food he made to the
people of Korea, as a practical expression of the sincere
sympathy which the people of the United States feel for
the Koreans, and as a token of United States appreciation
for their valiant struggle against Communist aggression.
Food was obtained from reserve United States military
food stocks in Korea and Japan. Distribution was begun
in Pusan on 29 July 1953, in Seoul on 30 July, and in
Taegu and Taejon on 31 July. Every person in the
Republic of Korea is eligible to receive a food gift under
this program.
The United States Government authorized an initial
expenditure of $200 million for economic aid to the Repub-
lic of Korea,‘ to be undertaken immediately, in addition
to the existing co-ordinated United Nations Command-
United Nations Korean Reconstruction Agency program.
This authorization resulted from the report and recom-
mendations made to the President in July 1953 by Dr.
Henry J. Tasca who, as Special Representative of the
President for Korean Economic Affairs, conducted a sur-
vey in Korea on ways and means of strengthening the
Korean economy.‘
Agreement Reached on Program
for Strengthening Korean Economy
F allowing is the text of an agreement signed at
Seoul, Korea, on December 14:

air superiority displayed by United Nations Command air
wer.
poThe enemy made several last minute limited attacks to
acquire advantageous vantage points along the front line.
These thrusts were countered by air bombardments as
ﬁghter bomber, light bomber and medium bomber air-
craft dumped tons of ordnance on Communist positions.
Throughout the period the Sabrejets provided escort
and swept the northwest sector of Korea free of MIGs
in order that the ﬁghter bombers could attack their as-
signed ground targets without fear of Communist air at-
tack. In this role the Sabrejets destroyed twenty Mle,
probably destroyed two, and damaged eleven. During the
hours of darkness United Nations Command night ﬁghter
aircraft took over the counter air operations, providing
escort for the B—29s and intercepting aircraft of unknown
identity as detected by friendly ground radar screens.
Fighter bombers of the United Nations Command, while
engaged in airﬁeld neutralization and close support opera-
tions, still found time to maintain pressure upon the
enemy‘s transportation system and supply centers. Al-
though the period was marked by several days of non-
operationnl weather, every advantage was taken of the
opportunities presented whenever the skies cleared or the
overcast lifted to permit visual attacks against the enemy's
logistical network. Approximately two thousand sorties
were flown on interdiction and armed reconnaissance op-
erations as compared with over three thousand sorties
devoted to close support. These attacks resulted in the
destruction of buildings, vehicles, bridges, rallcars,
grounded enemy aircraft, supply stacks, personnel shelters,
a locomotive, an ammunition dump, and several gun posi-
tions. In addition, rails and roads were cut and troop
casualties were inﬁlcted. Runways were cratered or
enemy aircraft attacked at Pyongyang Main, Pyonggang,
l'iju, Taechon, Sinuiju Northeast, Sinuiju, Saamcham,
Pyong-ni, Namsi, Kangdong, Chunggangjin, Ongjin, and
Kanggye Number One airﬁelds.
Light bombers devoted the major portion of their effort
to the close support role. 0f almost one thousand sorties
ﬂown by these aircraft, approximately two thirds were in
close support of friendly ground forces and the remainder
were directed on armed reconnaissance and interdiction
missions. As in the past the majority of the effort took
place during the hours of darkness. Weather and bomb-
ing methmis precluded an assessment of the complete
results of these aircraft.
United Nations Command Superforts accomplished a
major airﬁeld neutralization program and were successful
in reducing all their assigned runway targets to an un-
tenable stnte. Over half of the two hundred plus sorties
completed by the Superforts during the twelve days period
were devoted to the airﬁeld program. The runways at
Uiju, Sinuiju, Namsi, Taechon, Pyong-ni, Pyongyang East,
Pyongyang Main and Saamchnm airﬁelds took several
poundings, and as of 27 July were left in a severely
cratered condition. Photography of 19 July revealed that
the Communists had slipped forty-three MiG-15s into
North Korea and parked them in revetments at Uiju
airﬁeld. Medium bomber strikes were immediately di-
rected against the runway to trap the Mle and a sub-
sequent strike against the revetted aircraft. These two
missions, atcomplishcd on the nights of 20 and 21 July
were successful in cratering the runway and possibly
destroying several of the revetted aircraft.
Medium bombers also performed eighty sorties expend-
ing about 720 tons of high explosive bombs on Communist
front line positions in close support of United Nations
Command ground forces. Three large scale missions were
accomplished in this phase of operation on the nights of
16, 17 and 18 July when twenty-three, twenty-three and
twenty-four sorties respectively, were effective.
The distribution of psychological warfare leaﬂets took
a back seat during the airﬁeld neutralization program as
almost the entire effort was required to accomplish this
priority mission. However, a total of eight medium
bomber leaﬁet sorties were ﬂown during the twelve day
COMBINED ECONOMIC BOARD AGREEMENT FOR A
PROGRAM OF ECONOMIC RECONSTRUCTION AND
FINANCIAL STABILIZATION
A Program of economic reconstruction and ﬁnancial
stabilization shall be designed to make a maximum con-
tribution towards expanding and strengthening the
Korean economy. The Use member of the Combined
Economic Board is impressed with the needs of the Korean
economy. Assuming. as both members of the Combined
Economic Board conﬁdently expect, the full cooperation
which has characterized the association of the Republic
of Korea and the United States of America, both in this
recovery program and in all other relationships, and pro-
vided also that the need for funds can be justiﬁed, the
Unc member, on his part, pledges his best efforts to obtain
such aid funds as are required for the achievement of the
basic objectives of this program. The ROK member of
the Combined Economic Board, on his part. plengs his
best efforts to cause the maximum amount of Korean
funds to be used in support of the common undertaking
to achieve reconstruction and rehabilitation of the Korean
economy.
As in all the relations between the Republic of Korea
and the United States of America, the program will be
carried out with full mutual respect for sQVereign rights.
