peaceful purposes. The President sought a “way
y which the miraculous inventiveness of man
shall not be dedicated to his death, but consecrated
to his life.”
In its response the Soviet Union expresses its
readiness to take part in conﬁdential or diplomatic
talks concerning the President’s proposal. This
is hopeful.
At the same time, the Soviet response criticizes
the President’s proposal on the ground that it will
not remove the threat of atomic weapons. It also
restates former positions taken by the Soviet
Meeting the People of Asla
by Vice President Nissan1
I appreciate the opportunity which has been
given me by the television and radio networks to
talk to you tonight in your homes about a art
of the world that we Americans know very little
about and about a part of the world which will
have a great effect on our future.
When the President suggested that I make this
report I debated on just what to say. It couldn’t
be a high policy speech because it is of course
the province of the President and the Secretary
of State to announce foreign-policy decisions. And
so what I tried to do is put myself in the place
of those of you who are listening and watching
this program. What are the questions you would
ask about the places that we have been if I were
to visit you tonight in your livin room? I jotted
some of them down, and I’m gomg to try to an-
swer them as well as I can.
First, and this is of course an important ques-
tion, why take such a trip at all? \Vhy should
Americans care what happens one-half way around
the world? There are two very good reasons for
taking such a trip. One hundred and ﬁfty thou-
sand Americans who were killed and wounded in
Korea are the best evidence that what happens
there in that part of the world affects us here.
And then when you consider the places we vis-
ited, consider the number of people who live there,
and when ou consider the breakdown in people
in the world, you will see why this trip was im-
portant.
Today there are approximately 540 million peo-
ple who can be counted on the side of the free
nations. There are 800 million on the Communist

Union. The Soviet Union seems not to have
caught the spirit of the President’s roposal. Its
ver purpose was to ﬁnd a new and 0 early feasible
basis which will permit of actually etting started.
It has long been evident, and t e tone of the
Soviet response makes it even clearer, that little
can be achieved b the continuance of public de-
bate. The Unite States will, through the new
channels which the Soviet Union now accepts, ex-
plore every possibility of securing agreement and
ringing President Eisenhower’s historic proposal
into the realm of creative action.
side. And there are 600 million others who must
be counted as noncommitted, and most of those 600
million live in the countries which we visited. The
Communists are making an all-out effort to win
this area. The best proof of that effort is the
fact that they waged war in Korea and they are
wagin war now in Indochina and in Malaya.
They ave stirred up revolutions in Burma and
Indonesia and the Philippines, and they have sup-
ported subversion everywhere in this area. If
they take this area, all of it or part of it, the bal-
ance of power in the world in people and resources
will be on their side, and the free world eventually
will be forced to its knees. It is vital therefore to
keep this part of the world from falling into Com-
munist hands.
And now another question which you might
ask would be this: What did we do, what are the
things that impressed us the most? Well, of
course, we have a lot of memories about this trip.
\Ve traveled a great deal by virtually every kind of
conveyance—by air, by automobile, by boat, by
carriage, by helicopter, by train, even once for a
few blocks by oxcart.
And we saw a number of great sights. The
spectacular scenic beauty of Australia and New
Zealand; the magniﬁcence of Boribidur in Indo-
nesia; Singapore, the crossroads of the Far East
with ships in the harbor from every count of
the world; the temple of the Emerald Bu dha
and the Grand Palace in Thailand; Fujiyama and
the shrines of Kyoto in Japan; Dewey Boulevard,
the vitality of our sister republic in the Philip-
pines with its great new leader President Mag-
saysay; the Taj Mahal in India; the courage, the
raw, robust strength of Karachi; the snowcapped
