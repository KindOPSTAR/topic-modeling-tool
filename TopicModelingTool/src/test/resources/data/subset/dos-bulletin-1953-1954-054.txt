DECEMBER 28, 1953
DEAR MR. PRESIDENT:
On the historic occasion of the one hundred and
ﬁftieth anniversary of your country’s independ-
ence on January ﬁrst, I take pleasure in extending
to the Government and peo e of Haiti the greet-
ings and best wishes of the overnment and people
of the United States.
That devotion to freedom which im elled Haiti
to achieve independence in 1804 had een demon-
strated a few years earlier in our own Revolution-
ary \Var by generous Haitian support at Savannah
and Yorktown. The spirit then exempliﬁed, con-
tinuing through the generations, is symbolic of the
friendship which is an enduring bond between our
peoples.
Sincerely,
Dwmu'r D. EISENHOWER
His Excellency
General PAUL E. MAGIDIRE, _
President of the Republic of Haiti,
Port-au-Prince.

DECEMBER 31, 1953
His Excellency
PIERRE L. Lmn‘rann,
Secretary of State for Foreign
Aﬁairs and Education,

My heartiest good wishes for the Government
and people of Haiti on this sesquicentennial of
your country’s independence.

Press release 681 dated December 81
The migrant labor agreement, between the
United States and Mexico under which Mexican
January II, 1954
agricultural workers are admitted into the United
States for emplo ment as farm laborers, which
was to expire on ecember 31, has been extended
to January 15, 1954 by an exchan e of notes be-
tween the Mexican Embassy in ashington and
the Department of State.
During the past two months the American
Ambassador to Mexico, Francis White, has con-
ducted negotiations with the Mexican Government
for the purpose of obtaining clariﬁcation of sev-
eral questions which have arisen under the present
a reement. The holida season caused suspension
0 these negotiations be ore it was possible for the
two Governments to agree on certain major issues.
In order to avoid any interruption in the co-
operative arrangements which have existed be-
tween the two overnments on this subject, the
agreement has been extended for a period of time
sufﬁcient to permit conclusion of the negotiations
now under way.
Tarlff Arrangement
Wlth Uruguay
WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCEMENT
White House press release dated December 24
The President on December 24 issued a procla-
mation giving effect as of December 16, 1953, to
certain U.S. tariff concessions initially negotiated
with Uruguay in 1949 within the framework of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
These concessions had been withheld pending
Uruguay’s accession to the agreement. Because of
the lapse of time since 1949 and the serious prob-
lems which have arisen in the cattle and beef in~
dustry in this country, the President is not in this
proclamation making effective the duty reductions
provided for in the 1949 agreement with respect
to canned beef, pickled and cured beef and veal,
and meat extract, but is binding the present rates
of duty on these items against increase. The US.
Government has initiated discussions with the
Uruguayan Government regarding these conces-
smns. A copy of the proclamation is attached.
The President’s action followed Uruguay‘s sig-
nature on November 16 1953, of the Annecy and
Torquay Protocols to the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, making Uruguay :1 part to
the agreement on December 16, 1953. ese
protocols provide that, on this date, Uruguay will
give effect to the concessions which it negotiated
at Annecy, France, in 1949, as modiﬁed and sup-
plemented by negotiations at Torquay, England,
in 1950—51, and that the other contracting
parties to the agreement will also give effect to
any concessions negotiated with Uruguay that may
